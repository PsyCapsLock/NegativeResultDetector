The Mereology of Depression-Networks of Depressive Symptoms during the Course of Psychotherapy,"Holler, I.; Schreiber, D.; Bos, F.; Forkmann, T.; Teismann, T.; Margraf, J.","(1) Background: Research has shown that it is important to examine depressive symptoms in the light of the mereology (the ratio between one symptom and the whole disorder). The goal of this study was to examine changes in the symptom interrelations of patients undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy treatment (CBT) via network analyses. (2) Method: Outpatients with depressive symptoms (N = 401) were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory three times (pretreatment, after 12 sessions, and post-treatment) during CBT. Gaussian graphical models were used to estimate the relationships among symptoms. (3) Results: The severity of depressive symptoms significantly decreased over the course of therapy, but connectivity in the networks significantly increased. Communities of symptoms changed during treatment. The most central and predictable symptom was worthlessness at baseline and after 12 sessions, and loss of energy and self-dislike at post-treatment. (4) Conclusion: The results indicate that the severity of depressive symptoms decreased during cognitive behavior therapy, while network connectivity increased. Furthermore, the associations among symptoms and their centrality changed during the course of therapy. Future studies may investigate individual differences and their impact on the planning of psychotherapeutic treatment.",2022,Jun 10,Int J Environ Res Public Health,19,12,7131,35742380.0,10.3390/ijerph19127131,,#1,Holler 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Winning the game: brain processes in expert, young elite and amateur table tennis players","Wolf, S.; Brolz, E.; Scholz, D.; Ramos-Murguialday, A.; Keune, P. M.; Hautzinger, M.; Birbaumer, N.; Strehl, U.","(1) compared with amateurs and young elite, expert table tennis players are characterized by enhanced cortical activation in the motor and fronto-parietal cortex during motor imagery in response to table tennis videos; (2) in elite athletes, world rank points are associated with stronger cortical activation. To this aim, electroencephalographic data were recorded in 14 expert, 15 amateur and 15 young elite right-handed table tennis players. All subjects watched videos of a serve and imagined themselves responding with a specific table tennis stroke. With reference to a baseline period, power decrease/increase of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) during the pretask- and task period indexed the cortical activation/deactivation (event-related desynchronization/synchronization, ERD/ERS). Regarding hypothesis (1), 8-10 Hz SMR ERD was stronger in elite athletes than in amateurs with an intermediate ERD in young elite athletes in the motor cortex. Regarding hypothesis (2), there was no correlation between ERD/ERS in the motor cortex and world rank points in elite experts, but a weaker ERD in the fronto-parietal cortex was associated with higher world rank points. These results suggest that motor skill in table tennis is associated with focused excitability of the motor cortex during reaction, movement planning and execution with high attentional demands. Among elite experts, less activation of the fronto-parietal attention network may be necessary to become a world champion.",2014,2014/10/27,Front Behav Neurosci,8,,370,25386126.0,10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00370,,#2,Wolf 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Alignment of the personality inventory for ICD-11 with the five-factor model of personality,"Stricker, J.; Buecker, S.; Pietrowsky, R.","A central innovation in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) is a dimensional personality disorder model differentiating five personality trait domains. The Personality Inventory for ICD-11 (PiCD) is a frequently used measure to assess these components of the ICD-11 personality disorder model. Conceptually, the ICD-11 personality trait domains correspond to trait domains from the five-factor model (FFM) of personality. However, empirically, it is unclear how the PiCD scales align with the FFM. In this questionnaire study with 480 German community adults, we assessed the joint factor structure of the PiCD trait domain scales and the FFM personality facets (assessed with the Big Five Inventory-2 [BFI-2]). A principal axis factor analysis revealed a joint five-factorial structure. The PiCD trait domain scales and the BFI-2 facet scales of the respectively corresponding FFM trait domains were almost perfectly aligned, including a bipolar anankastia-disinhibition factor along the conscientiousness dimension. Facets of openness to experience formed a fifth factor, separate from the PiCD scales. Together, these findings demonstrate structural correspondences of the PiCD trait domain scales and the respective BFI-2 facet scales, mirroring conceptual analogies between the ICD-11 and FFM personality models.

Development and Psychometric Properties of a Computer-Based Standardized Emotional Competence Inventory (MeKKi) for Preschoolers and School-Aged Children,"In-Albon, T.; Shafiei, M.; Christiansen, H.; Konen, T.; Gutzweiler, R.; Schmitz, J.","A computer-based emotional competence inventory for preschoolers and school-aged children (MeKKi) was developed to assess five components of emotional competence: emotion vocabulary, emotion identification (situational, visual, auditory), emotion understanding, emotion expression, and emotion regulation. Validity, reliability, and factor structure were examined in a community sample of 313 preschoolers and school-aged children (164 boys, 145 girls, 4 n.a.) age 4-11 years (M = 6.35 years, SD = 1.85). Item statistics and Cronbach's alpha were calculated for the subscales. The unidimensionality of the subscales was additionally tested via item response theory or confirmatory factor analysis. Internal consistency (alpha) was overall satisfactory at 0.82, though the consistencies of the Visual and Auditory Emotion Identification subscales were lower. Unidimensionality was demonstrated for all subscales except Emotion Understanding. Results provide support for the use of the MeKKi in research and clinical settings to assess emotional competence.",2022,Dec,Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,53,6,1207-1220,34117579.0,10.1007/s10578-021-01206-6,,#6,In-Albon 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Experience Versus Report: Where Are Changes Seen After Exposure-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy? A Randomized Controlled Group Treatment of Childhood Social Anxiety Disorder,"Asbrand, J.; Heinrichs, N.; Schmidtendorf, S.; Nitschke, K.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.","A considerable number of children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder (SAD) do not benefit from treatment as much as expected. However, treatment success should not be measured with social anxiety reports alone; the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological components of social stress should also be assessed. The authors examined an exposure-based SAD-specific group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in a randomized controlled trial (N = 67, age 9-13 years, blind randomized allocation to treatment [CBT; n = 31] and waitlist control [WLC; n = 36] groups). Success was operationalized as a clinically significant reduction of symptoms measured with SAD-specific questionnaires, structured interviews, and changes in response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). In the CBT group, there was a trend toward a significant increase in positive cognitions in the TSST after treatment (d = 0.37), whereas these positive cognitions decreased in the WLC group (d = 0.40). No significant results involving group appeared for negative cognitions, behavior and physiology. Children in the CBT group, but not parents, further reported less social anxiety in one questionnaire from pre- to post-treatment (d = 0.89). A structured interview confirmed a decrease in severity of SAD in the CBT group. While the gold standard of a blind interview showed efficacy of treatment, not all trait and state measures demonstrated similar success patterns.Trial registration Eligibility criteria and some of the dependent variables (cognitions, physiology) for treatment success were registered with the German Research Foundation (TU 78/5-2, HE 3342/4-2) prior to recruitment.

Emotion recognition in girls with conduct problems,"Schwenck, C.; Gensthaler, A.; Romanos, M.; Freitag, C. M.; Schneider, W.; Taurines, R.","A deficit in emotion recognition has been suggested to underlie conduct problems. Although several studies have been conducted on this topic so far, most concentrated on male participants. The aim of the current study was to compare recognition of morphed emotional faces in girls with conduct problems (CP) with elevated or low callous-unemotional (CU+ vs. CU-) traits and a matched healthy developing control group (CG). Sixteen girls with CP-CU+, 16 girls with CP-CU- and 32 controls (mean age: 13.23 years, SD=2.33 years) were included. Video clips with morphed faces were presented in two runs to assess emotion recognition. Multivariate analysis of variance with the factors group and run was performed. Girls with CP-CU- needed more time than the CG to encode sad, fearful, and happy faces and they correctly identified sadness less often. Girls with CP-CU+ outperformed the other groups in the identification of fear. Learning effects throughout runs were the same for all groups except that girls with CP-CU- correctly identified fear less often in the second run compared to the first run. Results need to be replicated with comparable tasks, which might result in subgroup-specific therapeutic recommendations.",2014,Jan,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,23,1,13-22,23568422.0,10.1007/s00787-013-0416-8,,#8,Schwenck 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Body image related negative interpretation bias in anorexia nervosa,"Brockmeyer, T.; Anderle, A.; Schmidt, H.; Febry, S.; Wunsch-Leiteritz, W.; Leiteritz, A.; Friederich, H. C.","A distorted body image and pronounced body dissatisfaction are hallmarks of anorexia nervosa (AN) that typically result in dietary restraint and compensatory behaviours. Cognitive biases such as negative interpretation bias are considered key maintaining factors of these maladaptive cognitions and behaviours. However, little attention has been paid to empirical tests whether negative interpretation bias exists in AN and to what degree it is associated with symptom severity. Participants in the present study were 40 women with AN and 40 healthy women with no history of an eating disorder. Body-related negative interpretation bias (i.e., a tendency to interpret ambiguous information about the own body in a negative way) was measured by a Scrambled Sentences Task. Patients with AN showed a stronger body-related negative interpretation bias than healthy controls. Within both groups, negative interpretation bias correlated strongly and positively with AN symptom severity and these effects were not moderated by levels of depressive symptoms. The findings support the idea that biased interpretation of body-related information is associated with the specific psychopathology of AN. Targeted, computerised interventions (e.g. interpretation bias modification) may help to alter these dysfunctional cognitive schemas that lie at the heart of AN.",2018,May,Behav Res Ther,104,,69-73,29567546.0,10.1016/j.brat.2018.03.003,,#9,Brockmeyer 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Effects of approach-avoidance training on implicit and explicit evaluations of neutral, angry, and smiling face stimuli","Woud, M. L.; Becker, E. S.; Lange, W. G.; Rinck, M.","A growing body of evidence shows that the prolonged execution of approach movements towards stimuli and avoidance movements away from them affects their evaluation. However, there has been no systematic investigation of such training effects. Therefore, the present study compared approach-avoidance training effects on various valenced representations of one neutral (Experiment 1, N = 85), angry (Experiment 2, N = 87), or smiling facial expressions (Experiment 3, N= 89). The face stimuli were shown on a computer screen, and by means of a joystick, participants pulled half of the faces closer (positive approach movement), and pushed the other half away (negative avoidance movement). Only implicit evaluations of neutral-expression were affected by the training procedure. The boundary conditions of such approach-avoidance training effects are discussed.",2013,Aug,Psychol Rep,113,1,1211-28,24340811.0,10.2466/21.07.pr0.113x10z1,,#10,Woud 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Olfactory Perception in Relation to the Physicochemical Odor Space,"Bierling, A. L.; Croy, I.; Hummel, T.; Cuniberti, G.; Croy, A.","A growing body of research aims at solving what is often referred to as the stimulus-percept problem in olfactory perception. Although computational efforts have made it possible to predict perceptual impressions from the physicochemical space of odors, studies with large psychophysical datasets from non-experts remain scarce. Following previous approaches, we developed a physicochemical odor space using 4094 molecular descriptors of 1389 odor molecules. For 20 of these odors, we examined associations with perceived pleasantness, intensity, odor quality and detection threshold, obtained from a dataset of 2000 naive participants. Our results show significant differences in perceptual ratings, and we were able to replicate previous findings on the association between perceptual ratings and the first dimensions of the physicochemical odor space. However, the present analyses also revealed striking interindividual variations in perceived pleasantness and intensity. Additionally, interactions between pleasantness, intensity, and olfactory and trigeminal qualitative dimensions were found. To conclude, our results support previous findings on the relation between structure and perception on the group level in our sample of non-expert raters. In the challenging task to relate olfactory stimulus and percept, the physicochemical odor space can serve as a reliable and helpful tool to structure the high-dimensional space of olfactory stimuli. Nevertheless, human olfactory perception in the individual is not an analytic process of molecule detection alone, but is part of a holistic integration of multisensory inputs, context and experience.",2021,Apr 28,Brain Sci,11,5,563,33925220.0,10.3390/brainsci11050563,,#11,Bierling 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Theory of Mind in Pre-school Aged Children: Influence of Maternal Depression and Infants' Self-Comforting Behavior,"Nonnenmacher, N.; Muller, M.; Taczkowski, J.; Zietlow, A. L.; Sodian, B.; Reck, C.","A milestone of child development is theory of mind (ToM): the ability to attribute mental states, especially beliefs and desires, to other persons and to understand that their behavior is guided by mental states. The learning process about the mental world also takes place in social communication and interaction, beginning in infancy. Infancy is assumed to be a sensitive period for the development of social skills through interaction. Due to limited self-regulatory skills, infants depend on sensitive behavior of their caregivers to regulate affective states and physiological arousal, and in turn, mutually regulated affects allow the infant to gradually acquire the capability to self-regulate negative affective states. Effective and adequate affect regulation is an important prerequisite for environmental interaction and thus for the development of socio-emotional skills. The present study investigated the relation of self-regulatory abilities in infancy and later ToM in pre-school aged children of clinically depressed mothers and healthy controls. The sample comprised of N = 55 mother-child dyads, n = 22 diagnosed with postpartum or lifetime depression according to DSM-IV and n = 33 healthy controls. Mother-infant-interaction was videotaped during the Face-to-Face Still-Face paradigm. At 3 and 42 months postpartum mothers were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) to evaluate maternal psychopathological status according to DSM-IV. At the age of M = 4.0 years, children's ToM abilities were assessed using content-false-belief and location-false-belief tasks. The results of this study show that contrary to our hypotheses, maternal depression did not impair the development of children's ToM-abilities per se. Rather, an interaction effect highlights the role of infant's self-comforting behavior during mother-infant interaction in infancy (3 months postpartum) for ToM-development at pre-school age assessed with the Maxi-task; this association was distinct for female in comparison to male children. The results of this longitudinal study shed light on the discussion, how maternal depression influences child development and point in the direction that self-comforting behaviors in infancy can also be seen as a resource.",2021,2021/11/24,Front Psychol,12,,741786,34899482.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.741786,,#13,Nonnenmacher 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Personality types revisited-a literature-informed and data-driven approach to an integration of prototypical and dimensional constructs of personality description,"Kerber, A.; Roth, M.; Herzberg, P. Y.","A new algorithmic approach to personality prototyping based on Big Five traits was applied to a large representative and longitudinal German dataset (N = 22,820) including behavior, personality and health correlates. We applied three different clustering techniques, latent profile analysis, the k-means method and spectral clustering algorithms. The resulting cluster centers, i.e. the personality prototypes, were evaluated using a large number of internal and external validity criteria including health, locus of control, self-esteem, impulsivity, risk-taking and wellbeing. The best-fitting prototypical personality profiles were labeled according to their Euclidean distances to averaged personality type profiles identified in a review of previous studies on personality types. This procedure yielded a five-cluster solution: resilient, overcontroller, undercontroller, reserved and vulnerable-resilient. Reliability and construct validity could be confirmed. We discuss wether personality types could comprise a bridge between personality and clinical psychology as well as between developmental psychology and resilience research.",2021,2021/01/07,PLOS ONE,16,1,e0244849,33411758.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0244849,,#14,Kerber 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Oxytocin differentially modulates eye gaze to naturalistic social signals of happiness and anger,"Domes, G.; Steiner, A.; Porges, S. W.; Heinrichs, M.","A number of previous studies has shown that oxytocin (OT) promotes facial emotion recognition and enhances eye gaze to facial stimuli in humans. Other studies report valence-specific effects of OT, supporting the proposed prosocial role of OT in social interactions. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis whether OT might selectively enhance eye gaze to positive, approach-related, but not to negative, threat-related social cues. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subject design, we assessed the effects of intranasal OT administration (24 IU) in 62 healthy male volunteers on eye gaze toward the eyes of neutral, positive (happy) and negative (angry) facial expressions compared with placebo. In order to capture the dynamics of facial expressions, we used video sequences showing neutral faces gradually displaying a specific emotion. In line with previous studies, OT increased eye gaze toward neutral facial expressions. Moreover, under OT treatment, eye gaze remained increased when the face showed a happy facial expression, but in contrast decreased when the face displayed an angry expression. These results support the notion that OT differentially modulates visual attention toward social signals of positive approach and threat and thereby contributes to the modulation of non-verbal interpersonal communication.",2013,Jul,Psychoneuroendocrinology,38,7,1198-202,23117026.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.10.002,,#15,Domes 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Predicting intelligence from brain gray matter volume,"Hilger, K.; Winter, N. R.; Leenings, R.; Sassenhagen, J.; Hahn, T.; Basten, U.; Fiebach, C. J.","A positive association between brain size and intelligence is firmly established, but whether region-specific anatomical differences contribute to general intelligence remains an open question. Results from voxel-based morphometry (VBM) - one of the most widely used morphometric methods - have remained inconclusive so far. Here, we applied cross-validated machine learning-based predictive modeling to test whether out-of-sample prediction of individual intelligence scores is possible on the basis of voxel-wise gray matter volume. Features were derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging data (N = 308) using (a) a purely data-driven method (principal component analysis) and (b) a domain knowledge-based approach (atlas parcellation). When using relative gray matter (corrected for total brain size), only the atlas-based approach provided significant prediction, while absolute gray matter (uncorrected) allowed for above-chance prediction with both approaches. Importantly, in all significant predictions, the absolute error was relatively high, i.e., greater than ten IQ points, and in the atlas-based models, the predicted IQ scores varied closely around the sample mean. This renders the practical value even of statistically significant prediction results questionable. Analyses based on the gray matter of functional brain networks yielded significant predictions for the fronto-parietal network and the cerebellum. However, the mean absolute errors were not reduced in contrast to the global models, suggesting that general intelligence may be related more to global than region-specific differences in gray matter volume. More generally, our study highlights the importance of predictive statistical analysis approaches for clarifying the neurobiological bases of intelligence and provides important suggestions for future research using predictive modeling.",2020,Sep,Brain Struct Funct,225,7,2111-2129,32696074.0,10.1007/s00429-020-02113-7,,#16,Hilger 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Use of machine learning to classify adult ADHD and other conditions based on the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales,"Christiansen, H.; Chavanon, M. L.; Hirsch, O.; Schmidt, M.

ADHD is associated with gambling disorder and obesity, showing overlaps of about 20% with each diagnosis.

Applying the LightGBM algorithm in machine learning, we were able to differentiate subjects with ADHD, obesity, problematic gambling, and a control group using all 26 items of the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS-S: S) with a global accuracy of .80; precision (positive predictive value) ranged between .78 (gambling) and .92 (obesity), recall (sensitivity) between .58 for obesity and .87 for ADHD.

Expectation of exercise in trained athletes results in a reduction of central processing to nociceptive stimulation,"Geisler, M.; Eichelkraut, L.; Miltner, W. H. R.; Weiss, T.","A single endurance exercise session was shown to lead to a reduction of pain perception and an elevation of mood. We hypothesized that athletes, who regularly practice endurance, might also induce changes in mood and pain processing in expectation of an endurance session. We compared the expectation effects of a 2-h-run on mood and pain processing to a run-free control day (RFC). Fifteen trained runners were assessed with repeated painful and nonpainful pinprick stimulation in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner prior to a 2-h-run and at RFC. Pain ratings, pressure pain stimulus-response functions, and euphoria ratings were also assessed. There were no mean expectation effects on any of the behavioral measures. However, highly trained athletes needed more pressure to evoke a pain rating of 46 pre-run vs. RFC but were less euphoric pre-run vs. RFC. Furthermore, analysis of brain activities to painful stimuli applied immediately before the 2-h-run compared to RFC revealed increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and reduced activation in posterior insula. Additionally, less trained athletes had reduced activation in posterior insula to painful stimulation pre-run vs. RFC compared to highly trained athletes. The results suggest reduced central pain processing in expectation of an endurance run and an association between the amount of the expectation effect and training frequency which differs depending on the stimuli applied.",2019,Jan 1,Behav Brain Res,356,,314-321,30189288.0,10.1016/j.bbr.2018.08.036,,#18,Geisler 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Generalization of appetitive conditioned responses,"Andreatta, M.; Pauli, P.","A stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) associated with an appetitive unconditioned stimulus (US) acquires positive properties and elicits appetitive conditioned responses (CR). Such associative learning has been examined extensively in animals with food as the US, and results are used to explain psychopathologies (e.g., substance-related disorders or obesity). Human studies on appetitive conditioning exist, too, but we still know little about generalization processes. Understanding these processes may explain why stimuli not associated with a drug, for instance, can elicit craving. Forty-seven hungry participants underwent an appetitive conditioning protocol during which one of two circles with different diameters (CS+) became associated with an appetitive US (chocolate or salty pretzel, according to participants' preference) but never the other circle (CS-). During generalization, US were delivered twice and the two CS were presented again plus four circles (generalization stimuli, GS) with gradually increasing diameters from CS- to CS+. We found successful appetitive conditioning as reflected in appetitive subjective ratings (positive valence, higher contingency) and physiological responses (startle attenuation and larger skin conductance responses) to CS+ versus CS-, and, importantly, both measures confirmed generalization as indicated by generalization gradients. Small changes in CS-US contingency during generalization may have weakened generalization processes on the physiological level. Considering that appetitive conditioned responses can be generalized to non-US-associated stimuli, a next important step would be to investigate risk factors that mediate overgeneralization.",2019,Sep,Psychophysiology,56,9,e13397,31152454.0,10.1111/psyp.13397,,#19,Andreatta 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Hydrocortisone accelerates the decay of iconic memory traces: on the modulation of executive and stimulus-driven constituents of sensory information maintenance,"Miller, R.; Weckesser, L. J.; Smolka, M. N.; Kirschbaum, C.; Plessow, F.","A substantial amount of research documents the impact of glucocorticoids on higher-order cognitive functioning. By contrast, surprisingly little is known about the susceptibility of basic sensory processes to glucocorticoid exposure given that the glucocorticoid receptor density in the human visual cortex exceeds those observed in prefrontal and most hippocampal brain regions. As executive tasks also rely on these sensory processes, the present study investigates the impact of glucocorticoid exposure on different performance parameters characterizing the maintenance and transfer of sensory information from iconic memory (IM; the sensory buffer of the visual system) to working memory (WM). Using a crossover factorial design, we administered one out of three doses of hydrocortisone (0.06, 0.12, or 0.24mg/kg bodyweight) and a placebo to 18 healthy young men. Thereafter participants performed a partial report task, which was used to assess their individual ability to process sensory information. Blood samples were concurrently drawn to determine free and total cortisol concentrations. The compiled pharmacokinetic and psychophysical data demonstrates that free cortisol specifically accelerated the decay of sensory information (r=0.46) without significantly affecting the selective information transfer from IM to WM or the capacity limit of WM. Specifically, nonparametric regression revealed a sigmoid dose-response relationship between free cortisol levels during the testing period and the IM decay rates. Our findings highlight that glucocorticoid exposure may not only impact on the recruitment of top-down control for an active maintenance of sensory information, but alter their passive (stimulus-driven) maintenance thereby changing the availability of information prior to subsequent executive processing.",2015,Mar,Psychoneuroendocrinology,53,,148-58,25618593.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.12.016,,#20,Miller 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
From decision to action: Suicidal history and time between decision to die and actual suicide attempt,"Paashaus, L.; Forkmann, T.; Glaesmer, H.; Juckel, G.; Rath, D.; Schonfelder, A.; Teismann, T.","A substantial proportion of suicide attempts seem to be realized in a sudden manner.

In the neutral weather-prediction task, rainy and sunny weather had to be predicted. In the emotional task danger of an epidemic from virus infection had to be predicted (epidemic-prediction task). Participants with OCD were as able as controls to improve their prediction of neutral events across learning trials but scored significantly below healthy controls on the epidemic-prediction task. Lower performance on the emotional task variant was significantly related to a heightened tendency to overestimate threat.

We addressed this question in a 9-month longitudinal study in which participants (N = 332) took part in three distinct 3-month mental training modules cultivating attentional (the Presence module), sociocognitive (the Perspective module), and socioaffective, compassion-based skills (the Affect module). In addition, the participants completed the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Brief COPE Inventory at baseline and after every module. The Presence module did not notably change the use of any emotion regulation strategies, whereas the Perspective and the Affect modules both increased the use of acceptance. Moreover, the Perspective module was especially effective in increasing the use of adaptive, cognitive transformations such as reappraisal, perspective taking, and planning, whereas the Affect module uniquely led to decreases in maladaptive avoidant strategies such as distraction and refocusing. These findings imply that (a) cultivating present-moment focused attention might not be sufficient to change emotion regulation strategies, (b) different types of mental practices focusing on either cognitive perspective taking or sociomotivational capacities lead to adaptive emotion regulation via different strategies, and (c) specifically cultivating positive affect and compassion can decrease avoidance of difficult emotions. This research suggests that different mental training exercises affect the use of specific emotion regulation strategies and that clinical interventions should be designed accordingly.

Nucleus accumbens activation is linked to salience in social decision making,"Schmidt, S. N. L.; Fenske, S. C.; Kirsch, P.; Mier, D.","Aberrant salience may explain hasty decision making and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. In healthy individuals, final decisions in probabilistic reasoning tasks are related to Nucleus accumbens (Nacc) activation. However, research investigating the Nacc in social decision making is missing. Our study aimed at investigating the role of the Nacc for social decision making and its link to (aberrant) salience attribution. 47 healthy individuals completed a novel social jumping-to-conclusion (JTC) fMRI-paradigm, showing morphed faces simultaneously expressing fear and happiness. Participants decided on the 'current' emotion after each picture, and on the 'general' emotion of series of faces. Nacc activation was stronger during final decisions than in previous trials without a decision, particularly in fear rather than happiness series. A JTC-bias was associated with higher Nacc activation for last fearful, but not last happy faces. Apparently, mechanisms underlying probabilistic reasoning are also relevant for social decision making. The pattern of Nacc activation suggests salience, not reward, drives the final decision. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that aberrant salience might also explain social-cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",2019,Sep,Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,269,6,701-712,30361926.0,10.1007/s00406-018-0947-6,,#24,Schmidt 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Hippocampal CA1 deformity is related to symptom severity and antipsychotic dosage in schizophrenia,"Zierhut, K. C.; Grassmann, R.; Kaufmann, J.; Steiner, J.; Bogerts, B.; Schiltz, K.","Abnormalities of the hippocampus are intricately involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Hippocampal volume decrease is present at disease onset and has mainly been observed in the anterior and posterior part of the hippocampus. Nevertheless, an association between regionally specific hippocampal shape deformities putatively affecting a pathophysiologically crucial region, i.e. cornu ammonis field 1 (CA1), and symptomatology as well as required maintenance medication has not been observed. The aim of this study was to characterize the relationship between CA1-specific hippocampal surface deformations and symptom severity. Furthermore, we aimed to explore whether such specific morphological hippocampus abnormalities statistically predict the maintenance dosage of antipsychotic medication. Hippocampal shape and volume were determined by manual segmentation of high resolution, whole brain, three-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Associations between hippocampal volume, specific shape deformities in CA1, and positive and negative symptoms were assessed in 32 patients with schizophrenia and compared with 34 healthy control subjects. In addition to volume reductions of the left hippocampus, patients with schizophrenia displayed specific shape deformities in the left anterior and posterior CA1 subfield. Overall, the severity of positive symptoms was closely associated to these morphological deformities, specifically delusions and hallucinations. In addition, CA1 deformity was linked to the required antipsychotic dosage. Findings were replicated in a second, independent sample. Hippocampal CA1 deformity, possibly reflecting shrinkage, might result from a specific hyperactivity, leading to a circumscribed volume loss. Owing to its physiological function, deficits in CA1 may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of hallucinations and delusions, core symptoms in schizophrenia.",2013,Mar,Brain,136,Pt 3,804-14,23388407.0,10.1093/brain/aws335,,#25,Zierhut 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Heart-related anxieties in relation to general anxiety and severity of illness in cardiology patients,"Muschalla, B.; Glatz, J.; Linden, M.","Absence of an adequate reason for anxiety is a criterion for pathological anxiety. However, the presence of danger or fear-provoking stimuli may even be a risk factor for anxiety and does not exclude that there is additionally pathological anxiety too. The question is, to what degree can heart-related anxiety be explained by the severity of illness or trait anxiety? Two hundred and nine patients (37.8% women) from a cardiology inpatient unit completed the Heart-Anxiety-Questionnaire, Progression-Anxiety-Questionnaire, Job-Anxiety-Scale and the State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory. The severity of cardiac illness was rated by the treating cardiologists using the Multidimensional Severity of Morbidity Rating. Time absent from work due to sickness was assessed as an indicator for illness-related impairment. Heart anxiety was significantly related to progression anxiety and, to a lesser extent, trait anxiety and indicators of subjective symptoms of somatic illness. No association was found with medical ratings for prognosis, multimorbidity, or reduction in life expectancy. Heart-related anxiety is a symptom of an anxiety disorder. Although partially dependent on subjective suffering, it cannot be explained by the severity of medical illness.

Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic posed an unprecedented burden on the mental health of many individuals. Therefore, we cross-sectionally investigated how doctoral researchers (N = 222) evaluate their mental health status and satisfaction with their PhD training before and during the pandemic. As compared to self-reported, retrospective evaluations about the pre-pandemic state, we found decreased satisfaction with PhD training and overall well-being. The whole sample exhibited high levels of personal and work-related burnout, a fifth indicated clinically meaningful levels of depressive symptoms and almost 25% experienced severe loneliness. When exploring predictors of depression, anxiety, and burnout, we identified low satisfaction with PhD training as the most prominent predictor for poor mental health, suggesting a link between the doctoral work and their mental health status. Females vs. males and doctoral researchers in individual doctorate vs. structured PhD programs reported higher symptoms of burnout. Our study replicates previous findings of poor mental health in doctoral researchers and indicates further decreases of mental wellbeing under the influence of the pandemic.

Acceptance-Based Emotion Regulation Reduces Subjective and Physiological Pain Responses,"Haspert, V.; Wieser, M. J.; Pauli, P.; Reicherts, P.","Acceptance-based regulation of pain, which focuses on the allowing of pain and pain related thoughts and emotions, was found to modulate pain. However, results so far are inconsistent regarding different pain modalities and indices. Moreover, studies so far often lack a suitable control condition, focus on behavioral pain measures rather than physiological correlates, and often use between-subject designs, which potentially impede the evaluation of the effectiveness of the strategies. Therefore, we investigated whether acceptance-based strategies can reduce subjective and physiological markers of acute pain in comparison to a control condition in a within-subject design. To this end, participants (N = 30) completed 24 trials comprising 10 s of heat pain stimulation. Each trial started with a cue instructing participants to welcome and experience pain (acceptance trials) or to react to the pain as it is without employing any regulation strategies (control trials). In addition to pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings, heart rate (HR) and skin conductance (SC) were recorded. Results showed significantly decreased pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings for acceptance compared to control trials. Additionally, HR was significantly lower during acceptance compared to control trials, whereas SC revealed no significant differences. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of acceptance-based strategies in reducing subjective and physiological pain responses relative to a control condition, even after short training. Therefore, the systematic investigation of acceptance in different pain modalities in healthy and chronic pain patients is warranted.",2020,2020/06/30,Front Psychol,11,,1514,32695054.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01514,,#28,Haspert 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Temporal stability and effect dynamics between executive functions, perceived chronic stress, and hair cortisol concentrations","Weckesser, L. J.; Schmidt, K.; Moschl, M.; Kirschbaum, C.; Enge, S.; Miller, R.","Accidents caused by human errors illustrate the fragility of cognitive processing and its coordination by executive functions against stress. To better understand how core executive functions change over time, influence each other, and are affected by chronic stress exposure, a prospective cohort study was conducted from 2016 to 2019. Five hundred sixteen German adults aged 25-55 years (mean age/education age: 38.0/11.3 years, 67% females, 94% occupied, 20% smokers) completed at least one internet-based biannual assessment of response inhibition, updating, and set shifting using a Go/NoGo, spatial 2-Back, and Number-Letter task, respectively. Chronic stress exposure was indicated by self-reports on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC). Statistical analyses were performed by multivariate stochastic differential equation modeling. All indicators of executive functions (task-specific RTs in target trials or their contrast to nontarget trials) and chronic stress showed intraindividual stability over time (12% to 63% of their variance was attributable to trait influences). With respect to lagged mutual associations, faster Go/NoGo target RTs predicted faster Number-Letter target RTs later in time, while faster Number-Letter target RTs predicted higher HCC later in time (both with maximum effect sizes of d approximately 0.1 standard deviations). However, PSS was not predictive of later HCC and vice versa. None of the chronic stress indicators significantly predicted indicators of executive functions at subsequent time points. These findings suggest that set shifting is capable of modulating the body's physiological response to chronic stress exposure, whereas executive functions appear comparably robust against chronic stress exposure.

(Sub-) clinical samples with OCD have reported higher anger and anger suppression. Patients with checking-related symptoms of OCD showed a less aggressive self-concept as assessed by an Implicit Association Test (IAT). This study assessed anger and aggressiveness self-concepts in OCD as well as possible mediators of the link between OCD and aggressiveness. A total of 48 patients with OCD and 45 healthy controls were included. Measures included the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-II and an aggressiveness self-concept IAT (Agg-IAT). An inflated sense of responsibility, non-acceptance of emotions, and social desirability were tested as mediators. As expected, patients with OCD reported higher trait anger and anger suppression compared to healthy controls. Contrary to hypotheses, the aggressiveness self-concept (Agg-IAT) did not differ between groups. The inflated sense of responsibility mediated the relationship between group and anger suppression. Non-acceptance of negative emotions mediated the relationship between group and trait anger, as well as anger suppression. However, comorbidities and medication may account for some effect in anger suppression. Elevated trait anger and anger suppression in OCD patients could be explained by dysfunctional beliefs or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies.

Items on the RBF-D were selected to reflect 5 aspects of responsive sexual desire: sexual activity with a primary partner, sexual desire for a primary partner, sexual activity with other persons, sexual desire for other persons, and autoerotic activities. A 5-factor solution was confirmed via exploratory structural equation modeling. Internal consistency of 4 out of 5 factors was good. Convergent validity was established via small to medium associations of the RBF-D factors with other measures of sexual desire.

Direct and indirect assessment of perfectionism in patients with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Cludius, B.; Landmann, S.; Kulz, A.

One dysfunctional belief that has been found to be associated with several psychological disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), is perfectionism. Perfectionism comprises two factors, namely, perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns. This study aims to replicate and extend previous research in several ways. We aimed to assess similarities between the two disorders using Bayesian statistics. Furthermore, as dysfunctional beliefs are assumed to not be fully accessible by introspection, we included an indirect measure (perfectionism single category implicit association task; SC-IAT). The SC-IAT and a self-report measure of perfectionism (FMPS) was used in patients with MDD (n = 55), OCD (n = 55), and in healthy controls (n = 64). In replication of previous findings, patients with MDD and OCD differed from healthy controls regarding self-reported perfectionism scores. Furthermore, Bayesian statistics showed that the two patient groups did not differ regarding perfectionistic strivings and only showed differences on perfectionistic concerns, when the doubts about actions subscale-which is also closely related to symptoms of OCD-was included. Contrary to our expectations, the SC-IAT did not discriminate groups.

"Assessment of Tobacco-Related Approach and Attentional Biases in Smokers, Cravers, Ex-Smokers, and Non-Smokers","Woud, M. L.; Maas, J.; Wiers, R. W.; Becker, E. S.; Rinck, M.","According to theories of addictive behaviors, approach and attentional biases toward smoking-related cues play a crucial role in tobacco dependence. Several studies have investigated these biases by using various paradigms in different sample types. However, this heterogeneity makes it difficult to compare and evaluate the results. The present study aimed to address this problem, via (i) a structural comparison of different measures of approach-avoidance and a measure of smoking-related attentional biases, and (ii) using within one study different representative samples in the context of tobacco dependence. Three measures of approach-avoidance were employed: an Approach Avoidance Task (AAT), a Stimulus Response Compatibility Task (SRC), and a Single Target Implicit Association Test (ST-IAT). To assess attentional biases, a modified Stroop task including smoking-related words was administered. The study included four groups: n = 58 smokers, n = 57 non-smokers, n = 52 cravers, and n = 54 ex-smokers. We expected to find strong tobacco-related approach biases and attentional biases in smokers and cravers. However, the general pattern of results did not confirm these expectations. Approach responses assessed during the AAT and SRC did not differ between groups. Moreover, the Stroop did not show the expected interference effect. For the ST-IAT, cravers had stronger approach associations toward smoking-related cues, whereas non-smokers showed stronger avoidance associations. However, no such differences in approach-avoidance associations were found in smokers and ex-smokers.

Fear generalization of implicit conditioned facial features - Behavioral and magnetoencephalographic correlates,"Roesmann, K.; Wiens, N.; Winker, C.; Rehbein, M. A.; Wessing, I.; Junghoefer, M.","Acquired fear responses often generalize from conditioned stimuli (CS) towards perceptually similar, but harmless generalization stimuli (GS). Knowledge on similarities between CS and GS may be explicit or implicit. Employing behavioral measures and whole-head magnetoencephalography, we here investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning implicit fear generalization. Twenty-nine participants underwent a classical conditioning procedure in which 32 different faces were either paired with an aversive scream (16 CS+) or remained unpaired (16 CS-). CS+ and CS- faces systematically differed from each other regarding their ratio of eye distance and mouth width. High versus low values on this ""threat-related feature (TF)"" implicitly predicted the presence or absence of the aversive scream. In pre- and post-conditioning phases, all CS and 32 novel GS faces were presented. 16 GS+ ​faces shared the TF of the 16 CS+ ​faces, while 16 ​GS- faces shared the TF of the 16 CS- faces. Behavioral tests confirmed that participants were fully unaware of TF-US contingencies. CS+ ​compared to CS- faces revealed higher unpleasantness, arousal and US-expectancy ratings. A generalization of these behavioral fear responses to GS+ ​compared to GS- faces was observed by trend only. Source-estimations of event-related fields showed stronger neural responses to both CS+ and GS+ ​compared to CS- and GS- in anterior temporal (<100 ​ms) and temporo-occipital (<150 ​ms; 553-587 ​ms) ventral brain regions. Reverse effects were found in dorsal frontal areas (<100 ​ms; 173-203 ​ms; 257-290 ​ms). Neural data also revealed selectively enhanced responses to CS+ ​but not GS+ ​stimuli in occipital regions (110-167 ​ms; 330-413 ​ms), indicating perceptual discrimination. Our data suggest that the prioritized perceptual analysis of threat-associated conditioned faces in ventral networks rapidly generalizes to novel faces sharing threat-related features. This generalization process occurs in absence of contingency awareness and may thus contribute to implicit attentional biases. The coexisting perceptual discrimination suggests that fear generalization is not a mere consequence of insufficient stimulus discrimination but rather an active, integrative process.",2020,Jan 15,NeuroImage,205,,116302,31639511.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116302,,#38,Roesmann 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Height Simulation in a Virtual Reality CAVE System: Validity of Fear Responses and Effects of an Immersion Manipulation,"Gromer, D.; Madeira, O.; Gast, P.; Nehfischer, M.; Jost, M.; Muller, M.; Muhlberger, A.; Pauli, P.","Acrophobia is characterized by intense fear in height situations. Virtual reality (VR) can be used to trigger such phobic fear, and VR exposure therapy (VRET) has proven effective for treatment of phobias, although it remains important to further elucidate factors that modulate and mediate the fear responses triggered in VR. The present study assessed verbal and behavioral fear responses triggered by a height simulation in a 5-sided cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE) with visual and acoustic simulation and further investigated how fear responses are modulated by immersion, i.e., an additional wind simulation, and presence, i.e., the feeling to be present in the VE. Results revealed a high validity for the CAVE and VE in provoking height related self-reported fear and avoidance behavior in accordance with a trait measure of acrophobic fear. Increasing immersion significantly increased fear responses in high height anxious (HHA) participants, but did not affect presence. Nevertheless, presence was found to be an important predictor of fear responses. We conclude that a CAVE system can be used to elicit valid fear responses, which might be further enhanced by immersion manipulations independent from presence.

Together, these processes inform clinical safety planning and our therapeutic tools accommodate a reasonable degree of idiosyncrasy when we individualize interventions. Unraveling these multifaceted factors and processes on a quantitative level, however, requires estimation frameworks capable of representing idiosyncrasies relevant to intervention and psychotherapy. Using, data from a 21-day ambulatory assessment protocol that included six random prompts per day, we developed personalized (i.e., idiographic) models of interacting risk factors and suicidal ideation via Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) in a sample of people diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (N = 95) stratified for a history of high lethality suicide attempts. Our models revealed high levels of heterogeneity in state risk factors related to suicidal ideation, with no features shared among the majority of participants or even among relatively homogenous clusters of participants (i.e., empirically derived subgroups).

The Error-Related Negativity Predicts Self-Control Failures in Daily Life,"Overmeyer, R.; Berghauser, J.; Dieterich, R.; Wolff, M.; Goschke, T.; Endrass, T.","Adaptive behavior critically depends on performance monitoring (PM), the ability to monitor action outcomes and the need to adapt behavior. PM-related brain activity has been linked to guiding decisions about whether action adaptation is warranted. The present study examined whether PM-related brain activity in a flanker task, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), was associated with adaptive behavior in daily life. Specifically, we were interested in the employment of self-control, operationalized as self-control failures (SCFs), and measured using ecological momentary assessment. Analyses were conducted using an adaptive elastic net regression to predict SCFs from EEG in a sample of 131 participants. The model was fit using within-subject averaged response-locked EEG activity at each electrode and time point within an epoch surrounding the response. We found that higher amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) were related to fewer SCFs. This suggests that lower error-related activity may relate to lower recruitment of interventive self-control in daily life. Altered cognitive control processes, like PM, have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for various mental disorders. Understanding how alterations in PM relate to regulatory control might therefore aid in delineating how these alterations contribute to different psychopathologies.",2020,2021/01/27,Front Hum Neurosci,14,,614979,33584226.0,10.3389/fnhum.2020.614979,,#42,Overmeyer 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Centralized gaze as an adaptive component of defensive states in humans,"Merscher, A. S.; Tovote, P.; Pauli, P.; Gamer, M.","Adequate defensive responding is crucial for mental health but scientifically not well understood. Specifically, it seems difficult to dissociate defense and approach states based on autonomic response patterns. We thus explored the robustness and threat-specificity of recently described oculomotor dynamics upon threat in anticipation of either threatening or rewarding stimuli in humans. While visually exploring naturalistic images, participants (50 per experiment) expected an inevitable, no, or avoidable shock (Experiment 1) or a guaranteed, no, or achievable reward (Experiment 2) that could be averted or gained by a quick behavioural response. We observed reduced heart rate (bradycardia), increased skin conductance, pupil dilation and globally centralized gaze when shocks were inevitable but, more pronouncedly, when they were avoidable. Reward trials were not associated with globally narrowed visual exploration, but autonomic responses resembled characteristics of the threat condition. While bradycardia and concomitant sympathetic activation reflect not only threat-related but also action-preparatory states independent of valence, global centralization of gaze seems a robust phenomenon during the anticipation of avoidable threat. Thus, instead of relying on single readouts, translational research in animals and humans should consider the multi-dimensionality of states in aversive and rewarding contexts, especially when investigating ambivalent, conflicting situations.",2022,May 25,Proc Biol Sci,289,1975,20220405,35582796.0,10.1098/rspb.2022.0405,,#43,Merscher 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The Limbic System in Youth Depression: Brain Structural and Functional Alterations in Adolescent In-patients with Severe Depression,"Redlich, R.; Opel, N.; Burger, C.; Dohm, K.; Grotegerd, D.; Forster, K.; Zaremba, D.; Meinert, S.; Repple, J.; Enneking, V.; Leehr, E.; Bohnlein, J.; Winters, L.; Frobose, N.; Thrun, S.; Emtmann, J.; Heindel, W.; Kugel, H.; Arolt, V.; Romer, G.; Postert, C.; Dannlowski, U.","Adolescent-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an increased risk of recurrent depressive episodes, suicidal behaviors, and psychiatric morbidity throughout the lifespan. The objective of the present study was to investigate brain structural and functional changes in adolescent patients with MDD. Furthermore, we aimed to clarify the influence of early-life stress on brain function and structure. The study investigated adolescent patients with severe MDD (n=20, mean age=16.0, range=15-18 years) and a control sample of matched healthy adolescents (n=21, mean age=16.6, range=15-18 years). Functional MRI data were obtained using a face-matching paradigm to investigate emotion processing. Structural MRI data were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). In line with previous studies on adult MDD, adolescent patients showed elevated amygdala activity to negative and reduced amygdala activity to positive emotional stimuli. Furthermore, MDD patients showed smaller hippocampal volumes compared to healthy adolescents. Higher levels of childhood maltreatment were associated with smaller hippocampal volumes in both depressed patients and healthy controls, whereby no associations between amygdala reactivity and childhood maltreatment were found. Our results suggest that hippocampal alterations in youth MDD patients may at least partly be traced back to higher occurrence of early-life adverse experiences. Regarding the strong morphometric impact of childhood maltreatment and its distinctly elevated prevalence in MDD populations, this study provides an alternative explanation for frequently observed limbic structural abnormalities in depressed patients.",2018,Feb,Neuropsychopharmacology,43,3,546-554,29039414.0,10.1038/npp.2017.246,,#44,Redlich 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Facial emotion recognition in adolescents with nonsuicidal self-injury,"In-Albon, T.; Ruf, C.; Schmid, M.","Adolescents with nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) have been described as having considerable impairment in social interactions, and social difficulties are often a trigger for NSSI. However, little is known about how adolescents with NSSI disorder process facial expressions of emotion. We investigated the recognition of facial expressions of emotion in 47 adolescents with NSSI disorder, 28 clinical controls without NSSI, and 51 nonclinical controls. Following a neutral or a sad mood induction, participants were presented with a dynamic facial expression that slowly changed from neutral to full-intensity happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear or neutral (closed/open mouth). Recognition of facial expressions was measured by the intensity of the expression at which participants could accurately identify the facial expression. No group differences in the recognition of facial expressions were found. All groups required comparable stages of emotional expressivity to correctly recognize emotions, and there were no significant differences in accuracy. Results indicate no mood effect on recognition or accuracy. Valence and arousal ratings of stimuli indicated that compared to the nonclinical control group but not to clinical controls, the adolescents with NSSI disorder rated the stimuli as significantly more unpleasant and arousing.",2015,Aug 30,Psychiatry Res,228,3,332-9,26163730.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2015.05.089,,#45,In-Albon 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Klitzing K; Weschenfelder-Stachwitz, H.; Romer, G.; Moller, B.","Adopting a systems approach, parental cancer has its impact on patients, spouses, and dependent children. The purpose of the current study was to examine family functioning dependent on parental disease stage and on family member perspective in families of cancer patients with adolescent children. The cross-sectional study was conducted within a German multisite research project of families before their first child-centered counseling encounter. The sample comprised individuals nested within N = 169 families. Analyses performed included analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and intraclass correlation. Open answers were analyzed following quantitative content analysis procedures. Between 15% and 36% of family members reported dysfunctional general functioning scores. Parents indicated more dysfunctional scores on the Family Assessment Device scale Roles, and adolescents more dysfunctional Communication scores. Regarding assessment of family functioning, there was higher agreement in families with parents in a palliative situation. For adolescents with parents in palliation, incidents because of the disease tend to become more dominant, and spending time with the family tends to become even more important. As our study pointed out, parental cancer, and especially parental palliative disease, is associated with both perceived critical and positive aspects in family functioning. Supporting families in these concerns as well as encouraging perceptions of positive aspects are important components of psycho-oncological interventions for families with dependent children.",2013,Jun,Fam Syst Health,31,2,181-193,23795629.0,10.1037/a0032274,,#46,Kuhne 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Age dependent changes of distractibility and reorienting of attention revisited: an event-related potential study,"Berti, S.; Grunwald, M.; Schroger, E.","Adults of three age groups (18-27, 39-45, and 59-66 years) performed an auditory duration discrimination task with short (200 ms) or long (400 ms) sinusoidal tones. Performance was highly accurate and reaction times were on the same level in all groups, indicating no differences in auditory duration processing. Task irrelevant rare changes of the frequency of the stimuli were introduced to check whether the subjects, firstly, were distracted by changes in the environment while focusing on the task relevant information (indicated by prolonged responses), and, secondly, could re-focus on the relevant task after distraction. The results show that a distraction effect is present in all groups. Importantly, the 59-66 years group showed a behavioral distraction effect nearly twice as high as the other groups. The event-related brain potentials (ERPs) show mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a, and reorienting negativity (RON) elicited by deviants which are present in all groups. Aging effects on these ERP components were observable in all three components but a revealed a weak significant effect for the MMN only. Taken together, the behavioral and ERP results suggest that the function of balancing the processing of task irrelevant changes in the stimulation while focusing on task relevant information is effective during adulthood until the 7th decade of life.",2013,Jan 23,Brain Res,1491,,156-66,23159833.0,10.1016/j.brainres.2012.11.009,,#47,Berti 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Relating between the voice and voice-hearer: Validation of a revised version of the Voice And You,"Schlier, B.; Strauss, C.; Lincoln, T.

In this study, we aim to validate and revise the Voice And You (VAY), one of the first measures that was developed to assess distressing relationships with voices. Data was pooled from 5 sources (n = 192) including the VAY and an interview-based assessment of voice-hearing. The VAY was subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and revised based on item loadings. Criterion validity was assessed by correlating the VAY with measures of voice-related distress and other voice characteristics from the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS) interview. For the original VAY, we found sufficient model fit for the voice-to-hearer relating factors (voice dominance and intrusiveness), but not for the hearer-to-voice relating factors (hearer dependence and distance). A revised version showed sufficient overall model-fit while retaining the level of criterion validity of the original scale. Thus, we derived a revised, valid, and parsimonious 14 item VAY (VAY-R) that provides a feasible tool to assess the interrelating between hearer and voice. Nevertheless, hearer-to-voice relating needs a more differentiated assessment of hearer relating styles that includes the possibility of actively engaging with the voice.",2020,Oct,Schizophr Res,224,,45-50,33213946.0,10.1016/j.schres.2020.10.010,,#48,Schlier 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
How to choose the size of facial areas of interest in interactive eye tracking,"Vehlen, A.; Standard, W.; Domes, G.","Advances in eye tracking technology have enabled the development of interactive experimental setups to study social attention. Since these setups differ substantially from the eye tracker manufacturer's test conditions, validation is essential with regard to the quality of gaze data and other factors potentially threatening the validity of this signal. In this study, we evaluated the impact of accuracy and areas of interest (AOIs) size on the classification of simulated gaze (fixation) data. We defined AOIs of different sizes using the Limited-Radius Voronoi-Tessellation (LRVT) method, and simulated gaze data for facial target points with varying accuracy. As hypothesized, we found that accuracy and AOI size had strong effects on gaze classification. In addition, these effects were not independent and differed in falsely classified gaze inside AOIs (Type I errors; false alarms) and falsely classified gaze outside the predefined AOIs (Type II errors; misses). Our results indicate that smaller AOIs generally minimize false classifications as long as accuracy is good enough. For studies with lower accuracy, Type II errors can still be compensated to some extent by using larger AOIs, but at the cost of more probable Type I errors. Proper estimation of accuracy is therefore essential for making informed decisions regarding the size of AOIs in eye tracking research.",2022,2022/02/04,PLOS ONE,17,2,e0263594,35120188.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0263594,,#49,Vehlen 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Dispositional cognitive reappraisal modulates the neural correlates of fear acquisition and extinction,"Hermann, A.; Keck, T.; Stark, R.","Adverse learning experiences play a significant role in the etiology of anxiety disorders. However, not all individuals experiencing negative events develop heightened anxiety. This is possibly due to individual differences in the regulation of negative emotions associated with these negative events. Cognitive reappraisal is defined as reinterpreting an emotion-eliciting situation in a way that changes its emotional impact. A more frequent use of cognitive reappraisal in daily life has been shown to be more adaptive. However, no study to date examined the association of dispositional cognitive reappraisal with emotional learning, in order to elucidate individual differences in negative emotional responses towards aversive events. The goal of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to investigate the association of dispositional cognitive reappraisal with subjective, electrodermal and neural correlates of fear acquisition and extinction. Data of 41 healthy individuals, who participated in a socially relevant differential conditioning paradigm (acquisition and extinction learning: day 1, extinction recall: day 2), were acquired. Dispositional cognitive reappraisal was negatively associated with right insula, and hippocampus activation during acquisition. Furthermore, the reduction of self-reported conditioned fear during extinction learning as well as reduced insula and enhanced rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation during extinction learning was related to cognitive reappraisal. In addition, reduced recovery of conditioned arousal, reduced anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation and enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation during extinction recall was observed in individuals with higher cognitive reappraisal scores. The results indicate that dispositional cognitive reappraisal modulates subjective and neural correlates of fear conditioning, probably leading to reduced acquisition and stronger extinction learning and recall. These results point to the important role of dispositional cognitive reappraisal in the development and modification of conditioned emotional responses and might further improve our understanding of anxiety disorders.",2014,Sep,Neurobiol Learn Mem,113,,115-24,24713451.0,10.1016/j.nlm.2014.03.008,,#50,Hermann 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

The sample consisted of outpatients (N = 101) suffering from panic disorder, specific phobia, or agoraphobia who completed the Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ) before and after therapy, as well as at a 6-month follow-up assessment. Multivariate analyses of variance were conducted to test for changes due to therapy. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to test for the impact of affective styles on remission from anxiety disorders, and hierarchical regression analyses were calculated to examine the association between changes in affective styles and symptom reduction. Results indicated significant increases on the ASQ subscales adjusting and tolerating after therapy. Concealing did not decrease significantly after therapy.

Affective touch awareness in mental health and disease relates to autistic traits - An explorative neurophysiological investigation,"Croy, I.; Geide, H.; Paulus, M.; Weidner, K.; Olausson, H.","Affective touch is important for social interaction within families and groups and there is evidence that unmyelinated C tactile fibers are involved in this process. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders show alterations in the perception and processing of affective touch. sThus, we hypothesized that affective touch awareness based on C tactile fiber activation is impaired in individuals with high levels of autistic trait. The pleasantness perception of optimal and suboptimal C tactile stimuli was tested in an explorative study in 70 patients recruited from an outpatient psychotherapy clinic and 69 healthy comparison subjects. All participants completed questionnaires about autistic traits, depressive symptomatology, childhood maltreatment, and about the daily amount of touch. Relative to comparison subjects, patients reported engaging in touch less frequently in daily life and rated touch less pleasant. Reduced valence ratings of touch were explained by childhood maltreatment but not by any particular disorder or depression severity. Among all tested variables, the affective touch awareness correlated with autistic traits only - in patients as well as in comparison subjects. Taken together, individuals with mental health issues have a lower baseline of expression and reception of affective touch.

Gentle touch perception: From early childhood to adolescence,"Croy, I.; Sehlstedt, I.; Wasling, H. B.; Ackerley, R.; Olausson, H.","Affective touch plays an important role in children's social interaction and is involved in shaping the development of the social brain. The positive affective component of touch is thought to be conveyed via a group of unmyelinated, low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents, known as C-tactile fibers that are optimally activated by gentle, slow, stroking touch. Touch targeting these C-tactile fibers has been shown to decrease the heart rate in infants. The current study investigated the relationship between age and psychophysical ratings in response to affective touch. A total of n=43 participants (early childhood: aged 5-8 years, 9 girls, 12 boys; late childhood: aged 9-12 years, 12 girls, 10 boys) were presented with C-tactile optimal and sub-optimal stroking velocities and rated touch pleasantness on an affective pictorial scale. For both age groups, we found that children preferred C-tactile-targeted stimulation. A comparison with previously published data showed that the children's preference for C-tactile-targeted stimulation was similar to those obtained in adolescents and adults. We speculate that the effect of C-tactile-targeted touch, which is linked with pleasantness, shapes the children's preference for C-tactile over non-C-tactile-targeted stimulation, and that C-tactile afferent stimulation is important for social development.",2019,Feb,Dev Cogn Neurosci,35,,81-86,28927641.0,10.1016/j.dcn.2017.07.009,,#53,Croy 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Here, we investigated whether the frequency and severity of intrusions can be reduced by the provision of placebo. After the (online) exposure to the trauma-film paradigm, healthy participants (N = 112) received deceptive placebo (DP), open-label placebo (OLP), or no treatment. In the DP group, participants were led to believe to receive a dopamine-modulating drug, which was supposed to disrupt the consolidation of traumatic memories, although they in fact received the same placebo tablets as the OLP group for one week. The results show that the groups did not differ in the frequency of intrusive memories after one week. However, participants receiving OLP reported a significantly reduced intensity of intrusions as compared to DP. Across groups, negative expectations about the intensity and controllability of intrusions were associated with a higher frequency of intrusions, higher distress, higher burden, and more negative appraisal. The results suggest that expectations play an important role in the emergence of intrusive memories and that some of the disabling aspects of intrusive memories can be reduced by placebo.

Don't Make Me Angry: Frustration-Induced Anger and Its Link to Aggression in Women With Borderline Personality Disorder,"Bertsch, K.; Back, S.; Flechsenhar, A.; Neukel, C.; Krauch, M.; Spiess, K.; Panizza, A.; Herpertz, S. C.","Aggression is a prominent interpersonal dysfunction of individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). In BPD aggression is predominantly reactive in nature, often triggered by frustration, provocation, or social threat and is associated with intense anger and an inability to regulate this strong, negative emotion. Building on previous research, we were interested in investigating negative emotionality in general and anger in particular in women with BPD before and after frustration induction. To achieve this, 60 medication-free women with BPD and 32 healthy women rated the intensity of negative emotions (angry, frustrated, upset, embarrassed, nervous) before and after performing a Titrated Mirror Tracing Task, which reliably induces frustration and distress. As expected, women with BPD reported significantly greater intensity of negative emotions before and after frustration than healthy women. Specifically, they showed a significantly stronger frustration-induced increase in anger, while other negative emotions remained unaffected by frustration induction. This anger increase was significantly related to aggressive behavior reported in the 2 weeks prior to the experiment, as well as to the level of frustration experienced in the experiment itself, but not with emotion dysregulation. The current data confirm the important role of frustration-induced anger independent of emotion dysregulation in BPD, in particular with regard to aggression, a prominent interpersonal dysfunction of this disorder.

Nightmare distress revisited: Cognitive appraisal of nightmares according to Lazarus' transactional model of stress,"Gieselmann, A.; Elberich, N.; Mathes, J.; Pietrowsky, R.","Aim of the current research was to newly conceptualize nightmare distress. The special focus was on the appraisal of nightmare distress while applying a theory-driven approach based on Lazarus' transactional model of stress. It was argued that individuals feel the more distressed the more they feel threatened and harmed by their nightmares (primary appraisal according to Lazarus) and the more they lack of adequate coping skills to deal with the stressor (secondary appraisal). Based on these assumptions, the questionnaire of Cognitive Appraisal of Nightmares (CAN) was challenged empirically in two studies of patients who have experienced distressing nightmares using explorative and confirmative factor analyses (N = 504 and N = 402). Items and scales showed good psychometric properties and plausible correlations. The CAN sum score was more distinct from nightmare frequency than the frequently used Nightmare Distress Questionnaire (NDQ), underpinning that frequency and distress are both different approaches to what patients suffer from. The NDQ was particularly associated with acted out behaviors after a nightmare, while the CAN was particularly associated with physiological and emotional consequences of a nightmare. In order to obtain a multifactorial and theory-driven picture about how individuals appraise their nightmares, the CAN may be convenient.",2020,Sep,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,68,,101517,31884305.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2019.101517,,#58,Gieselmann 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Acoustic evoked potentials were recorded using standardised methodology. For the event-related potentials, positive, negative and neutral pictures were presented and time intervals of 250-450, 450-650 and 650-850 msec evaluated. Hypotheses were tested with repeated-measures analyses of variance. RESULTS: In the frontal region, children with NE showed more intense responses to positive and negative pictures than controls measured with event-related potentials. Viewing positive pictures, children with NE + ADHD differed from children with ADHD in the central and parietal and for all types of stimuli in the parietal region.

However, little is known about country-specific differences in HRQoL and in treatment-associated HRQoL improvement. The present work sought to examine those questions. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data from the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study in Elderly (CIBIS-ELD) trial, in which patients from central and south-eastern Europe completed the HRQoL questionnaire SF-36 at baseline and the end of a 12-week beta-blocker up-titration (follow-up). 416 patients from Serbia (mean age 72.21 years, 69% NYHA-class I-II, 27.4% women) and 114 from Germany (mean age 73.64 years, 78.9% NYHA-class I-II, 47.4% women) were included.

Process-symptom-bridges in psychotherapy: An idiographic network approach,"Kaiser, T.; Laireiter, A. R.","AIM: real-time monitoring of psychotherapeutic processes was recently described as a promising, new way of tracking periods of change in ongoing treatments. This approach generates complex, multivariate datasets that have to be presented in an intuitive way for clinicians to aid their clinical decision-making. Using network modeling and new approaches in centrality analyses, we examine ""bridge nodes"" between symptom stress and aspects of the psychotherapeutic process between therapy session (intersession processes, ISP). Method:we recorded intersession processes as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms using daily questionnaires in ten cases. Regularized, thresholded intraindividual dynamic networks were estimated. We applied bridge centrality analysis to identify individual bridges between psychotherapeutic processes and symptoms in the resulting models. Case-wise interpretations of bridge centrality values are offered. RESULTS: bridge centrality analysis revealed individual bridge nodes between intersession processes and symptom severity. Strength and direction of bridges varied substantially across individuals. CONCLUSION: given current methodological challenges, idiographic network studies are feasible and offer important insights for psychotherapy process research. In this case, we demonstrated how patients deal with periods of increased symptom stress. In this case we have described how patients deal with their therapy under increased symptom load. Bridges between psychotherapeutic processes and symptom stress are a promising target for monitoring systems based on ISP. Future studies should examine the clinical utility of network-based monitoring and feedback in ongoing therapies. In the near future, process feedback systems based on idiographic models could serve clinicians to improve treatments.",2018,2018/12/27,J Pers Oriented Res,4,2,49-62,33569133.0,10.17505/jpor.2018.06,,#64,Kaiser 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Physical activity, mental and physical health during the Covid-19 outbreak: longitudinal predictors of suicide ideation in Germany","Brailovskaia, J.; Truskauskaite-Kuneviciene, I.; Kazlauskas, E.; Gelezelyte, O.; Teismann, T.; Margraf, J.","AIM: Suicide ideation has increased since the outbreak of Covid-19 in many countries. The present longitudinal study investigated potential predictors of suicide ideation. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Data of 406 participants from Germany (age M = 27.69, SD = 6.88) were assessed via online surveys in spring 2020 (baseline, BL) and in spring 2021 (follow-up, FU). RESULTS: The current results reveal a significant increase in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress between 2020 and 2021. Positive mental health (PMH), sense of control, and physical health significantly decreased. Depression symptoms (BL), PMH (BL), and consciously enhanced physical activity since the pandemic outbreak (FU) significantly predicted 12-month suicide ideation (FU). In a moderated mediation analysis, the positive relationship between depression and suicide ideation was significantly mediated by PMH. Consciously enhanced physical activity significantly moderated the negative association between PMH and suicide ideation. CONCLUSION: The context of Covid-19 could negatively impact mental health and physical health. This might increase the risk for suicide ideation. However, PMH and physical activity might serve as protective factors. The protective effect of physical activity could be especially important in people with high depression symptoms and low PMH, such as clinical patients. Potential ways of how PMH and physical activity could be enhanced in the Covid-19 context to prevent suicide ideation are discussed.",2022,Mar 25,Z Gesundh Wiss,,,1-11,35369671.0,10.1007/s10389-022-01708-0,,#65,Brailovskaia 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
[The Pathological Buying Screener: Validation in a Clinical Sample],"Muller, A.; Trotzke, P.; Laskowski, N. M.; Brederecke, J.; Georgiadou, E.; Tahmassebi, N.; Hillemacher, T.; de Zwaan, M.; Brand, M.","AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the 13-item Pathological Buying Screener (PBS, [1]) in a clinical sample. METHOD: The PBS was administered to a total sample of 413 treatment-seeking patients (buying-shopping disorder n=151, gambling disorder n=59, alcohol dependency n=60, other mental disorders [anxiety, depressive, eating, somatoform disorders] n=143). Factor structure was tested in the total sample using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), reliability was determined by means of Cronbach's alpha. Group comparisons were used to determine to which degree the PBS discriminates between patients with BSD and other clinical groups. The BSD-group completed a battery of other measures to explore convergent and divergent validity. A subgroup (n=29) answered the PBS before and after psychotherapy to investigate sensitivity to change. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with PBS data of patients with buying-shopping disorder and those from a previous community sample 1 was performed to define a cut-off point for buying-shopping disorder. RESULTS: The CFA showed a good model fit for both a one-factor and a two-factor structure with the subscales ""loss of control/consequences"" (10 items) and ""excessive buying behavior"" (3 items). The subscales were highly intercorrelated (r=0.92). A hierarchical regression analysis with another BSD measure as dependent variable did not indicate an own incremental validity of the subscale ""excessive buying behavior"". Good convergent, divergent and discriminative capacity was obtained for the PBS total score. At its recommended cut-off point of >/=29 the PBS has a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 94.7%.

Experimental longitudinal evidence for causal role of social media use and physical activity in COVID-19 burden and mental health,"Brailovskaia, J.; Swarlik, V. J.; Grethe, G. A.; Schillack, H.; Margraf, J.","AIM: The COVID-19 outbreak has severely impacted people's mental health. The present experimental study investigated how to reduce this negative effect by a combination of two interventions. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Participants (N (total) = 642) were users of social media in Germany. For two weeks, the social media group (N = 162) reduced its social media use (SMU) by 30 minutes daily, the physical activity group (N = 161) increased its physical activity by 30 minutes daily, the combination group (N = 159) followed both instructions, and the control group (N = 160) did not get specific instructions. Online surveys assessed variables of SMU, physical activity, mental health, COVID-19 burden, and lifestyle at six measurement time points up to six months after the intervention. RESULTS: In the experimental groups, (addictive) SMU, depression symptoms, and COVID-19 burden decreased, while physical activity, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness increased. All effects were stronger and more stable in the combination group in the longer-term. Smoking behavior decreased in the social media group only. CONCLUSION: Thus, the conscious combination of less SMU and more physical activity leads causally to more psychological resilience against negative pandemic impacts and to higher levels of mental health over six months. Prevention programs could improve their effectiveness by integrating the time- and cost-efficient interventions - separately or in combination.

The Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences measures nine clusters of psychosis-like experiences: A validation of the German version of the CAPE,"Schlier, B.; Jaya, E. S.; Moritz, S.; Lincoln, T. M.","AIM: This study examined the factorial and criterion validity of the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE). We compared the validity of the original three-dimensional model and a recently proposed multidimensional model, in which positive symptoms are subdivided into the subfactors hallucinations, bizarre experiences, paranoia, grandiosity and magical thinking and negative symptoms are subdivided into social withdrawal, affective flattening and avolition. METHODS: Eleven community (n=934) and three patient samples (n=112) were combined and the proposed models were tested using confirmatory factor analysis. Criterion validity was calculated based on self-report measures for depression and paranoia as well as observer-based ratings for positive and negative symptoms. RESULTS: The multidimensional model showed better relative quality (AIC, BIC) than the original three-dimensional model of the CAPE, but both models showed acceptable absolute model-fit (RMSEA, SRMR). The criterion validity was good for the positive symptom scales and negative symptom subfactors social withdrawal and affective flattening. CONCLUSION: Factorial validity was found for the three-dimensional and multidimensional model for the CAPE. The multidimensional model, however, shows better comparative fit and promising results in regard to criterion validity.

Assessing Diabetes Self-Management with the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ) Can Help Analyse Behavioural Problems Related to Reduced Glycaemic Control,"Schmitt, A.; Reimer, A.; Hermanns, N.; Huber, J.; Ehrmann, D.; Schall, S.; Kulzer, B.","AIM: To appraise the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ)'s measurement of diabetes self-management as a statistical predictor of glycaemic control relative to the widely used SDSCA. METHODS: 248 patients with type 1 diabetes and 182 patients with type 2 diabetes were cross-sectionally assessed using the two self-report measures of diabetes self-management DSMQ and SDSCA; the scales were used as competing predictors of HbA1c. We developed a structural equation model of self-management as measured by the DSMQ and analysed the amount of variation explained in HbA1c; an analogue model was developed for the SDSCA. RESULTS: The structural equation models of self-management and glycaemic control showed very good fit to the data. The DSMQ's measurement of self-management showed associations with HbA1c of -0.53 for type 1 and -0.46 for type 2 diabetes (both P < 0.001), explaining 21% and 28% of variation in glycaemic control, respectively. The SDSCA's measurement showed associations with HbA1c of -0.14 (P = 0.030) for type 1 and -0.31 (P = 0.003) for type 2 diabetes, explaining 2% and 10% of glycaemic variation. Predictive power for glycaemic control was significantly higher for the DSMQ (P < 0.001).

Mental Strain and Chronic Stress among University Students with Symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"Gulewitsch, M. D.; Enck, P.; Schwille-Kiuntke, J.; Weimer, K.; Schlarb, A. A.","Aim. To investigate the degree of mental strain and chronic stress in a German community sample of students with IBS-like symptoms. Methods and Materials. Following an internet-based survey about stress, this study recruited 176 German university students (23.45 +/- 2.48 years; 48.3% males) with IBS-like symptoms according to Rome III and 181 students without IBS (23.55 +/- 2.82 years; 50.3% males) and compared them regarding current mental strain (SCL-90-R) and the extend of chronic stress. Beyond this, IBS subtypes, IBS severity, and health care utilization were assessed. Results. Students fulfilling IBS criteria showed significantly elevated values of mental strain and chronic stress. Nearly 40% of the IBS group (versus 20% of the controls) reached a clinically relevant value on the SCL-90-R global severity scale. IBS subtypes did not differ in terms of mental distress or chronic stress. Somatization, anxiety, and the chronic stressors ""work overload,"" ""social tension,"" and ""dissatisfaction with job"" were most closely connected to IBS symptom severity.

"Working memory for pitch, timbre, and words","Schulze, K.; Tillmann, B.","Aiming to further our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of auditory working memory (WM), the present study compared performance for three auditory materials (words, tones, timbres). In a forward recognition task (Experiment 1) participants indicated whether the order of the items in the second sequence was the same as in the first sequence. In a backward recognition task (Experiment 2) participants indicated whether the items of the second sequence were played in the correct backward order. In Experiment 3 participants performed an articulatory suppression task during the retention delay of the backward task. To investigate potential length effects the number of items per sequence was manipulated. Overall findings underline the benefit of a cross-material experimental approach and suggest that human auditory WM is not a unitary system.

"Is it a Case of ""Work-Anxiety"" When Patients Report Bad Workplace Characteristics and Low Work Ability?","Muschalla, B.","Aims Work-anxiety may produce overly negative views of the workplace that impair provider efforts to assess work ability from patient self-report. This study explores the empirical relationships between patient-reported workplace characteristics, work-anxiety, and subjective and objective work ability measures. Methods 125 patients in medical rehabilitation before vocational reintegration were interviewed concerning their vocational situation, and filled in a questionnaire on work-anxiety, subjective mental work ability and perceived workplace characteristics. Treating physicians gave independent socio-medical judgments concerning the patients' work ability and impairment, and need for supportive means for vocational reintegration. Results Patients with high work-anxiety reported more negative workplace characteristics. Low judgments of work ability were correlated with problematic workplace characteristics. When controlled for work-anxiety, subjective work ability remained related only with social workplace characteristics and with work achievement demands, but independent from situational or task characteristics. Sick leave duration and physicians' judgment of work ability were not significantly related to patient-reported workplace characteristics. Conclusions In socio-medical work ability assessments, patients with high work-anxiety may over-report negative workplace characteristics that can confound provider estimates of work ability.

Elimination disorders in persons with Prader-Willi and Fragile-X syndromes,"Equit, M.; Piro-Hussong, A.; Niemczyk, J.; Curfs, L.; von Gontard, A.","AIMS: Elimination disorders are common in typically developing children. Only few studies have addressed elimination disorders in persons with intellectual disability (ID)-and even fewer studies in those with specific syndromes. The aim of the study was to investigate the rates of elimination disorders and behavioral symptoms in persons with Prader-Willi (PWS) and Fragile-X syndromes (FXS) in a large sample. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-seven persons with PWS or FXS were recruited through parent self-help groups. A questionnaire regarding elimination symptoms, as well as the child behavior checklist (CBCL)/young adult behavior checklist (YABCL) were filled out by parents or caregivers. RESULTS: The sample included 191 persons with PWS (54.5% male) with a mean age of 20.0 years and 166 persons with FXS (92.2% male) with a mean age of 15.4 years. Persons with FXS were significantly more often affected by elimination disorders. 29.3% of persons with PWS and 48.8% of persons with FXS had at least one elimination disorder. Persons with FXS also had more often DUI (29.5% vs. 12.0%) and FI (28.9% vs. 12.6%). Rates of NE were similar in both groups (22.0% in PWS vs. 28.9% in FXS). Young adults with PWS had more behavioral symptoms in the clinical range (70.8% vs. 48.3%). Incontinence and behavioral symptoms were significantly associated in persons with FXS.

Reduction of depressive symptoms predicts improved glycaemic control: Secondary results from the DIAMOS study,"Schmitt, A.; Reimer, A.; Ehrmann, D.; Kulzer, B.; Haak, T.; Hermanns, N.","AIMS: Evidence from randomised trials analysing effects of depression treatment on glycaemic control in group comparisons is inconsistent. The aim of this study was to test if the reduction of depressive symptoms would explain improved glycaemic control irrespective of treatment groups. METHODS: The DIAMOS study tested effects of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) versus usual care on depressive symptoms in a 12-month prospective trial; HbA(1c) was a secondary outcome. Since the results suggested superiority of CBT for improving depressive symptoms, but not HbA(1c), we conducted this secondary analysis to test if reduction of depressive symptoms could explain improved glycaemic control when assessed irrespective of treatment group affiliation. Reduction of depressive symptoms was assessed using baseline-to-follow-up changes in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). We used multiple regression analyses, adjusting for baseline HbA(1c) and depression, group affiliation and covariates, to assess associations between reduction of depressive symptoms and follow-up HbA(1c). RESULTS: 181 participants provided eligible data. Depressive symptoms decreased between baseline and follow-up by averagely -5.1+/-11.8 CES-D points. Greater reduction of depressive symptoms predicted greater improvement of HbA(1c) at follow-up, while adjusting for baseline HbA(1c) and covariates (Beta=-0.24, P=0.004). Additionally, patients with greater reduction of depressive symptoms were more likely to reach in-target HbA(1c) (<7.5%) at follow-up (adjusted OR=1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, P=0.023).

A Self-Report Measure of Diabetes Self-Management for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: The Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire-Revised (DSMQ-R) - Clinimetric Evidence From Five Studies,"Schmitt, A.; Kulzer, B.; Ehrmann, D.; Haak, T.; Hermanns, N.","AIMS: Measurement tools to evaluate self-management behavior are useful for diabetes research and clinical practice. The Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ) was introduced in 2013 and has become a widely used tool. This article presents a revised and updated version, DSMQ-R, and evaluates its properties in assessing self-management practices in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: The DSMQ-R is a multidimensional questionnaire with 27 items regarding essential self-management practices for T1D and T2D (including diabetes-adjusted eating, glucose testing/monitoring, medication taking, physical activity and cooperation with the diabetes team). For the revised form, the original items were partially amended and the wording was updated; eleven items were newly added. The tool was applied as part of health-related surveys in five clinical studies (two cross-sectional, three prospective) including a total of 1,447 people with T1D and T2D. Using this data base, clinimetric properties were rigorously tested. RESULTS: The analyses showed high internal and retest reliability coefficients for the total scale and moderate to high coefficients for the subscales. Reliability coefficients for scales including the new items were consistently higher. Correlations with convergent criteria and related variables supported validity. Responsiveness was supported by significant short to medium term changes in prospective studies. Significant associations with glycemic outcomes were observed for DSMQ-R-assessed medication taking, glucose monitoring and eating behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results support good clinimetric properties of the DSMQ-R.

While there is evidence for a negative impact of depression, much less is known about stable, personality oriented factors. Aim of the study was to assess the impact of depression and personality functioning on glucose regulation in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Seventy-five adult individuals with a first diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were consecutively recruited in an outpatient medical practice. Plasma glucose (HbA1c) was measured at initial contact, and after three and six months of a standardized disease management program. Depression was assessed by self-report (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-D), levels of personality functioning with the screening version of the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis structure questionnaire (OPD-SQS). RESULTS: Using mixed regression models, OPD-SQS scores were associated with lower baseline levels of HbA1c, but a less steep decline over time. PHQ-D scores were neither associated with intercept nor with slopes of HbA1c.

D.","AIMS: To (1) determine diabetes patients' acceptance of Internet-based interventions (IBIs) for depression, to (2) examine the effectiveness of an acceptance facilitating intervention (AFI) and to (3) explore subgroup specific effects. METHODS: 141 diabetes patients from two inpatient rehabilitation units and one outpatient clinic in Germany were randomly allocated to an intervention (IG) and a no-intervention control group (CG). The IG received an AFI consisting of a personal information session before filling-out a questionnaire on patients' acceptance of IBIs, predictors of acceptance (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and Internet anxiety) as well as sociodemographic, depression-related and diabetes-related variables. The CG filled out the questionnaire immediately. Patients' acceptance of IBIs was measured with a four-item scale (sum-score ranging from 4 to 20). RESULTS: The CG showed a low (50.7%) to medium (40.8%) acceptance with only 8.5% of all diabetes patients reporting a high acceptance of IBIs for depression.

Yet, subgroup analyses yielded a trend for depressed, diabetes-related distressed, female and younger (<59) participants and for those who do not frequently use the Internet to profit from the AFI. CONCLUSION: Diabetes patients show a rather low acceptance toward IBIs for depression.

DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) from a societal and a cost-benefit analysis from the employer's perspective with a 6-month time horizon. SETTING: Open recruitment in the German working population. PARTICIPANTS: Employees (178 males, 256 females, mean age 47 years) consuming at least 14 (women) or 21 (men) standard units of alcohol (SUAs) per week and scoring >/= 8 (men) or 6 (women) on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.

The impact of negative treatment experiences on persistent refusal of antipsychotics,"Lincoln, T.

METHOD: We included 45 participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, of which 20 had refused antipsychotic medication for at least three months and assessed reasons for taking or not taking medication, labeling condition as mental disorder (""insight""), experiences with the previous treatments, symptoms and symptom distress, positive and negative consequences and experiences of psychosis, causal beliefs, therapeutic relationships with previous clinicians and attitudes towards medication. RESULTS: Groups did not differ in symptom severity but medication refusers reported significantly less insight, less satisfaction with their most-recent psychiatrist and with previous medication, and more negative beliefs about harmful effects of medication. They also felt less informed about medication. After controlling for insight, the perceived helpfulness of the previous treating psychiatrist (OR=0.30, z=5.58, p=0.018) and of previous medication (OR=0.27, z=6.87, p=0.009) and feeling insufficiently informed about medication (OR=0.53, z=3. 85, p=0.050) significantly predicted medication discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Building rapport with patients with a different view of the nature of their condition and encouraging informed decisions on medication are likely to improve medication adherence.

Alexithymia increases effects of ego-depletion,"Schnabel, K.; Pollatos, O.","Alexithymia is associated with deficiencies to identify, describe and express emotions, paucity of fantasies and an externally oriented cognitive style. The current studies provide evidence that alexithymia is also related to self-regulation processes and exacerbates effects of ego-depletion, a state where self-regulation resources are reduced due to previous acts of self-regulation. In Study 1, ego-depletion effects of a handgrip task on pain tolerance were increased by alexithymia. In Study 2, an emotion suppression task showed stronger effects of ego-depletion on a Stroop task in participants high rather than low in alexithymia, but only after suppression of emotions induced by negative and not positive pictures. The results imply that alexithymia increases susceptibility to ego-depletion effects, that consumption of self-regulatory resources has stronger consequences for people high in alexithymia and that they should experience special support in ways to replenish self-regulation resources.",2022,2022/10/19,Front Psychiatry,13,,970244,36339834.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.970244,,#84,Schnabel 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Polygenic risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) predicts brain response during working memory task in OCD, unaffected relatives, and healthy controls","Heinzel, S.; Kaufmann, C.; Grutzmann, R.; Klawohn, J.; Riesel, A.; Bey, K.; Heilmann-Heimbach, S.; Weinhold, L.; Ramirez, A.; Wagner, M.; Kathmann, N.","Alterations in frontal and parietal neural activations during working memory task performance have been suggested as a candidate endophenotype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in studies involving first-degree relatives. However, the direct link between genetic risk for OCD and neuro-functional alterations during working memory performance has not been investigated to date. Thus, the aim of the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to test the direct association between polygenic risk for OCD and neural activity during the performance of a numeric n-back task with four working memory load conditions in 128 participants, including patients with OCD, unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients, and healthy controls. Behavioral results show a significant performance deficit at high working memory load in both patients with OCD and first-degree relatives (p < 0.05). A whole-brain analysis of the fMRI data indicated decreased neural activity in bilateral inferior parietal lobule and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in both patients and relatives. Most importantly, OCD polygenic risk scores predicted neural activity in orbitofrontal cortex.

Differentiating aversive conditioning in bistable perception: Avoidance of a percept vs. salience of a stimulus,"Wilbertz, G.; Sterzer, P.","Alternating conscious visual perception of bistable stimuli is influenced by several factors. In order to understand the effect of negative valence, we tested the effect of two types of aversive conditioning on dominance durations in binocular rivalry. Participants received either aversive classical conditioning of the stimuli shown alone between rivalry blocks, or aversive percept conditioning of one of the two possible perceptual choices during rivalry. Both groups showed successful aversive conditioning according to skin conductance responses and affective valence ratings. However, while classical conditioning led to an immediate but short-lived increase in dominance durations of the conditioned stimulus, percept conditioning yielded no significant immediate effect but tended to decrease durations of the conditioned percept during extinction. These results show dissociable effects of value learning on perceptual inference in situations of perceptual conflict, depending on whether learning relates to the decision between conflicting perceptual choices or the sensory stimuli per se.",2018,May,Conscious Cogn,61,,38-48,29649652.0,10.1016/j.concog.2018.03.010,,#86,Wilbertz 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Increased salivation to mirror exposure in women with binge eating disorder,"Naumann, E.; Trentowska, M.; Svaldi, J.","Although body image disturbances are not a diagnostic criterion of the binge eating disorder (BED), intervention studies yield evidence of its importance in the maintenance of the disorder. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to experimentally test the influence of body-related schemata in the occurrence of appetite in individuals with BED. After collecting baseline saliva, women with BED and weight matched controls (CG) were either given a food exposure (FE) or mirror exposure (ME), while participants' salivary reaction was assessed once more. In addition, participants repeatedly rated their actual desire to binge (DTB) and emotions. Main results reveal a significant salivation and DTB increase in the FE compared to the baseline condition in both groups.

Neural correlates of body image processing in binge eating disorder,"Press, S. A.; Biehl, S. C.; Vatheuer, C. C.; Domes, G.; Svaldi, J.","Although body image disturbances play a central role in the development, maintenance and relapse of binge eating disorder (BED), studies investigating the neural basis underlying body processing in BED are still missing. To address this gap, we conducted a preregistered (German Clinical Trials Register [Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien; DRKS], Registration DRKS00008107) combined functional magnetic resonance (fMRI)/eye tracking study in which 38 women with BED and 22 healthy controls weight-matched for overall equivalence processed images of their own bodies, an unfamiliar weight-matched body, and visually matched nonbody control stimuli while performing a one-back task. Women with BED responded with higher left fusiform body area (FBA) activity than controls during body image processing. Despite higher levels of self-reported body dissatisfaction, women with BED did not show overactivation in emotion-processing areas in response to their own body. The eye-tracking results indicated that visual attention toward the presented stimuli was associated with increased activity in the extrastriate body area (EBA) and FBA across groups. Our results thus provide evidence for an aberrant neural processing of body images in BED and highlight the importance of controlling for visual attention in future studies assessing neuronal body processing.

Successful smoking cessation is associated with prefrontal cortical function during a Stroop task: A preliminary study,"Kronke, K. M.; Wolff, M.; Benz, A.; Goschke, T.","Although many smokers try to quit, relatively few are successful in their attempts. Here we investigated whether the ability to quit smoking is related to behavioral and neural measures of cognitive control. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study with a counting Stroop task was used to measure cognitive control in ex-smokers (N=10) who had successfully quit smoking and smokers (N=10) who continuously failed to quit smoking. Behavioral results showed a significant Stroop effect in ex-smokers and smokers. Ex-smokers exhibited less Stroop interference, indicating superior cognitive control compared with smokers. Furthermore, when incongruent trials were contrasted with congruent trials, ex-smokers showed stronger BOLD activity than smokers in the right superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex. Although the present study does not permit us to draw strong conclusions regarding causality, the results suggest that successful smoking cessation may be mediated by superior cognitive control.",2015,Oct 30,Psychiatry Res,234,1,52-6,26321462.0,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.08.005,,#91,Kronke 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Differences in perceptual memory determine generalization patterns,"Zenses, A. K.; Lee, J. C.; Plaisance, V.; Zaman, J.","Although memory of past experiences is crucial for the ability to transfer knowledge to new situations, surprisingly little research has directly investigated the relationship between memory and generalization. The present study sought to investigate how the perceptual memory of a trained stimulus influences generalization to similar stimuli. Forty participants underwent a fear conditioning procedure on Day 1, and separate memory recall and generalization tests on Day 2. We focused on two aspects of perceptual memory: namely memory bias (i.e., over- or underestimation of stimulus magnitude) and uncertainty. We found that memory bias predicted the pattern of generalized self-reported (expectancy ratings) and psychophysiological responses (fear-potentiated startle responses). Memory uncertainty was measured in two ways: self-reported uncertainty ratings and variability in stimulus recall. We found that higher levels of self-reported memory uncertainty corresponded with a broader generalization gradient on US expectancy, while greater variability in memory recall was associated with a broader generalization gradient on fear-potentiated startle responses. Taken together, our findings suggest that memory is an important determinant of generalized behavior and illustrate the need to account for these interindividual differences in perceptual memory when examining the generalization of learned responses.",2021,Jan,Behav Res Ther,136,,103777,33271392.0,10.1016/j.brat.2020.103777,,#92,Zenses 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Towards a mechanistic understanding of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) using an RCT neuroimaging approach: Effects on regulating own stress in social and non-social situations,"Guendelman, S.; Bayer, M.; Prehn, K.; Dziobek, I.","Although much research has shown that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can reduce psychological stress, it is less clear if effects generalize to everyday social situations, which range among the largest stress triggers. Furthermore, mechanisms of MBIs have not been fully established. Emotion regulation (ER) has been suggested as one key mechanism, yet the role of cognitive reappraisal and acceptance strategies is still under debate. To address these questions, a neuroimaging-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed (n=68), comparing mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) with a reading/listening intervention (READ), using a novel dyadic paradigm for self and other emotion regulation under stress as primary outcome on behavior and brain levels and established empathy measures (clinicatrials.gov NCT03035669). Compared to READ, MBSR led to self-reported stress reduction through both cognitive reappraisal and acceptance only when regulating self and not when regulating others' distress. In addition, MBSR led to increased brain activation over time for regulating own (parietal cortex) and others' (precuneus, TPJ) emotions through cognitive reappraisal and acceptance, albeit this effect was also seen for the reading intervention for regulating own stress via reappraisal. Brain changes did not scale with subjective stress reduction and amount of meditation practice. More distant generalization effects of MBSR on socio-emotional functioning (cognitive empathy and compassion) could also not be shown. This study identified both cognitive reappraisal and acceptance as two ER mechanisms of MBSR, but indicates that effects do not extend to social settings.",2022,Jul 1,NeuroImage,254,,119059,35259523.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119059,,#93,Guendelman 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Body-oriented gaze behaviors in men with muscle dysmorphia diagnoses,"Waldorf, M.; Vocks, S.; Dusing, R.; Bauer, A.; Cordes, M.","Although muscle dysmorphia (MD) has been added as a specifier for body dysmorphic disorder in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, experimental research on psychopathological mechanisms is lacking. Because models of eating disorders (EDs) suggest parallels between MD and ED, body-oriented attentional biases, which are prominent in ED models, have been identified as potentially important maintaining factors. Specifically, we predicted the existence of biases toward subjectively negative areas of one's own body and positive areas of a bodybuilder in MD. We tracked gaze behaviors of 24 men with MD diagnoses, 24 weight-training controls, and 24 non-weight-training controls during exposure to pictures of their own body, an average male body, a lean-muscular body, and a hypermuscular body. Moreover, state body image and affect were assessed at baseline and after each stimulus. Partially supporting our hypotheses, men with MD diagnoses and non-weight-training controls, but not weight-training controls, displayed significant biases toward subjectively negative areas of their own body. Only men with MD diagnoses displayed biases toward positive areas of the hypermuscular body and reacted with a large, significant deterioration in state body image and affect. Attentional biases possibly contribute to the negative effects of critical examinations of one's body and of upward comparisons. There seems to be a specific positive bias toward subjectively ideal hypermuscular bodies in MD in conjunction with a negative bias toward oneself. Insofar as this pattern might maintain the severe muscularity dissatisfaction, it should be explicitly targeted by cognitive-behavioral interventions.

We studied 541 inpatients with BPD, who were consecutively admitted for an open-door 3-month DBT inpatient treatment in Berlin, Germany. All participants completed several self-rating measures and participated in clinical interviews. Fourteen percent, who did not complete the full 84 days of assigned treatment, were expelled, mainly due to treatment-disturbing behaviors, or substance abuse or possession. Nearly 19% dropped out of treatment, mostly due to lack of motivation, arguments with others, and poor tolerance of emotional distress. Using non-parametric conditional inference trees, expulsion was associated with anorexia nervosa and alcohol abuse, whereas more than 9 suicide attempts, antisocial personality disorders, and more than 86 weeks in a psychiatric hospital were risk factors for dropout. We discussed measures and interventions that might lead to an adaptation of DBT inpatient programs.

We aimed to clarify whether PTSD patients show dysfunctional responses to positive emotions and whether positive ER is associated with PTSD symptom severity. PTSD patients (N = 59) were compared to healthy controls (HC, N = 58) with respect to their self-reported regulation of positive and negative emotions. We used the Responses to Positive Affect Questionnaire to assess positive ER and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and Response Styles Questionnaire to assess negative ER. PTSD patients showed deficient negative as well as deficient positive ER as compared to HC. Both dampening of positive emotions as well as positive rumination were associated with self-reported symptom severity. Furthermore, dampening contributed to the prediction of PTSD symptom severity beyond depressive symptoms and negative rumination. This study supports and expands previous findings of dysfunctional positive ER in PTSD. Further research is needed to clarify whether deficits in positive ER contribute to the onset and maintenance of PTSD.

For the present study, pictures from the FACES database (rated as neutral) were digitally morphed to resemble the participants' (N=37) faces to varying degrees (25-50-75%). Perceptually matched geometrical shapes served as a control condition. At SOAs of either 300ms or 3000ms after picture onset, startle responses were elicited by white noise (50ms, 105dB), and recorded at the orbicularis oculi via EMG. Prior to the experiment, self-reported mood was assessed by means of the PANAS. Relative to non-face stimuli, the presentation of faces reduced startle magnitude at short, but not long, lead intervals. Furthermore, for probes presented at a SOA of 300ms, a linear decrease in startle magnitude with higher levels of self-resemblance was observed, presumably reflecting higher salience of the self-face. The startle modulating effect of self-resembling faces during longer lead intervals was moderated by the participants' current mood: negative affect predicted stronger patterns of attenuation, which might be interpreted as an increase in self-focus resulting from more negative mood.",2015,Jun,Int J Psychophysiol,96,3,162-8,25913094.0,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2015.04.009,,#98,Finke 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

In the present study, we investigate how the motive to drink due to social anxiety is associated with hazardous alcohol use over and above habitual alcohol use, social anxiety, and alcohol outcome expectancies. We also examine which factors define the motive to drink due to social anxiety and clarify the impact of the type of social situation. Drinking due to social anxiety, habitual alcohol use, and gender, but not social anxiety, were associated with hazardous alcohol use. Social anxiety increased the motive to drink due to social anxiety, but fear of cognitive performance deficits after drinking reduced it. Alcohol was used to reduce anxiety more frequently in situations where intake of alcohol is deemed socially acceptable. These findings suggest that the motive drinking due to social anxiety, not social anxiety per se, is related to hazardous alcohol use.

Neural signature of delayed fear generalization under stress,"Kausche, F. M.; Zerbes, G.; Kampermann, L.; Buchel, C.; Schwabe, L.","Although the generalization of fear to stimuli resembling a threatening stimulus is an adaptive mechanism, fear overgeneralization is maladaptive and thought to play a key role in anxiety-related disorders. Since there is typically a delay between an initial fear experience and a situation in which fear (over)generalization may occur, we assessed delayed fear generalization and its neural signature. Moreover, as stress is known to affect fear learning, we further tested whether acute stress modulates fear generalization. Therefore, we conducted a two-day fear generalization study, with initial fear acquisition on Day 1 and a fear generalization test after a 24-hr delay in the MRI scanner. Prior to fear generalization testing, participants were exposed to a stressor or a control manipulation. Our behavioral data showed the expected generalization of fear. At a neural level, fear generalization was accompanied by increased fear-signaling for stimuli that resembled the conditioned stimulus in the bilateral insula and frontal operculum, whereas activity declined in frontal, hippocampal, and temporal regions, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, as stimuli became more similar to the conditioned stimulus. Importantly, stress did not modulate fear generalization, neither on a behavioral nor on a neural level. Interestingly, in an explorative comparison to two other studies that used the same paradigm but tested generalization immediately after acquisition, we observed increased fear generalization in the delayed relative to the immediate generalization test. In sum, our results suggest that stress leaves fear generalization and its neural signature unaffected but that a temporal delay might increase the extent to which fear responses are generalized to stimuli resembling the threatening stimulus.",2021,Nov,Psychophysiology,58,11,e13917,34365641.0,10.1111/psyp.13917,,#100,Kausche 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Only cross-sectional associations for ratio cortisol/DHEA and PROMIS-depression remained significant after Bonferroni-Holm correction. No robust associations were observed in female participants. Social support exerted no consistent moderating effect on the investigated association.

For instance, are people who strongly empathize with others also more proficient in mentalizing? And (how) do the neural networks supporting empathy and mentalizing interact? Assessing both functions simultaneously in a large sample (N = 178), we show that people's capacities to empathize and mentalize are independent, both on a behavioral and neural level. Thus, strong empathizers are not necessarily proficient mentalizers, arguing against a general capacity of social understanding. Second, we applied dynamic causal modeling to investigate how the neural networks underlying empathy and mentalizing are orchestrated in naturalistic social settings. Results reveal that in highly emotional situations, empathic sharing can inhibit mentalizing-related activity and thereby harm mentalizing performance.

OCD is highly heritable, as are many of its comorbidities. A possible genetic heterogeneity of OCD in relation to its comorbid conditions, however, has not yet been exhaustively explored. We used a framework of different approaches to study the genetic relationship of OCD with three commonly observed comorbidities, namely major depressive disorder (MDD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). First, using publicly available summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies, we compared genetic correlation patterns for OCD, MDD, ADHD, and ASD with 861 somatic and mental health phenotypes. Secondly, we examined how polygenic risk scores (PRS) of eight traits that showed heterogeneous correlation patterns with OCD, MDD, ADHD, and ASD partitioned across comorbid subgroups in OCD using independent unpublished data from the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH). The comorbid subgroups comprised of patients with only OCD (N = 366), OCD and MDD (N = 1,052), OCD and ADHD (N = 443), OCD and ASD (N = 388), and OCD with more than 1 comorbidity (N = 429).

Macrocephaly as a clinical indicator of genetic subtypes in autism,"Klein, S.; Sharifi-Hannauer, P.; Martinez-Agosto, J. A.","An association between autism and macrocephaly has been previously described. A subset of cases with extreme macrocephaly (>3 standard deviation [SD], 99.7th percentile) have been correlated to mutations in the gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). However, the phenotypic and genetic characterization of the remaining cases remains unclear. We report the phenotypic classification and genetic testing evaluation of a cohort of 33 patients with autism and macrocephaly. Within our cohort, we confirm the association of PTEN mutations and extreme macrocephaly (>3 SD, 99.7th percentile) and identify mutations in 22% of cases, including three novel PTEN mutations. In addition, we define three phenotypic subgroups: (a) those cases associated with somatic overgrowth, (b) those with disproportionate macrocephaly, and (c) those with relative macrocephaly. We have devised a novel way to segregate patients into these subgroups that will aide in the stratification of autism macrocephaly cases. Within these subgroups, we further expand the genetic etiologies for autism cases with macrocephaly by describing two novel suspected pathogenic copy number variants located at 6q23.2 and 10q24.32. These findings demonstrate the phenotypic heterogeneity of autism cases associated with macrocephaly and their genetic etiologies.

Preventing maltreatment in institutional care: A cluster-randomized controlled trial in East Africa,"Hecker, T.; Mkinga, G.; Kirika, A.; Nkuba, M.; Preston, J.; Hermenau, K.","An increasing number of orphans in low- and middle-income countries are living in institutional care facilities where they experience poor quality of care and ongoing maltreatment. To prevent maltreatment, we tested the effectiveness and feasibility of the intervention Interaction Competencies with Children - for Caregivers (ICC-C). In a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial, 203 caregivers (65.5% female, M(age) = 36.63 years, SD(age) = 12.26) and 356 children (46.1% female, M(age) = 9.43 years, SD(age) = 1.93) from 24 orphanages in Dar es salaam (Tanzania) participated from August to October 2018 (Baseline) and March to April 2019 (Follow-Up). Orphanages were assigned to the intervention or waitlist-group. Caregivers in the intervention group received the ICC-C intervention to prevent maltreatment through focusing on non-violent caregiving strategies. The primary outcome was the change in self-reported maltreatment by caregivers (Conflict Tactics Scale). Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03594617, 20 July 2018. Participation in the intervention resulted in a significant reduction in reported maltreatment (f(2) = 0.153), a decrease of positive attitudes toward violent discipline (f(2) = 0.248), and an increased level of childcare knowledge (f(2) = 0.220) in the caregiver sample, each indicating a moderate effect. Caregivers' training participation did not predict reduced maltreatment reported by children. Aspects of feasibility, including motivation to participate, acceptability, and integration of the new strategies were evaluated positively.

Gender differences in episodic memory and visual working memory including the effects of age,"Pauls, F.; Petermann, F.; Lepach, A. C.","Analysing the relationship between gender and memory, and examining the effects of age on the overall memory-related functioning, are the ongoing goals of psychological research. The present study examined gender and age group differences in episodic memory with respect to the type of task. In addition, these subgroup differences were also analysed in visual working memory. A sample of 366 women and 330 men, aged between 16 and 69 years of age, participated in the current study. Results indicate that women outperformed men on auditory memory tasks, whereas male adolescents and older male adults showed higher level performances on visual episodic and visual working memory measures. However, the size of gender-linked effects varied somewhat across age groups. Furthermore, results partly support a declining performance on episodic memory and visual working memory measures with increasing age. Although age-related losses in episodic memory could not be explained by a decreasing verbal and visuospatial ability with age, women's advantage in auditory episodic memory could be explained by their advantage in verbal ability. Men's higher level visual episodic memory performance was found to result from their advantage in visuospatial ability.

Thigmotaxis in a virtual human open field test,"Gromer, D.; Kiser, D. P.; Pauli, P.","Animal models are used to study neurobiological mechanisms in mental disorders. Although there has been significant progress in the understanding of neurobiological underpinnings of threat-related behaviors and anxiety, little progress was made with regard to new or improved treatments for mental disorders. A possible reason for this lack of success is the unknown predictive and cross-species translational validity of animal models used in preclinical studies. Re-translational approaches, therefore, seek to establish cross-species translational validity by identifying behavioral operations shared across species. To this end, we implemented a human open field test in virtual reality and measured behavioral indices derived from animal studies in three experiments ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text]). In addition, we investigated the associations between anxious traits and such behaviors. Results indicated a strong similarity in behavior across species, i.e., participants in our study-like rodents in animal studies-preferred to stay in the outer region of the open field, as indexed by multiple behavioral parameters. However, correlational analyses did not clearly indicate that these behaviors were a function of anxious traits of participants. We conclude that the realized virtual open field test is able to elicit thigmotaxis and thus demonstrates cross-species validity of this aspect of the test. Modulatory effects of anxiety on human open field behavior should be examined further by incorporating possible threats in the virtual scenario and/or by examining participants with higher anxiety levels or anxiety disorder patients.",2021,Mar 23,Sci Rep,11,1,6670,33758204.0,10.1038/s41598-021-85678-5,,#109,Gromer 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Effects of context preexposure and delay until anxiety retrieval on generalization of contextual anxiety,"Andreatta, M.; Neueder, D.; Glotzbach-Schoon, E.; Muhlberger, A.; Pauli, P.","Animal studies suggest that time delay between acquisition and retrieval of contextual anxiety increases generalization. Moreover, such generalization is prevented by preexposure to the context (CTX), presumably due to an improved representation of such context. We investigated whether preexposure and time-passing modulate generalization of contextual anxiety, in humans. On Day 1, 42 participants (preexposure group) explored two virtual offices, while 41 participants (no-preexposure group) explored a virtual stadium. On Day 2 (24 h later), all participants learned to associate one office (CTX+) with unpredictable unconditioned stimuli (USs), and another office (CTX-) with safety. On Day 3, either 24 h (recent test) or 2 wk (remote test) later, participants revisited CTX- and CTX+ without USs, as well as a generalization context (G-CTX). Results revealed successfully conditioned anxiety and anxiety generalization for ratings (G-CTX was as aversive as CTX+ was), while safety generalization was found for startle responses (G-CTX elicited startle attenuation as CTX- did). Time between learning and testing enhanced generalization as reflected by comparable startle responses to all three offices in the remote test. Contextual preexposure facilitated extinction of explicit conditioned anxiety assessed with ratings. These results suggest that memory trace of a context degrades with passage of time in humans like in animals and, consequently, anxiety generalization enhances. After context preexposure, high cognitive processes seem to be crucially involved in facilitating extinction (or safety) learning.",2017,Jan,Learn Mem,24,1,43-54,27980075.0,10.1101/lm.044073.116,,#110,Andreatta 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Therapy Dogs as a Crisis Intervention After Traumatic Events? - An Experimental Study,"Lass-Hennemann, J.; Schafer, S.

In animal-assisted crisis response, dogs are used directly after a traumatic event to reduce stress and anxiety. However, to date there are few controlled studies investigating the effects of therapy dogs on PTSD symptoms and to our knowledge there is no study investigating the effects of a therapy dog intervention directly after a traumatic event. In this study, 60 healthy female participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: after exposure to a ""traumatic"" film clip (trauma-film paradigm), one group of participants interacted with a friendly dog for 15 min, another group of participants watched a film clip showing a person interacting with a friendly dog and the last group was instructed to relax. Participants who had interacted with the dog after the film reported lower anxiety levels, less negative affect, and more positive affect after the intervention as compared to the other two groups. However, the participants who interacted with the dog showed a smaller decrease in physiological arousal after the traumatic film clip compared to both other groups. There were no differences in intrusion symptoms between the three groups.

Dissociation of Endogenous Pain Inhibition Due to Conditioned Pain Modulation and Placebo in Male Athletes Versus Nonathletes,"Geisler, M.; Herbsleb, M.; Bar, K. J.; Weiss, T.","Animals and humans are able to inhibit pain by activating their endogenous pain-inhibition system. Endurance athletes possess a higher pain-tolerance threshold and a greater conditioned pain modulation (CPM) effect than nonathletes, suggesting better endogenous pain inhibition. In addition to CPM, placebo is another prominent paradigm used to test endogenous pain inhibition. However, whether the placebo effect and the CPM effect share the same mechanisms of pain inhibition has not been investigated. If there is a shared mechanism, then endurance athletes should show not only a better CPM effect than nonathletes but also a greater placebo effect. Here, we investigated 16 male endurance athletes and 17 male nonathletes in well-established placebo and CPM paradigms to assess whether endurance athletes have a better endogenous pain-inhibition system than nonathletes. As expected, we find a significantly greater CPM effect in athletes than in nonathletes. In contrast, we could only find a significant placebo effect in nonathletes. Explorative analyses reveal negative associations between the placebo effect and heart rate variability as well as between the placebo effect and interoceptive awareness. Together, the results demonstrate a dissociation of endogenous pain inhibition of CPM and placebo effect between endurance athletes and nonathletes.

Transcranial direct current stimulation improves clinical symptoms in adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Soff, C.; Sotnikova, A.; Christiansen, H.; Becker, K.; Siniatchkin, M.","Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the prefrontal cortex has repeatedly been shown to improve working memory. As patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterized by both underactivation of the prefrontal cortex and deficits in working memory that correlate with clinical symptoms, it is hypothesized that the modulation of prefrontal activity with tDCS in patients with ADHD increases performance in working memory and reduces symptoms of ADHD. To test this hypothesis, fifteen adolescents with ADHD (12-16 years old, three girls and 12 boys) were treated according to the randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled, crossover design with either 1 mA anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or with the sham protocol 5 days each with a 2 weeks pause between these conditions. Anodal tDCS caused a significant reduction in clinical symptoms of inattention and impulsivity in adolescents with ADHD compared to sham stimulation. The clinical effects were supported by a significant reduction in inattention and hyperactivity in a standardized working memory test (QbTest). The described effects were more pronounced 7 days after the end of stimulation, a fact which emphasizes the long-lasting clinical and neuropsychological changes after tDCS. This study provides the first evidence that tDCS may reduce symptoms of ADHD and improve neuropsychological functioning in adolescents and points on the potential of tDCS as a form of treatment for ADHD.",2017,Jan,J Neural Transm (Vienna),124,1,133-144,27853926.0,10.1007/s00702-016-1646-y,,#113,Soff 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Since human interactions have a tremendous impact on our mental and physical well-being, scientists are increasingly investigating the basic processes that enable successful social interactions such as social affect (empathy, compassion) and social cognition (Theory of Mind). However, regarding the replication crisis in psychological science it is crucial to probe the reproducibility of findings revealed by each specific method. To this end, we aimed to replicate the effect of age on empathy, compassion and Theory of Mind observed in Reiter and colleagues' study (Reiter et al. 2017 Sci.

"""I just don't look forward to anything"". How anticipatory pleasure and negative beliefs contribute to goal-directed activity in patients with negative symptoms of psychosis","Pillny, M.; Schlier, B.; Lincoln, T. M.","Anticipatory pleasure refers to a state of positive affect in anticipation of future events that has been found to motivate goal-directed behavior. Previous research has indicated that patients with negative symptoms of psychosis show reduced goal-directed behavior because 'demotivating beliefs' impede anticipatory pleasure. This study aims to link demotivating beliefs and anticipatory pleasure to patients' motivation in everyday life. Using the Experience Sampling Method, we examined the motivational process of goal-directed activity in the daily lives of 35 patients with negative symptoms and 36 healthy controls. We tested whether the mechanism underlying goal-directed behavior differs between patients and healthy controls and whether demotivating beliefs interfere with goal-directed behavior by impeding anticipatory pleasure. Multilevel analyses revealed that anticipatory pleasure mediated the association between goal-intentions and goal-directed activity in both groups (indirect effects: 24-30%). In the patient group, however, the association between social goal-intentions and anticipatory pleasure was weaker (b = -0.09, SE = 0.05, p </= .01, [-0.17;-0.04]) than in the controls, but this was not found for goal-intentions related self-care or recreational activites. Also, demotivating beliefs were more pronounced in the patient sample.

Our results support the assumption that a set of demotivating beliefs prevents patients with negative symptoms from looking forward to social activities and thus provide a possible psychological explanation for the social withdrawal of patients with negative symptoms.",2020,Aug,Schizophr Res,222,,429-436,32389616.0,10.1016/j.schres.2020.03.059,,#115,Pillny 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Brain activity associated with illusory correlations in animal phobia,"Wiemer, J.; Schulz, S. M.; Reicherts, P.; Glotzbach-Schoon, E.; Andreatta, M.; Pauli, P.","Anxiety disorder patients were repeatedly found to overestimate the association between disorder-relevant stimuli and aversive outcomes despite random contingencies. Such an illusory correlation (IC) might play an important role in the return of fear after extinction learning; yet, little is known about how this cognitive bias emerges in the brain. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 18 female patients with spider phobia and 18 healthy controls were exposed to pictures of spiders, mushrooms and puppies followed randomly by either a painful electrical shock or nothing. In advance, both patients and healthy controls expected more shocks after spider pictures. Importantly, only patients with spider phobia continued to overestimate this association after the experiment. The strength of this IC was predicted by increased outcome aversiveness ratings and primary sensory motor cortex activity in response to the shock after spider pictures. Moreover, increased activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to spider pictures predicted the IC. These results support the theory that phobia-relevant stimuli amplify unpleasantness and sensory motor representations of aversive stimuli, which in turn may promote their overestimation. Hyper-activity in dlPFC possibly reflects a pre-occupation of executive resources with phobia-relevant stimuli, thus complicating the accurate monitoring of objective contingencies and the unlearning of fear.",2015,Jul,Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci,10,7,969-77,25411452.0,10.1093/scan/nsu142,,#116,Wiemer 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Recognition memory, primacy vs. recency effects, and time perception in the online version of the fear of scream paradigm","Zlomuzica, A.; Kullmann, F.; Hesse, J.; Plank, L.; Dere, E.","Anxiety disorders are characterized by cognitive dysfunctions which contribute to the patient's profound disabilities. The threat of shock paradigm represents a validated psychopathological model of anxiety to measure the impact of anxiety on cognitive processes. We have developed an online version of the threat of scream paradigm (ToSP) to investigate the impact of experimental anxiety on recognition memory. Two animated passive walkthrough videos (either under threat of scream or safety conditions) were shown to healthy participants. Recognition memory, primacy vs. recency effects, and subjective estimations of the length of encoding sessions were assessed. Subjective anxiety, stress, and emotional arousal ratings indicated that experimental anxiety could successfully be induced (Safe-Threat) or reversed (Threat-Safe) between the two passive walkthrough sessions. Participants exposed to distress screams showed impaired retrieval of complex information that has been presented in an animated environment. In the threat condition, participants failed to recognize details related to the persons encountered, their spatial locations, as well as information about the temporal order and sequence of encounters. Participant groups, which received a threat announcement prior to the first walkthrough session (Threat-Threat vs. Safety-Safety and Threat-Safety vs. Safety-Threat) showed poorer recognition memory as compared to the groups that received a safety announcement (P = 0.0468 and P = 0.0426, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test, Cohen's d = 0.5071; effect size r = 0.2458).

Amygdala hyperactivation during symptom provocation in obsessive-compulsive disorder and its modulation by distraction,"Simon, D.; Adler, N.; Kaufmann, C.; Kathmann, N.","Anxiety disorders have been linked to a hyperactivated cortico-amygdalar circuitry. Recent findings highlight the amygdala's role in mediating elevated anxiety in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, modulation of amygdala hyperactivation by attentional distraction - an effective emotion regulation strategy in healthy individuals - has not yet been examined. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging twenty-one unmedicated OCD patients and 21 controls performed an evaluation and a distraction task during symptom provocation with individually tailored OCD-relevant pictures. To test the specificity of responses, additional aversive and neutral stimuli were included. Significant group-by-picture type interactions were observed within fronto-striato-limbic circuits including the amygdala. In these regions patients showed increased BOLD responses during processing of OCD triggers relative to healthy controls. Amygdala hyperactivation was present across OCD symptom dimensions indicating that it represents a common neural correlate. During distraction, we observed dampening of patients' amygdala hyperactivity to OCD-relevant stimuli. Augmented amygdala involvement in patients during symptom provocation, present across OCD symptom dimensions, might constitute a correlate of fear expression in OCD linking it to other anxiety disorders. Attentional distraction seemed to dampen emotional processing of disorder-relevant stimuli via amygdala downregulation. The clinical impact of this strategy to manage anxiety in OCD should be further elucidated.",2014,,Neuroimage Clin,4,,549-57,24818080.0,10.1016/j.nicl.2014.03.011,,#118,Simon 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Investigating sustained attention in contextual threat using steady-state VEPs evoked by flickering video stimuli,"Stegmann, Y.; Andreatta, M.; Pauli, P.; Keil, A.; Wieser, M. J.","Anxiety is characterized by anxious anticipation and heightened vigilance to uncertain threat. However, if threat is not reliably indicated by a specific cue, the context in which threat was previously experienced becomes its best predictor, leading to anxiety. A suitable means to induce anxiety experimentally is context conditioning: In one context (CTX+), an unpredictable aversive stimulus (US) is repeatedly presented, in contrast to a second context (CTX-), in which no US is ever presented. In this EEG study, we investigated attentional mechanisms during acquisition and extinction learning in 38 participants, who underwent a context conditioning protocol. Flickering video stimuli (32 s clips depicting virtual offices representing CTX+/-) were used to evoke steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) as an index of visuocortical engagement with the contexts. Analyses of the electrocortical responses suggest a successful induction of the ssVEP signal by video presentation in flicker mode. Furthermore, we found clear indices of context conditioning and extinction learning on a subjective level, while cortical processing of the CTX+ was unexpectedly reduced during video presentation. The differences between CTX+ and CTX- diminished during extinction learning. Together, these results indicate that the dynamic sensory input of the video presentation leads to disruptions in the ssVEP signal, which is greater for motivationally significant, threatening contexts.",2023,May,Psychophysiology,60,5,e14229,36416714.0,10.1111/psyp.14229,,#119,Stegmann 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Illusory correlations between neutral and aversive stimuli can be induced by outcome aversiveness,"Wiemer, J.; Muhlberger, A.; Pauli, P.","Anxiety is often characterised by an overestimation of the contingency between concern-relevant and aversive stimuli, and an amplified aversiveness of such aversive stimuli. Here we tested whether outcome aversiveness causally enhances contingency estimates. Twenty-four participants were exposed to neutral visual cues which were followed by startle sounds. The loudness and hence the aversiveness of the cue was determined by the cue colour while the likelihood of the startle sound always remained constant (50%). Results indicated an illusory correlation specifically for the cue followed by the most aversive startle sound as reflected in enhanced on-line and a posteriori covariation estimates. This bias was positively correlated with state and trait anxiety. Physiological arousal measured by pupil diameter was enhanced in response to the most aversive startle sound confirming its distinct processing. In conclusion, these results suggest that aversive outcomes may induce illusory correlations, most likely in anxious persons, and explain previous findings of illusory correlations in anxiety disorders.",2014,2013/07/08,Cogn Emot,28,2,193-207,23829308.0,10.1080/02699931.2013.809699,,#120,Wiemer 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Generalization of Conditioned Contextual Anxiety and the Modulatory Effects of Anxiety Sensitivity,"Andreatta, M.; Neueder, D.; Herzog, K.; Genheimer, H.; Schiele, M. A.; Deckert, J.; Domschke, K.; Reif, A.; Wieser, M. J.; Pauli, P.","Anxiety patients overgeneralize fear responses, possibly because they cannot distinguish between cues never been associated with a threat (i.e., safe) and threat-associated cues. However, as contexts and not cues are discussed as the relevant triggers for prolonged anxiety responses characterizing many anxiety disorders, we speculated that it is rather overgeneralization of contextual anxiety, which constitutes a risk factor for anxiety disorders. To this end, we investigated generalization of conditioned contextual anxiety and explored modulatory effects of anxiety sensitivity, a risk factor for anxiety disorders. Fifty-five participants underwent context conditioning in a virtual reality paradigm. On Day 1 (acquisition), participants received unpredictable mildly painful electric stimuli (unconditioned stimulus, US) in one virtual office (anxiety context, CTX+), but never in a second office (safety context, CTX-). Successful acquisition of conditioned anxiety was indicated by aversive ratings and defensive physiological responses (i.e., SCR) to CTX+ vs CTX-. On Day 2 (generalization), participants re-visited both the anxiety and the safety contexts plus three generalization contexts (G-CTX), which were gradually dissimilar to CTX+ (from 75 to 25%). Generalization of conditioned anxiety was evident for ratings, but less clear for physiological responses. The observed dissociation between generalization of verbal and physiological responses suggests that these responses depend on two distinct context representations, likely elemental and contextual representations. Importantly, anxiety sensitivity was positively correlated with the generalization of reported contextual anxiety. Thus, this study demonstrates generalization gradients for conditioned contextual anxiety and that anxiety sensitivity facilitates such generalization processes suggesting the importance of generalization of contextual anxiety for the development of anxiety disorders.",2020,Jul,Neurotherapeutics,17,3,1239-1252,31933066.0,10.1007/s13311-020-00831-8,,#121,Andreatta 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Results revealed that anxious apprehension was associated with more left-than-right frontal brain activity in the lower alpha band, an effect driven by decreased right frontal activity. Exploratory analyses showed more left-than-right brain activity at central sites associated with anxious apprehension. Parietal activity was not lateralized as a function of anxiety dimensions.

Sleep-dependent memory consolidation in infants protects new episodic memories from existing semantic memories,"Friedrich, M.; Molle, M.; Friederici, A.

The beginnings of this declarative memory formation are only poorly understood. Even less is known about the interrelation between episodic and semantic memory during the earliest developmental stages. Here, we show that the formation of episodic memories in 14- to 17-month-old infants depends on sleep, subsequent to exposure to novel events. Infant brain responses reveal that, after sleep-dependent consolidation, the newly stored events are not processed semantically, although appropriate lexical-semantic memories are present and accessible by similar events that were not experienced before the nap. We propose that temporarily disabled semantic processing protects precise episodic memories from interference with generalized semantic memories.

Appearance Teasing and Mental Health: Gender Differences and Mediation Effects of Appearance-Based Rejection Sensitivity and Dysmorphic Concerns,"Schmidt, J.; Martin, A.","Appearance teasing is a common phenomenon in social interactions, especially in adolescence. Several studies have shown its negative impact on mental health as well as on body image. While these findings prove stable in various contexts, less evidence is available for possible gender differences in these relationships. In particular, the role of two important body image variables - appearance-based rejection sensitivity (ARS) and dysmorphic concerns - and their contribution to mental health impairments has not been assessed in gender-specific process models. In a cross-sectional survey-study (N = 501; 407 f, 94 m), we retrospectively assessed early appearance teasing experiences, as well as current ARS, dysmorphic concerns, depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. We analyzed gender differences in these variables and their interrelations. We then examined the mediating role of ARS and dysmorphic concerns in explaining mental health variables in adulthood due to early appearance teasing in gender-specific serial-mediation models. The results show high ratios of early teasing experiences, but no significant gender difference regarding the frequency of early appearance teasing. While teasing experiences were significantly related to body image variables in adulthood in both genders (rs > 0.32; ps < 0.010), we observed significant relations with mental health outcomes in women (rs > 0.30; ps < 0.001) but not in men (rs < 0.20; ps > 0.250). Serial mediation models show that ARS and dysmorphic concerns mediate the effects of appearance teasing on mental health in all outcomes in women (DeltaR(2) > 0.17), but not in men (DeltaR(2) < 0.03). Findings remained stable when controlling for Body-Mass-Index, age, and relationship-status. The findings show similar frequencies of appearance teasing and associated negative effects on body image in men and women. Specifically, in women, the effects of teasing on mental health were stronger and mediated by ARS and dysmorphic concerns. Overall, the results point to the relevance of ARS for etiological models of body image disorders and female mental health. However, men did not show the same relationships of teasing and mental health. Differential resilience factors regarding the negative effects of early appearance teasing could be an important target for future research.",2019,2019/03/20,Front Psychol,10,,579,30949099.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00579,,#125,Schmidt 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Impact of COMT Val158Met-polymorphism on appetitive conditioning and amygdala/prefrontal effective connectivity,"Klucken, T.; Kruse, O.; Wehrum-Osinsky, S.; Hennig, J.; Schweckendiek, J.; Stark, R.","Appetitive conditioning is an important mechanism for the development, maintenance, and treatment of psychiatric disorders like substance abuse. Therefore, it is important to identify genetic variations, which impact appetitive conditioning. It has been suggested that the Val(158) Met-polymorphism in the Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) is associated with the alteration of neural processes of appetitive conditioning due to the central role of the dopaminergic system in reward processing. However, no study has so far investigated the relationship between variations in the COMT Val(158) Met-polymorphism and appetitive conditioning. In this fMRI study, an appetitive conditioning paradigm was applied, in which one neutral stimulus (CS+) predicted appetitive stimuli (UCS) while a second neutral stimulus (CS-) was never paired with the UCS. As a main result, we observed a significant association between the COMT Val(158) Met-genotype and appetitive conditioning: skin conductance responses (SCRs) revealed a significant difference between CS+ and CS- in Val/Val-allele carriers but not in the other genotype groups. Val/Val-allele carriers showed increased hemodynamic responses in the amygdala compared with the Met/Met-allele group in the contrast CS+ > CS-. In addition, psychophysiological-interaction analysis revealed increased effective amygdala/ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity in Met/Met-allele carriers. The increased amygdala activity points to facilitated appetitive conditioning in Val/Val-allele carriers while the amygdala/prefrontal connectivity results could be regarded as a marker for altered emotion regulation during conditioning, which potentially impacts appetitive learning sensitivity. The SCRs finding indicates a stronger conditioned response in the Val/Val-allele group and dovetails with the neural differences between the groups. These findings contribute to the current research on COMT in emotional processing.",2015,Mar,Hum Brain Mapp,36,3,1093-101,25394948.0,10.1002/hbm.22688,,#126,Klucken 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The relationship between neuroticism and appetitive conditioning,"Klucken, T.; Kruse, O.; Klein, S.; Kampa, M.; Tapia Leon, I.; Stark, R.","Appetitive conditioning is considered a central mechanism for the vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. However, the investigation of individual differences that are related to altered appetitive learning has been almost neglected so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the link between neuroticism and appetitive conditioning processes. 79 subjects participated in a differential conditioning procedure in which a conditioned stimulus (CS+) was paired with a reward (money) after a fast behavioral response, while a second conditioned stimulus (CS-) was never followed by a reward, irrespective of the behavioral response. As a main result, neuroticism correlated negatively with the underlying neural processes of appetitive conditioning in females, but not in males. In detail, higher levels of neuroticism were associated with decreased neural responses in the left (p = .001) and right amygdala (p = .011), left (p = .063) and right (p = .019) nucleus accumbens, and left (p = .002) and right (p = .021) orbitofrontal cortex (all results are family-wise-error-corrected). The present results support previous findings, which also showed an inverse sex-specific effect in the context of neuroticism and emotional processing in females. In addition, the findings suggest that neuroticism is not solely linked to increased amygdala sensitivity during the processing of negative stimuli but also to decreased neural responses when processing rewarding stimuli. Possible explanations for the sex differences and implications are discussed.",2019,Oct,Neurobiol Learn Mem,164,,107068,31415871.0,10.1016/j.nlm.2019.107068,,#127,Klucken 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Combining D-cycloserine with appetitive extinction learning modulates amygdala activity during recall,"Ebrahimi, C.; Koch, S. P.; Friedel, E.; Crespo, I.; Fydrich, T.; Strohle, A.; Heinz, A.; Schlagenhauf, F.","Appetitive Pavlovian conditioning plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of drug addiction and conditioned reward cues can trigger craving and relapse even after long phases of abstinence. Promising preclinical work showed that the NMDA-receptor partial agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) facilitates Pavlovian extinction learning of fear and drug cues. Furthermore, DCS-augmented exposure therapy seems to be beneficial in various anxiety disorders, while the supposed working mechanism of DCS during human appetitive or aversive extinction learning is still not confirmed. To test the hypothesis that DCS administration before extinction training improves extinction learning, healthy adults (n=32) underwent conditioning, extinction, and extinction recall on three successive days in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fMRI design. Monetary wins and losses served as unconditioned stimuli during conditioning to probe appetitive and aversive learning. An oral dose of 50mg of DCS or placebo was administered 1h before extinction training and DCS effects during extinction recall were evaluated on a behavioral and neuronal level. We found attenuated amygdala activation in the DCS compared to the placebo group during recall of the extinguished appetitive cue, along with evidence for enhanced functional amygdala-vmPFC coupling in the DCS group. While the absence of additional physiological measures of conditioned responses during recall in this study prevent the evaluation of a behavioral DCS effect, our neuronal findings are in accordance with recent theories linking successful extinction recall in humans to modulatory top-down influences from the vmPFC that inhibit amygdala activation. Our results should encourage further translational studies concerning the usefulness of DCS to target maladaptive Pavlovian reward associations.",2017,Jul,Neurobiol Learn Mem,142,Pt B,209-217,28512009.0,10.1016/j.nlm.2017.05.008,,#128,Ebrahimi 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Four-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of triple p group for parent and child outcomes,"Heinrichs, N.; Kliem, S.; Hahlweg, K.","Approximately 15-20% of children experience behavioral and/or emotional difficulties. Evidence-based treatment will likely not be sufficient to reduce the prevalence of these difficulties in children and adolescents. Effective prevention programs are therefore also needed to enable families access to support at multiple points across the lifecourse. The aim of the current investigation was to evaluate the 4-year efficacy of the group-based Triple P (Positive Parenting Program) as a prevention program administered universally. Seventeen preschools were randomly assigned to Triple P (n = 11 preschools, 186 families) or a no parenting intervention control group (n = 6 preschools, 94 families). Long-term efficacy was analyzed with hierarchical linear models using maternal and paternal self-report measures. Mothers and fathers from the intervention preschool group reported significant reductions in dysfunctional parenting behavior (d = 0.24 and 0.19, respectively). Mothers also reported a less steep decline from pre- to post-intervention in positive parenting behavior, which was maintained 4 years later (d = 0.38). Fathers from intervention preschools reported a delayed less steep decline in positive parenting during the follow-up (d = 0.33). In addition, mothers from intervention preschools reported immediate improvement in child behavior problems during the program while mothers from control preschools did not report this immediate change. However, with mothers from intervention preschools reporting more child behavior problems at baseline, the effect disappeared by the fourth year (d = 0.19).

This treatment gap may be diminished by the implementation of low-threshold treatment programs. As cognitive distortions play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of gambling problems, interventions targeting gambling-related biases may be particularly effective. The aim of the present study was to examine the feasibility, acceptance, and safety of a novel metacognitive training for individuals with gambling problems (Gambling-MCT). Twenty-five participants were included in an uncontrolled pilot trial with two assessment points (intervention). The intervention comprised eight training modules targeting gambling-specific cognitive distortions. At baseline and post assessment, symptom severity, as measured with the PG-YBOCS, and gambling-related cognitive distortions, as measured with the GABS, were assessed. In addition, interim assessments measuring session-specific changes were conducted. Subjective appraisal was examined after each module and also post treatment. On average, participants took part in 4.16 (SD = 2.84) training sessions. Both intent-to-treat and per protocol analyses showed significant improvements on the PG-YBOCS and the GABS (d(z) = 0.37-1.37). After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, linear mixed models for the analysis of session-specific changes showed no deterioration in participants' mental state after any of the modules. Subjective appraisal of Gambling-MCT was good. The present pilot study provides first evidence for the feasibility, acceptance, and safety of Gambling-MCT.

Previous studies concerning this question did not examine responses to unexpected spider stimuli, although this is an ecologically valid situation. Therefore, we conducted an inattentional blindness (IB) experiment. While unselected participants (N = 120) were focusing their attention on a visual discrimination task, suddenly a spider or a flower image appeared. The rates of reported detection were not enhanced for spider images, and fear of spiders had no moderating influence on IB rates. However, spider pictures in general elicited greater skin conductance responses than flower pictures, and this difference was also observed for pictures that were not reported afterward. Moreover, eye movement data revealed that the spider stimulus was initially fixated more often than the flower stimulus. In sum, our findings imply that enhanced reactions to unexpected spider images are independent of fear level and include early engagement processes.

A randomized-controlled trial of heart rate variability biofeedback for psychotic symptoms,"Clamor, A.; Koenig, J.; Thayer, J. F.; Lincoln, T. M.","Arousal and the way it is coped with are relevant to the emergence of psychotic symptoms. Heart rate variability (HRV) stems from autonomic responses to environmental demands such as stress and is an index of physiological arousal, adaptability, and homeostatic reflexes forming autonomic balance. A randomized-controlled between-subjects trial that compared HRV-biofeedback (BF) to an active relaxation and to a waiting control condition was conducted in a sample with attenuated subclinical psychotic symptoms (N = 84). A 20-min intervention was preceded and followed by repeated assessments of stress responses. Change scores of the post-stress periods were analyzed using ANOVAs for HRV, subjective stress, perceived control, and state paranoia. As expected, BF participants showed greater improvements in perceived control than waiting controls (p = 0.006). However, no group differences occurred in HRV, paranoid symptoms or subjective stress. In exploratory analyses in a subset of participants who were breathing per protocol, the expected effects were found for total HRV and state paranoia. Thus, this trial of HRV-BF for people with attenuated psychotic symptoms indicates that the intervention may hold potential if conducted per protocol. To reach this, longer training might be inevitable. Future studies are needed to further elucidate efficacy and applicability of HRV-BF in clinical samples.",2016,Dec,Behav Res Ther,87,,207-215,27768984.0,10.1016/j.brat.2016.10.003,,#132,Clamor 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Does perpetrating violence damage mental health? Differences between forcibly recruited and voluntary combatants in DR Congo,"Hecker, T.; Hermenau, K.; Maedl, A.; Hinkel, H.; Schauer, M.; Elbert, T.","As a consequence of the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), combatants are constantly involved in various forms of violence. Findings concerning the impact of perpetrating violence on mental health are contradictory, ranging from increasing to buffering the risk for mental ill health. The present study investigated the impact of perpetrating violence on mental health. In total, 204 forcibly recruited and voluntary male combatants (mean age = 24.61 years) from different armed groups in the eastern DRC took part in the study. In a semistructured interview, respondents were questioned about appetitive aggression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as self-experienced violence and self-perpetrated violent offending. A multivariate analysis of variance (eta(2) = .23) revealed that voluntary combatants perpetrated more violent acts (eta(2) = .06) and showed higher appetitive aggression eta(2) = .03). A moderated multiple regression analysis (R(2) = .20) showed that perpetrating violence was positively related to PTSD in forcibly recruited combatants, but not in voluntary combatants. Thus, perpetrating violence may not necessarily qualify as a traumatic stressor.

Neural correlates of training and transfer effects in working memory in older adults,"Heinzel, S.; Lorenz, R. C.; Pelz, P.; Heinz, A.; Walter, H.; Kathmann, N.; Rapp, M. A.; Stelzel, C.","As indicated by previous research, aging is associated with a decline in working memory (WM) functioning, related to alterations in fronto-parietal neural activations. At the same time, previous studies showed that WM training in older adults may improve the performance in the trained task (training effect), and more importantly, also in untrained WM tasks (transfer effects). However, neural correlates of these transfer effects that would improve understanding of its underlying mechanisms, have not been shown in older participants as yet. In this study, we investigated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes during n-back performance and an untrained delayed recognition (Sternberg) task following 12sessions (45min each) of adaptive n-back training in older adults. The Sternberg task used in this study allowed to test for neural training effects independent of specific task affordances of the trained task and to separate maintenance from updating processes. Thirty-two healthy older participants (60-75years) were assigned either to an n-back training or a no-contact control group. Before (t1) and after (t2) training/waiting period, both the n-back task and the Sternberg task were conducted while BOLD signal was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in all participants. In addition, neuropsychological tests were performed outside the scanner. WM performance improved with training and behavioral transfer to tests measuring executive functions, processing speed, and fluid intelligence was found. In the training group, BOLD signal in the right lateral middle frontal gyrus/caudal superior frontal sulcus (Brodmann area, BA 6/8) decreased in both the trained n-back and the updating condition of the untrained Sternberg task at t2, compared to the control group. fMRI findings indicate a training-related increase in processing efficiency of WM networks, potentially related to the process of WM updating. Performance gains in untrained tasks suggest that transfer to other cognitive tasks remains possible in aging.",2016,Jul 1,NeuroImage,134,,236-249,27046110.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.03.068,,#134,Heinzel 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Higher sense of coherence is associated with better mental and physical health in emergency medical services: results from investigations on the revised sense of coherence scale (SOC-R) in rescue workers,"Behnke, A.; Conrad, D.; Kolassa, I. T.; Rojas, R.","As rescue workers are regularly confronted with potentially traumatising on-duty events, they have an increased risk to develop trauma-related mental and physical health impairments, including post-traumatic, depressive, and somatic symptoms. For this high-risk group, it could be of particular importance to experience their occupational burden as manageable, meaningful, and coherent. This mindset - called sense of coherence - may be a potential resilience factor against the development of mental and physical health problems. In a cross-sectional cohort of 102 rescue workers (Mdn(QD)(age) = 26.0 (8.5), age range: 18-61), including 36 women, we investigated whether higher values on the Revised Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-R) predicted lower post-traumatic, depressive, and somatic symptoms. In addition, we evaluated the factor structure of the SOC-R using confirmatory factor analyses. Linear regressions indicated that higher SOC-R, but particularly manageability scores were associated with less post-traumatic (beta = -.31, p = .009), depressive (beta = -.44, p < .001), and somatic symptoms (beta = -.36, p = .002). Furthermore, we found that all symptom scores significantly increased with occupational and private-life trauma exposure. The SOC-R's factor structure was replicated, comprising the three subscales manageability, reflection, and balance. However, the SOC-R's convergent factor validity was rather low in the present sample. Taken together, a high sense of coherence, and in particular a high manageability conviction, was observed as resilience factors for high-risk groups that are frequently exposed to potentially traumatic events.

"Linking psychophysiological adaptation, emotion regulation, and subjective stress to the occurrence of paranoia in daily life","Bahlinger, K.; Lincoln, T. M.; Krkovic, K.; Clamor, A.","As stress is relevant to the formation of paranoia, maladaptive behavioral and physiological stress regulation is discussed as a crucial indicator of vulnerability. This is supported by research linking psychosis to the tendency to make less use of functional and more use of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies (ER) and with a lower vagally-mediated heart rate variability (HRV). However, it remains unclear whether ER serves as a mediator between resting-state HRV on the one hand and subjective stress levels and paranoia on the other and whether this is specific to paranoia as compared to depression. We used an experience sampling method during seven days to repeatedly assess the experience of stress, usage of ER strategies, paranoia und depression (9/day) in a sample with subclinical positive symptoms (N = 32). Resting-state HRV was measured during a 5min interval in the laboratory. Data was analyzed by multi-level models. Higher resting-state HRV was predictive of lower stress-levels and of using more functional ER strategies (reappraisal, acceptance) in daily life, but did not predict the use of dysfunctional strategies (rumination, suppression) or paranoia. The association between resting-state HRV and stress was mediated by the usage of functional ER. Less functional and more dysfunctional ER were linked to higher levels of stress, paranoia and depression. Our study highlights that deficits in ER represent a link between psychophysiological and phenomenological aspects of paranoia but also of depression. This encourages to further investigate transdiagnostic prevention and therapy programs aiming to improve ER and to increase HRV.",2020,Nov,J Psychiatr Res,130,,152-159,32823048.0,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.021,,#137,Bahlinger 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Affective states contribute to trait reports of affective well-being,"Brose, A.; Lindenberger, U.; Schmiedek, F.","Asking people to provide global judgments, or trait reports, of their affective experience is a standard method for assessing trait affective well-being, with countless applications in the social sciences. Trait reports reflect numerous influences that generally go unnoticed. Although state affect is a highly plausible candidate for such influences, this source of unwanted variance does not receive much attention and is usually not controlled for in empirical studies. Using 100-day data from the COGITO study, we provide direct and strong evidence that trait reports of affect depend on how people feel at the time they provide the evaluations (i.e., their affective state). For example, participants experiencing more positive affect on a specific day relative to their individual mean also provide more positive ratings of their global affective experience. Furthermore, we found that current affect influences trait ratings in a surprisingly differentiated way--those particular facets of affect that are more/less prevalent at a certain moment are believed to occur more/less often in general. We stress the need for repeated observations within individuals to estimate state contributions to standard assessments of trait affect, to distinguish between state and trait in psychological assessment, and to achieve good indicators of affective experiences in the social and medical sciences.",2013,Oct,Emotion,13,5,940-8,23627720.0,10.1037/a0032401,,#138,Brose 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

The present technical report aims to solve this problem by evaluating the validity of, as well as agreement between the most commonly used immunoassays in psychoneuroendocrinological research (i.e., IBL, DRG, Salimetrics, DSL, and DELFIA) and a reference method (LC-MS/MS) in a sample of 195 saliva specimen covering the whole range of cortisol concentrations in adults. A structural equation modelling framework is applied to decompose systematic assay variance and estimate cortisol reference values, which are adjusted for measurement error and interference of salivary cortisone. Our findings reveal nonlinear relations between IAs and LC-MS/MS, which are discussed in terms of IA cross-reactivity with saliva matrix components. Finally guidelines for converting cortisol concentrations being obtained by these immunoassays into comparable reference values are proposed by providing conversion functions, a conversion table, and an online conversion tool.",2013,Jan,Psychoneuroendocrinology,38,1,50-7,22641005.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.04.019,,#139,Miller 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Make up your mind about food: A healthy mindset attenuates attention for high-calorie food in restrained eaters,"Werthmann, J.; Jansen, A.; Roefs, A.","Attention bias for food could be a cognitive pathway to overeating in obesity and restrained eating. Yet, empirical evidence for individual differences (e.g., in restrained eating and body mass index) in attention bias for food is mixed. We tested experimentally if temporarily induced health versus palatability mindsets influenced attention bias for food, and whether restrained eating moderated this relation. After manipulating mindset (health vs. palatability) experimentally, food-related attention bias was measured by eye-movements (EM) and response latencies (RL) during a visual probe task depicting high-calorie food and non-food. Restrained eating was assessed afterwards. A significant interaction of mindset and restrained eating on RL bias emerged, beta = 0.36, t(58) = 2.05, p = 0.045: A health mindset - as compared to a palatability mindset - attenuated attention bias for high-caloric food only in participants with higher eating restraint. No effects were observed on EM biases.

Impaired attention toward the eyes in psychopathic offenders: Evidence from an eye tracking study,"Gehrer, N.

Dysfunctions in such basic processes that guide the perception of social cues have been suggested to play a role in the development of psychopathy. The present study investigated gaze patterns in two groups of incarcerated psychopathic and non-psychopathic offenders. While recording their eye movements, participants were asked to categorize either gender (task 1) or emotional expression (task 2) of facial images. Psychopaths exhibited significantly reduced attention orienting toward the eyes, as indicated by absolute dwell time as well as frequency of the initial fixation on the eye region. This pattern was evident across all emotional expressions and independent of the task. The present results suggest a pervasive impairment to attention orienting toward the eyes in psychopaths compared to non-psychopathic offenders. This impairment appears to affect not only general attention but also early attention shifts.

Visual attention and sexual arousal in women with and without sexual dysfunction,"Velten, J.; Milani, S.; Margraf, J.; Brotto, L.

Attending to sexual cues is crucial for healthy sexual functioning. Studies suggest that sexual dysfunction is associated with less attention towards sexual stimuli. The goal of this study was to use an eye-tracking-based free-viewing paradigm to investigate whether women with sexual dysfunction visually attend to the genital area in dynamic sexual stimuli (i.e., erotic videos) differently than women with subclinical sexual function or those with typical sexual functioning. A total of 69 women (M(age) = 27.77, SD = 8.00) with clinical (n = 30), subclinical (n = 23), and typical (n = 16) levels of sexual functioning watched four 1-min video clips depicting heterosexual couples engaging in vaginal intercourse or cunnilingus while the total fixation duration on the genital area as well as their subjective and genital sexual arousal were recorded.

A longer total fixation duration on the genital area was followed by increases in subjective arousal and genital arousal. The relationship between attention and arousal was not moderated by sexual functioning group.

Attention orienting to the eyes in violent female and male offenders: An eye-tracking study,"Gehrer, N. A.; Zajenkowska, A.; Bodecka, M.; Schonenberg, M.","Attention to the eyes and eye contact form an important basis for the development of empathy and social competences including prosocial behavior. Thus, impairments in attention to the eyes of an interaction partner might play a role in the etiology of antisocial behavior and violence. For the first time, the present study extends investigations of eye gaze to a large sample (N = 173) including not only male but also female violent offenders and a control group. We assessed viewing patterns during the categorization of emotional faces via eye tracking. Our results indicate a reduced frequency of initial attention shifts to the eyes in female and male offenders compared to controls, while there were no general group differences in overall attention to the eye region (i.e., relative dwell time). Thus, we conclude that violent offenders might be able to compensate for deficits in spontaneous attention orienting during later stages of information processing.",2021,Jul,Biol Psychol,163,,108136,34129874.0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108136,,#148,Gehrer 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
ADHD symptoms are associated with the modular structure of intrinsic brain networks in a representative sample of healthy adults,"Hilger, K.; Fiebach, C. J.","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders with significant and often lifelong effects on social, emotional, and cognitive functioning. Influential neurocognitive models of ADHD link behavioral symptoms to altered connections between and within functional brain networks. Here, we investigate whether network-based theories of ADHD can be generalized to understanding variations in ADHD-related behaviors within the normal (i.e., clinically unaffected) adult population. In a large and representative sample, self-rated presence of ADHD symptoms varied widely; only 8 out of 291 participants scored in the clinical range. Subject-specific brain network graphs were modeled from functional MRI resting-state data and revealed significant associations between (nonclinical) ADHD symptoms and region-specific profiles of between-module and within-module connectivity. Effects were located in brain regions associated with multiple neuronal systems including the default-mode network, the salience network, and the central executive system. Our results are consistent with network perspectives of ADHD and provide further evidence for the relevance of an appropriate information transfer between task-negative (default-mode) and task-positive brain regions. More generally, our findings support a dimensional conceptualization of ADHD and contribute to a growing understanding of cognition as an emerging property of functional brain networks.",2019,2019/01,Netw Neurosci,3,2,567-588,31089485.0,10.1162/netn_a_00083,,#149,Hilger 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Approach bias retraining through virtual reality in smokers willing to quit smoking: A randomized-controlled study,"Machulska, A.; Eiler, T. J.; Kleinke, K.; Grunewald, A.; Bruck, R.; Jahn, K.; Niehaves, B.; Klucken, T.","Automatic approach biases toward smoking-related cues have been implicated in the development and maintenance of addictive behaviors. Studies aiming at modifying such biases have shown promise in changing maladaptive approach tendencies for smoking cues and reducing smoking behavior. However, training effects tend to be small and partly inconsistent. The present randomized-controlled trial incorporated virtual reality (VR) technology into Approach Bias Modification (ABM) to improve efficacy. One-hundred-eight smokers attended behavioral counseling for smoking cessation and were thereafter randomized to receive VR-ABM or VR-control training. During VR-ABM, participants trained to implicitly avoid smoking-related objects and to approach alternative objects, while no such contingency existed in the VR-control condition. Trainings were administered in six sessions within a two-week period. Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention (three weeks after baseline), and at follow-up (seven weeks after baseline). VR-ABM did not change approach biases, nor other cognitive biases, but it was superior in reducing daily smoking. However, this effect was limited to the two-week training period. Both groups improved in other smoking- and health-related variables across time. Future work should continue to investigate working mechanisms of ABM, in particular crucial training ingredients. VR could prove valuable for public health as the potential of VR-based treatments is large and not fully explored.",2021,Jun,Behav Res Ther,141,,103858,33862407.0,10.1016/j.brat.2021.103858,,#150,Machulska 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
What's in a face: Automatic facial coding of untrained study participants compared to standardized inventories,"Hofling, T. T. A.; Alpers, G. W.; Budenbender, B.; Fohl, U.; Gerdes, A. B. M.","Automatic facial coding (AFC) is a novel research tool to automatically analyze emotional facial expressions. AFC can classify emotional expressions with high accuracy in standardized picture inventories of intensively posed and prototypical expressions. However, classification of facial expressions of untrained study participants is more error prone. This discrepancy requires a direct comparison between these two sources of facial expressions. To this end, 70 untrained participants were asked to express joy, anger, surprise, sadness, disgust, and fear in a typical laboratory setting. Recorded videos were scored with a well-established AFC software (FaceReader, Noldus Information Technology). These were compared with AFC measures of standardized pictures from 70 trained actors (i.e., standardized inventories). We report the probability estimates of specific emotion categories and, in addition, Action Unit (AU) profiles for each emotion. Based on this, we used a novel machine learning approach to determine the relevant AUs for each emotion, separately for both datasets. First, misclassification was more frequent for some emotions of untrained participants. Second, AU intensities were generally lower in pictures of untrained participants compared to standardized pictures for all emotions. Third, although profiles of relevant AU overlapped substantially across the two data sets, there were also substantial differences in their AU profiles. This research provides evidence that the application of AFC is not limited to standardized facial expression inventories but can also be used to code facial expressions of untrained participants in a typical laboratory setting.",2022,2022/03/03,PLOS ONE,17,3,e0263863,35239654.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0263863,,#151,Hofling 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The Orienting Response in Healthy Aging: Novelty P3 Indicates No General Decline but Reduced Efficacy for Fast Stimulation Rates,"Berti, S.; Vossel, G.; Gamer, M.","Automatic orienting to unexpected changes in the environment is a pre-requisite for adaptive behavior. One prominent mechanism of automatic attentional control is the Orienting Response (OR). Despite the fundamental significance of the OR in everyday life, only little is known about how the OR is affected by healthy aging. We tested this question in two age groups (19-38 and 55-72 years) and measured skin-conductance responses (SCRs) and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to novels (i.e., short environmental sounds presented only once in the experiment; 10% of the trials) compared to standard sounds (600 Hz sinusoidal tones with 200 ms duration; 90% of the trials). Novel and standard stimuli were presented in four conditions differing in the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) with a mean ISI of either 10, 3, 1, or 0.5 s (blocked presentation). In both age groups, pronounced SCRs were elicited by novels in the 10 s ISI condition, suggesting the elicitation of stable ORs. These effects were accompanied by pronounced N1 and frontal P3 amplitudes in the ERP, suggesting that automatic novelty processing and orientation of attention are effective in both age groups. Furthermore, the SCR and ERP effects declined with decreasing ISI length. In addition, differences between the two groups were observable with the fastest presentation rates (i.e., 1 and 0.5 s ISI length). The most prominent difference was a shift of the peak of the frontal positivity from around 300 to 200 ms in the 19-38 years group while in the 55-72 years group the amplitude of the frontal P3 decreased linearly with decreasing ISI length. Taken together, this pattern of results does not suggest a general decline in processing efficacy with healthy aging. At least with very rare changes (here, the novels in the 10 s ISI condition) the OR is as effective in healthy older adults as in younger adults. With faster presentation rates, however, the efficacy of the OR decreases. This seems to result in a switch from novelty to deviant processing in younger adults, but less so in the group of older adults.",2017,2017/10/17,Front Psychol,8,,1780,29089907.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01780,,#152,Berti 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The Role of Sense of Voice Presence and Anxiety Reduction in AVATAR Therapy,"Rus-Calafell, M.; Ward, T.; Zhang, X. C.; Edwards, C. J.; Garety, P.; Craig, T.","AVATAR therapy offers a unique therapeutic context that uses virtual reality technology to create a virtual embodiment of the voice-hearing experience, enabling the person to visualize their persecutory voice and engage in real-time ""face-to-face"" dialogue. The present study explores, for the first time, the contribution of sense of voice presence, together with session-by-session reduction of anxiety and paranoid attributions about the avatar, to changes in primary outcomes following AVATAR therapy. Data from 39 participants, who completed AVATAR therapy and attended a 12-week follow-up assessment, were analysed. Mid- to high-levels of sense of voice presence were reported across the therapy sessions, along with significant reductions of anxiety levels and paranoid attributions about the avatar. The interaction of sense of voice presence and reduction of anxiety was associated with two of the significant therapy outcomes: PSYRATS total and frequency of voices. The findings suggest that improvements in voice severity and frequency at post AVATAR therapy may be influenced by the combination of feeling less anxious in the context of a realistic simulation of the voice, while voice-related distress may involve additional cognitive and relational processes.",2020,Aug 25,J Clin Med,9,9,2748,32854387.0,10.3390/jcm9092748,,#153,Rus-Calafell 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Early hypervigilance and later avoidance: Event-related potentials track the processing of threatening stimuli in anxiety,"Kausche, F. M.; Harpfer, K.; Carsten, H. P.; Kathmann, N.; Riesel, A.","Avoidance behavior is a core symptom of anxiety disorders that may hinder adaptation. Anxiety disorders are heterogeneous and previous research suggests to decompose anxiety into two dimensions: anxious apprehension and anxious arousal. How these two dimensions are associated with avoidance of and exposure to threatening stimuli, as well as their accompanying neural processes, is barely understood. We examined threat processing using event-related potentials (N1, LPP) from 134 individuals considering the influence of anxiety dimensions. During a two-phase picture-viewing task the participants watched neutral and threatening pictures, which they were instructed to either avoid or attend to during repeated presentations. Results showed that threatening compared to neutral pictures were associated with increased attention allocation (N1) and in-depth processing (LPP), modulated by task-instructions (lower during avoidance). Further, increased anxious apprehension was associated with heightened automatic attention (increased N1), followed by reduced LPP amplitudes for threatening pictures suggesting reduced in-depth processing. During re-exposure, threatening pictures were associated with increased in-depth processing, with no difference between previously avoided and maintained pictures. Together, these results illustrate that avoidance and high anxious apprehension seem to lead to similar neural changes in the processing of aversive images that may conflict with long-term adaptation.",2022,Nov,Behav Res Ther,158,,104181,36087438.0,10.1016/j.brat.2022.104181,,#154,Kausche 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Costly habitual avoidance is reduced by concurrent goal-directed approach in a modified devaluation paradigm,"Gluck, V. M.; Zwosta, K.; Wolfensteller, U.; Ruge, H.; Pittig, A.","Avoidance habits potentially contribute to maintaining maladaptive, costly avoidance behaviors that persist in the absence of threat. However, experimental evidence about costly habitual avoidance is scarce. In two experiments, we tested whether extensively trained avoidance impairs the subsequent goal-directed approach of rewards. Healthy participants were extensively trained to avoid an aversive outcome by performing simple responses to distinct full-screen color stimuli. After the subsequent devaluation of the aversive outcome, participants received monetary rewards for correct responses to neutral object pictures, which were presented on top of the same full-screen colors. These approach responses were either compatible or incompatible with habitual avoidance responses. Notably, the full-screen colors were not relevant to inform approach responses. In Experiment 1, participants were not instructed about post-devaluation stimulus-response-reward contingencies. Accuracy was lower in habit-incompatible than in habit-compatible trials, indicating costly avoidance, whereas reaction times did not differ. In Experiment 2, contingencies were explicitly instructed. Accuracy differences disappeared, but reaction times were slower in habit-incompatible than in habit-compatible trials, indicating low-cost habitual avoidance tendencies. These findings suggest a small but consistent impact of habitual avoidance tendencies on subsequent goal-directed approach. Costly habitual responding could, however, be inhibited when competing goal-directed approach was easily realizable.",2021,Nov,Behav Res Ther,146,,103964,34547635.0,10.1016/j.brat.2021.103964,,#155,Gluck 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Incentive-based, instructed, and social observational extinction of avoidance: Fear-opposite actions and their influence on fear extinction","Pittig, A.; Wong, A. H. K.","Avoidance is a transdiagnostic symptom of clinical anxiety and its reduction a major focus of cognitive-behavioral treatments. This study examined the instrumental extinction of goal-directed avoidance by means of incentives, verbal instruction, and social observation and their influence on fear extinction. Participants acquired conditioned fear and instrumental avoidance responses (N = 160). In four randomized groups, the reduction of avoidance by incentives for non-avoidance, instructions to refrain from avoidance, and social observation of non-avoidance was compared to no intervention before removing the aversive outcome. Conditioned fear when avoidance became unavailable subsequently was tested. Incentives, instruction, and observation all reduced avoidance better than no intervention, however, with different degrees and influence on conditioned fear. Incentives and instructions strongly reduced avoidance despite high levels of fear (i.e., fear-opposite actions). This initiated fear extinction, thereby reducing conditioned fear when avoidance became unavailable. Social observation directly reduced conditioned fear, presumably because it conveyed additional information about the absence of the aversive outcome. However, observation only moderately reduced avoidance and resulted in higher fear when avoidance became unavailable. The effects of social observation may depend on the nuances of the demonstrator's behavior. The clear effects of incentive and instructions provide support for clinical interventions to reduce avoidance during exposure therapy and can serve as experimental models for their controlled investigation.",2021,Feb,Behav Res Ther,137,,103797,33429135.0,10.1016/j.brat.2020.103797,,#156,Pittig 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Implicit approach and avoidance in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Cludius, B.; Kulz, A. K.; Landmann, S.; Moritz, S.; Wittekind, C. E.","Avoidance is regarded as an important feature for the development and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and is usually assessed using explicit measures such as self-report scales. However, some behavioral schemata are unavailable to introspection, making them partially inaccessible by explicit measures. We used an approach-avoidance task (AAT) as an implicit measure to examine behavioral tendencies in patients with OCD, including patients with checking- and contamination-related symptoms (n = 63), compared with a healthy control group (n = 30). Participants were asked to respond to the color of a stimulus or stimulus frame by pulling a joystick toward themselves or by pushing it away. The stimuli were comprised of checking-related, contamination-related, and neutral pictures and words. Patients with contamination-related symptoms were slower when responding to OCD-related stimuli, independent of approach or avoidance. Unexpectedly, patients with checking-related symptoms were faster at pulling (approaching) and slower at pushing (avoiding) checking-related material compared with neutral stimuli. The slower pushing (avoiding) of checking-related compared with neutral material correlated positively with explicit ratings of avoidance. These results suggest a biased approach-avoidance tendency in patients with checking-related symptoms of OCD, but not in those with contamination-related symptoms of OCD. Future studies are necessary to assess whether the AAT might be useful in the assessment of treatment gains as well as whether it might be a training tool to enhance psychotherapeutic changes in OCD.

"Relationships between addictive Facebook use, depressiveness, insomnia, and positive mental health in an inpatient sample: A German longitudinal study","Brailovskaia, J.; Rohmann, E.; Bierhoff, H. W.; Margraf, J.; Kollner, V.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Individuals with high level of negative mental health often tend to use the social platform Facebook to escape from daily stress. They are at risk to develop an emotional bond to Facebook linked to a need to stay permanently online. The current work investigated addictive use of Facebook and its conceptual framework in clinical context. METHODS: In a longitudinal study design, duration of daily use of Facebook, addictive Facebook use, depressiveness, insomnia, and positive mental health (PMH) were assessed in a sample of 349 inpatients [M(age) (SD(age)) = 50.13 (9.41)] of a psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic in Germany over a period of on average 6 weeks. RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that duration of daily Facebook use at the first measurement time point (T1) served as significant positive predictor of addictive Facebook use at the second measurement time point (T2). Addictive Facebook use (T1) significantly positively predicted depressiveness and insomnia (T2). Its prediction of PMH (T2) was significantly negative. Mediation analyses showed that PMH (T1) partially mediated the association between addictive Facebook use (T1) and depressiveness (T2), and fully mediated the relationship between addictive Facebook use (T1) and insomnia (T2). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Current longitudinal results indicate that addictive Facebook use might negatively impact the recovery process of inpatients. Thus, it might be relevant to assess and consider addictive Facebook use in the clinical context. Therapeutic interventions are suggested to focus on the enhancement of inpatients' PMH level, which may buffer the negative effect of problematic Facebook use.",2019,Dec 1,J Behav Addict,8,4,703-713,31830811.0,10.1556/2006.8.2019.63,,#160,Brailovskaia 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
The role of inhibitory control and decision-making in the course of Internet gaming disorder,"Kraplin, A.; Scherbaum, S.; Kraft, E. M.; Rehbein, F.; Buhringer, G.; Goschke, T.; Mossle, T.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is associated with impaired inhibitory control and more impulsive decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether these associations are cross-sectional or predictive. We aimed to test the hypotheses that lower inhibitory control and more impulsive decision-making correlate with, are predicted by and predict more time spent on gaming and higher IGD severity. METHODS: A stratified convenience sample of 70 male participants (18-21 years) was recruited to achieve broad data variability for hours spent on gaming and IGD severity. In three annual assessments (T1, T2, T3), we measured gaming behaviour and IGD severity using the Video Game Dependency Scale (CSAS-II). Both gaming-related measures were correlates (T1), predictors (T2), or outcomes (T3) of inhibitory control and decision making, which were assessed at T2 using a go/no-go task and an intertemporal-choice task, respectively. RESULTS: Higher IGD severity at T1 predicted more impulsive decision-making at T2 (beta = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.14-0.76). Lower inhibitory control at T2 predicted more hours spent on gaming at T3 (beta = -0.13, 95% CI = -0.25 to -0.02). We found weak or no evidence for the other associations. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Lower inhibitory control predicts more time spent gaming, possibly due to insufficient top-down regulation of the behaviour. Impulsive decision-making is rather a consequence of IGD than a predictor, which may be due to altered reward learning. One-dimensional etiological assumptions about the relationship between neurocognitive impairments and IGD seem not to be appropriate for the complexity of the disorder.",2020,Oct 31,J Behav Addict,9,4,990-1001,33136066.0,10.1556/2006.2020.00076,,#161,Kraplin 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Individual cortisol response to acute stress influences neural processing of sexual cues,"Stark, R.; Markert, C.; Kruse, O.; Walter, B.; Strahler, J.; Klein, S.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Problematic pornography use can be conceptualized as an impulse control disorder or alternatively as a behavioral addiction. Stress is an important trigger in addiction, but less is known about the neural effect of stress in problematic pornography use. Therefore, we aimed at investigating the effect of stress during the anticipation and viewing of sexually explicit material while considering person characteristics related to potentially being at risk for developing problematic pornography use. METHODS: In an fMRI study (n = 157 men, age: mean = 25.46, SD = 4.11) we used a sexual incentive delay task. A social stress test was used to induce stress in half of the participants. Salivary cortisol was repeatedly measured and person characteristics were considered moderating the effects of cortisol response. RESULTS: We found no group differences in the neural responses during the anticipation phase, but a higher reactivity to sexual stimuli in the dACC in the stress group. Acute stress activated a pronounced cortisol response, which positively correlated with neural activations in the reward system (NAcc, dACC) to sexual cues. Further, the individual time spent on pornography use moderated the effect of cortisol in some regions of the reward system (dACC, mOFC). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that acute stress related increases in cortisol can enhance the incentive value of cues announcing sexual stimuli. This might explain why acute stress is considered a trigger of pornography use and relapse and why individual stress response might be a risk factor for developing a problematic pornography use.",2022,Jul 13,J Behav Addict,11,2,506-519,35895611.0,10.1556/2006.2022.00037,,#162,Stark 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Are Drinking Motives Universal? Characteristics of Motive Types in Alcohol-Dependent Men from Two Diverse Populations,"Ertl, V.; Preusse, M.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Since alcohol use disorders are among the most prevalent and destructive mental disorders, it is critical to address factors contributing to their development and maintenance. Drinking motives are relevant driving factors for consumption. Identifying groups of drinkers with similar motivations may help to specialize intervention components and make treatment more effective and efficient. We aimed to identify and describe distinct motive types of drinkers in dependent males from two diverse cultures (Uganda and Germany) and to explore potential differences and similarities in addiction-related measures. Moreover, we investigated specific links between motive types and childhood maltreatment, traumatic experiences, and symptoms of comorbid psychopathologies. METHODS: To determine distinct drinking motive types, we conducted latent class analyses concerning drinking motives (Drinking Motive Scale) in samples of treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent men (N = 75). Subsequently we compared the identified motive types concerning their alcohol consumption and alcohol-related symptoms (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), history of childhood maltreatment (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), trauma exposure (Violence, War and Abduction Exposure Scale), psychopathology (Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, Depression-section of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and Brief Symptom Inventory) and deficits in emotion regulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale). RESULTS: We found two congruent drinking motive types in both contexts. Reward-oriented drinking motives like the generation of positive feelings and enhancing performance were endorsed almost equally by both motive types, whereas high relief motive endorsement characterized one group, but not the other. The relief motive type drank to overcome aversive feelings, withdrawal, and daily hassles and was characterized by higher adversity in general. Emotional maltreatment in childhood and psychopathological symptoms were reported to a significantly greater extent by relief drinkers (effect sizes of comparisons ranging from r = 0.25 to r = 0.48). However, the motive types did not differ significantly on alcohol consumption or alcohol-related symptoms and traumatic experiences apart from childhood maltreatment. CONCLUSION: The chronology of addiction development and patterns of drinking motivation seem to be similar across cultures, i.e., that motive targeting interventions might be applicable cross-culturally. Addressing comorbid symptomatology should be a key treatment component for relief drinkers, whereas finding alternatives for the creation of positive feelings and ways to counteract boredom and inactivity should be a general treatment element.",2018,2018/02/13,Front Psychiatry,9,,38,29487544.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00038,,#164,Ertl 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Sexual incentive delay in the scanner: Sexual cue and reward processing, and links to problematic porn consumption and sexual motivation","Markert, C.; Klein, S.; Strahler, J.; Kruse, O.; Stark, R.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The use of pornography, while unproblematic for the majority, can grow into addiction-like behavior which in its extreme form is labeled as compulsive sexual behavioral disorder in the ICD-11 (WHO, 2018). The aim of this study was to investigate the addiction-specific reactivity to cues in order to better understand underlying mechanisms in the development of this disorder. METHODS: We have used an optimized Sexual Incentive Delay Task to study brain activity in reward associated brain areas during an anticipation phase (with cues predicting pornographic videos, control videos or no videos) and a corresponding delivery phase in healthy men. Correlations to indicators of problematic pornography use, the time spent on pornography use, and trait sexual motivation were analyzed. RESULTS: The results of 74 men showed that reward-related brain areas (amygdala, dorsal cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and insula) were significantly more activated by both the pornographic videos and the pornographic cues than by control videos and control cues, respectively. However, we found no relationship between these activations and indicators of problematic pornography use, time spent on pornography use, or with trait sexual motivation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The activity in reward-related brain areas to both visual sexual stimuli as well as cues indicates that optimization of the Sexual Incentive Delay Task was successful.

Recovery After Stress-Autonomic and Subjective Arousal in Individuals With Psychosis Compared to Healthy Controls,"Bahlinger, K.; Lincoln, T. M.; Clamor, A.","BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Heightened stress levels in individuals with psychosis (PSY) are associated with psychotic symptom occurrence and may be partially attributed to well-established deficits in resting-state heart rate variability (HRV) and emotion regulation. In healthy participants, resting-state HRV and self-reported emotion regulation skills have been linked to recovery after a stressor; however, it is unclear whether stress recovery is altered in PSY. Thus, we compared the autonomic and subjective recovery of PSY to healthy controls (HC) and investigated the predictive value of resting-state HRV and emotion regulation skills. STUDY DESIGN: We assessed resting-state HRV and self-reported emotion regulation one week prior to a combined physical and cognitive stress induction. After the stress exposure, we assessed the autonomic (decrease in heart rate [HR], increase in HRV) and subjective (decrease in subjective stress and negative affect) recovery in PSY (n = 50) and HC (n = 50) over 60 min. STUDY RESULTS: Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed the expected interaction of time x group for subjective stress but not negative affect or autonomic stress. Resting-state HRV predicted recovery of HR, and emotion regulation skills predicted recovery of HRV but not of the other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Although subjective stress recovery was delayed in PSY, the absence of autonomic recovery deficits suggests that a prolonged stress response may not contribute to heightened stress levels to the expected extent. Improving resting-state HRV and emotion regulation may support autonomic recovery, but further investigation is required to test the impact of such improvements on psychotic symptoms.",2022,Nov 18,Schizophr Bull,48,6,1373-1383,35998116.0,10.1093/schbul/sbac097,,#166,Bahlinger 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Responses to stress in patients with psychotic disorders compared to persons with varying levels of vulnerability to psychosis, persons with depression and healthy controls","Lincoln, T. M.; Kother, U.; Hartmann, M.; Kempkensteffen, J.; Moritz, S.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: An experimental design was used to test whether self-reported, psychophysiological and symptomatic stress-responses increase as a function of the underlying vulnerability to psychosis as proposed by vulnerability-stress-models. METHODS: Stress-responses of participants with psychotic disorders (PSY, n = 35) were compared to those of participants with attenuated positive symptoms (AS, n = 29), first-degree relatives of persons with psychotic disorders (REL, n = 26), healthy controls (HC, n = 28) and controls with depression (DEP, n = 30). Using a repeated measures design, participants were assigned to a noise stressor, a social stressor and a no stress condition in random order. Stress-responses were assessed via self-report, salivary cortisol levels, heart rate and skin conductance levels. State-paranoia and depression were assessed with clinical scales. RESULTS: PSY reported to be significantly more stressed than HC, AS and REL across all conditions which went along with increased heart rate and decreased overall cortisol release. In contrast, AS showed elevated levels of cortisol. PSY showed a stronger response of self-reported stress to the noise condition compared to the no stress condition than HC, but no stronger response than the other samples. Furthermore, the stressors did not trigger stronger psychophysiological responses or symptom-increases in PSY. LIMITATIONS: The social stressor was brief and not individualized and did not have an effect on cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the notion that subjective stress-responsiveness increases with vulnerability, but not the assumption that symptoms arise directly as a function of stress and vulnerability. Also, the generally high levels of arousal seem to be more relevant to psychosis than the responsiveness to specific stressors.",2015,Jun,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,47,,92-101,25506818.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2014.11.011,,#168,Lincoln 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Avoidance of all feedback? Attention allocation during and after public speech in social anxiety,"Lin, M.; Qian, M.; He, D.; Wen, X.; Li, X.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Attention avoidance of feedback-related stimuli is proposed to be associated with and maintain social anxiety. However, previous research has mainly focused on comparing the attention bias between two types of stimuli, while little is known about attention distribution patterns among positive, neutral, and negative feedback and non-feedback stimuli in individuals with high trait social anxiety (HSA) or low trait social anxiety (LSA). METHODS: The current study assessed eye movement pattern of participants with HSA or LSA during a speech task (high anxiety condition) or while solely watching audience feedback of the speech (low anxiety condition). A pre-recorded audience who displayed approving, neutral, or disapproving gestures was presented as feedback stimuli, while neutral facial photos were used as non-feedback stimuli. RESULTS: Only in the high anxiety condition, participants with HSA exhibited longer total fixation on non-feedback stimuli compared to those with LSA; whereas in the low anxiety condition, both groups paid more attention to emotional feedback stimuli. LIMITATIONS: The final sample size was modest due to a high suspicion rate of the reality of the audience. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that only in highly anxious social situations, socially anxious individuals lack the attentional preference toward positive feedback that individuals with low anxious have.",2020,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,66,,101520,31675486.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2019.101520,,#169,Lin 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Performance in a blocked versus randomized emotional Stroop task in an aged, early traumatized group with and without posttraumatic stress symptoms","Wittekind, C. E.; Muhtz, C.; Moritz, S.; Jelinek, L.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Attentional biases (AB) for trauma-related stimuli have been examined in many studies assessing different trauma samples. In emotional Stroop tasks (EST), blocked and single-trial formats are used almost interchangeably in clinical research. There is reason to believe that different designs yield different results and assess different processes, which, however, has been hardly examined in studies. Furthermore, there is a dearth of information about AB in older trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress symptoms. METHODS: Older adults with (n = 20) and without PTSD symptoms (n = 26) as well as non-traumatized controls (n = 21) completed an EST, in which words were presented both blocked and randomized. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that individuals with PTSD symptoms showed AB for trauma- and depression-related words; however, mode of administration did not significantly influence reaction times. LIMITATIONS: The emotional Stroop task cannot disentangle the underlying cognitive mechanism (i.e., facilitation, interference, avoidance). CONCLUSIONS: PTSD symptoms in older trauma survivors are associated with AB. Overall, participants with PTSD symptoms did not show greater impairment of cognitive control in comparison to both control groups. Results also illustrate that methodological differences between task versions need to be considered more thoroughly.",2017,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,54,,35-43,27308725.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2016.06.003,,#170,Wittekind 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Is trait resilience characterized by specific patterns of attentional bias to emotional stimuli and attentional control?,"Schafer, J.; Wittchen, H. U.; Hofler, M.; Heinrich, A.; Zimmermann, P.; Siegel, S.; Schonfeld, S.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Attentional processes have been suggested to play a crucial role in resilience defined as positive adaptation facing adversity. However, research is lacking on associations between attentional biases to positive and threat-related stimuli, attentional control and trait resilience. METHODS: Data stem from the follow-up assessment of a longitudinal study investigating mental health and related factors among German soldiers. Trait resilience was assessed with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and attentional control with the Attentional Control Scale. A subset of n = 198 soldiers also completed a dot probe task with happy, neutral and threatening faces. RESULTS: Attentional control was positively related to trait resilience. Results revealed no associations between both attentional biases and trait resilience. However, there was a negative association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was low and a positive association between attentional bias to threat and trait resilience when attentional control was high. No such associations were found for attentional bias to positive stimuli. LIMITATIONS: Generalizability to other populations may be limited since we exclusively focused on male soldiers. Also, the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that attentional processing may promote trait resilience.

Guided reactivation of personal phobic memories prior to exposure exercises prevents the renewal of fear responses in subjects with claustrophobic fears,"Hollandt, M.; Richter, J.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Basic research suggest behavioral strategies for interferencing the reconsolidation of fear memories to be a promising approach in reducing clinical fears. However, first clinical studies revealed mixed results highlighting the need to identify boundary conditions. We experimentally tested the specific hypothesis that post-retrieval threat exposure prevents context renewal usually observed in protocols without fear memory reactivation. METHODS: In a preliminary investigation forty-three individuals with claustrophobic fears reactivated the individual phobic memory or not during a guided emotional imagery task and then performed standardized threat exposure to provide new information for updating the original memory. During retests seven and 28 days later, the context was different from that during treatment in half of the subjects. RESULTS: In those who were guided, the fear memory was successfully reactivated as indexed by increased skin conductance level (SCL) during the imagery of personal scenes relative to neutral scenes. During retests the subjects of the memory non-activation group showed a return of reported fear after context change that, however, was not observed after post-retrieval exposure. In line, autonomic arousal (SCL) decreased over time in the memory reactivation group only if the context changed during retest. LIMITATIONS: Limited sample size and the inclusion of an analog sample reduce the generalizability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The reactivation of fear memory prior to treatment through guided imagery of past personal phobic situations prevented contextual renewal of phobic fears which was observed in those subjects without reactivation of memory.",2022,Dec,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,77,,101767,36113904.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2022.101767,,#172,Hollandt 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Body-related cognitions, affect and post-event processing in body dysmorphic disorder","Kollei, I.; Martin, A.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive behavioural models postulate that individuals with BDD engage in negative appearance-related appraisals and affect. External representations of one's appearance are thought to activate a specific mode of processing characterized by increased self-focused attention and an activation of negative appraisals and affect. METHODS: The present study used a think-aloud approach including an in vivo body exposure to examine body-related cognitions and affect in individuals with BDD (n = 30), as compared to individuals with major depression (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 30). Participants were instructed to think aloud during baseline, exposure and follow-up trials. RESULTS: Individuals with BDD verbalized more body-related and more negative body-related cognitions during all trials and reported higher degrees of negative affect than both control groups. A weaker increase of positive body-related cognitions during exposure, a stronger increase of sadness and anger after exposure and higher levels of post-event processing, were specific processes in individuals with BDD. LIMITATIONS: Individuals with major depression were not excluded from the BDD group. This is associated with a reduction of internal validity, as the two clinical groups are somewhat interwoven. Key findings need to be replicated. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that outcomes such as negative appearance-related cognitions and affect are specific to individuals with BDD. An external representation of one's appearance activates a specific mode of processing in BDD, manifesting itself in the absence of positive body-related cognitions, increased anger and sadness, and high levels of post-event processing. These specific processes may contribute toward maintenance of BDD psychopathology.",2014,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,45,1,144-51,24158009.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.09.005,,#173,Kollei 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Implicit aggressiveness in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder as assessed by an Implicit Association Test,"Cludius, B.; Schmidt, A. F.; Moritz, S.; Banse, R.; Jelinek, L.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) highlight the role of cognitive biases for the development of the disorder. One of these biases, an inflated sense of responsibility has been associated with higher anger scores and latent aggression on self-report scales, especially in patients with compulsive checking. Validity of self-report assessment is, however, compromised by inaccuracy, social desirability, and low metacognitive awareness of traits and behaviors in patients. The aim of the present study was to extend the research on latent aggression in individuals with OCD by using an indirect, implicit measure of aggression. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with OCD and 25 healthy controls were assessed with an Aggressiveness-Implicit Association Test (IAT), which is a reaction time task that assesses the strength of associations between the concept of ""aggressiveness"" and ""me"" compared to others. RESULTS: Contrary to our expectation, OCD patients with checking symptoms showed a more peaceful implicit self-concept than healthy controls. This result was corroborated by negative correlations between checking symptoms and implicit aggressiveness in the OCD sample. LIMITATIONS: No self-report measures on aggression or anger were included in the study. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to previous research using self-report measures, our study indicates that implicit aspects of aggression do indeed differ from controlled aspects in patients with checking compulsions.

Cognitive restructuring and imagery modification for posttraumatic stress disorder (CRIM-PTSD): A pilot study,"Muller-Engelmann, M.; Steil, R.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive restructuring and imagery modification for PTSD (CRIM-PTSD) is a new short intervention. It consists of the cognitive restructuring of core trauma-related dysfunctional beliefs about the self and the use of imagery to encourage more functional beliefs. A randomized controlled trial showed that CRIM was effective for reducing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) when it focused on the feeling of being contaminated. For this study, CRIM was adapted to treat PTSD symptoms more generally and after various types of trauma by addressing the patients' negative self-concept. METHODS: Ten patients with PTSD received two assessment sessions, two treatment sessions, and a booster session. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was administered prior to and four weeks after treatment. Self-ratings, e.g., the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), were administered at baseline, immediately posttreatment, and four weeks after treatment. RESULTS: The participants showed significant improvements in both clinician-rated (d = 2.55; p < 0.01) and self-reported PTSD symptoms (d = 1.47; p < 0.01). One month after treatment, 9 patients no longer fully met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. LIMITATIONS: The results are limited by the small sample size and the lack of a control group.

The relation between generalized anxiety disorder symptoms and content-specific interpretation biases for auditory stimuli in children,"Klein, A. M.; Bakens, R.; van Niekerk, R. E.; Ouwens, M. A.; Rapee, R. M.; Bogels, S. M.; Becker, E. S.; Rinck, M.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive theories of fear suggest that biases in interpretation are content-specific: Fearful children should only interpret materials negatively if they are specifically related to the content of their fear. So far, there are only a few studies available that report on this postulated content-specificity of interpretation processes in childhood fear. The goal of this study was to examine interpretation bias and its content-specificity in children with varying levels of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms. METHODS: In an Auditory Interpretation Task (AIT), two words that differ by one phoneme are acoustically blended so that one can hear only one of the words. In the current AIT, we included GAD-related blends, negatively-valenced fear-related blends and positive blends. Multiple-choice (n = 371) or open-ended (n = 295) responses were collected from 666 nonclinical children between 7 and 13 years of age. RESULTS: Children with higher levels of self-reported GAD showed significantly more negative interpretations of ambiguous GAD-related blends in the multiple-choice version than children with lower levels of GAD. There were no differences when interpreting the other ambiguous blends. This result was not found with the open-ended version. LIMITATIONS: Effects were relatively small, some GAD-stimuli were sub-optimal, and the task was administered in a classroom setting. Even though we ensured that all children were able to hear all words clearly, this may have impacted the results.

However, little is known about the interrelations of cognitive bias tasks and whether they allow for an improved prediction of fear-related behavior in addition to self-reports. This study simultaneously addressed several types of cognitive biases in children, to investigate attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias and fear-related associations, their interrelations and the prediction of behavior. METHODS: Eighty-one children varying in their levels of spider fear completed the Spider Anxiety and Disgust Screening for Children and performed two Emotional Stroop tasks, a Free Recall task, an interpretation task including size and distance indication, an Affective Priming Task, and a Behavioral Assessment Test. RESULTS: We found an attention bias, interpretation bias, and fear-related associations, but no evidence for a memory bias. The biases showed little overlap. Attention bias, interpretation bias, and fear-related associations predicted unique variance in avoidance of spiders. Interpretation bias and fear-related associations remained significant predictors, even when self-reported fear was included as a predictor. LIMITATIONS: Children were not seeking help for their spider fear and were not tested on clinical levels of spider phobia.

The Influence of Alcohol on Rumination and Metacognitions in Major Depressive Disorder,"Gawron, L.; Pohl, A.; Gerlach, A. L.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Comorbidity between major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent but reasons for this association are unclear. Rumination may activate metacognitive beliefs that contribute to the development and maintenance of rumination and depression. Negative metacognitions can further lead to other dysfunctional coping strategies (i.e., consumption of alcohol). We examined whether alcohol reduces (state) metacognitions, rumination and other disorder-specific processes in a group of individuals suffering from MDD. METHOD: In an experiment with three randomized conditions we investigated whether the consumption of alcohol, placebo or no alcohol (orange juice) affects (meta-)cognitions, depressive symptoms and / or psychophysiological variables while participants ruminate. RESULTS: Voluntary rumination increased self-reported sadness, tension and rumination, tensed facial muscles and increased heart rate, but did not affect (state) metacognitions and heart rate variability. The consumption of alcohol did not influence rumination, metacognitions, depressive or psychophysiological measures. LIMITATIONS: We recruited a depressed population but excluded pathological alcohol use due to ethical considerations. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that alcohol consumption affects rumination, metacognitions and other disorder-specific processes in MDD.

"Body dysmorphic concerns, social adaptation, and motivation for psychotherapeutic support in dermatological outpatients","Ritter, V.; Fluhr, J. W.; Schliemann-Willers, S.; Elsner, P.; Strauss, B.; Stangier, U.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dermatologists are increasingly confronted with patients affected by body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). BDD is characterized by excessive preoccupation with one or more perceived defect(s) or flaw(s) in physical appearance which are not observable or appear slight to others. So far, there have been only few studies examining the prevalence of BDD in dermatological outpatients. In addition, the need for psychotherapeutic support in dermatological outpatients with body dysmorphic concerns has not yet been systematically examined. The objective of the present study was therefore to investigate the frequency of body dysmorphic concerns as well as social adaptation and the need for psychotherapeutic support in the aforementioned patient group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 252 dermatological outpatients seen at a German university hospital were consecutively enrolled, and examined using the Dysmorphic Concerns Questionnaire, the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale, and the German version of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale. RESULTS: 7.9 % of all outpatients (unselected sample) showed positive test results, suggesting clinically relevant body dysmorphic concerns. Patients with clinically relevant body dysmorphic concerns exhibited poor social adaptation.

The Bi-factor model of repetitive negative thinking: Common vs. unique factors as predictors of depression and anxiety,"Funk, J.; Takano, K.; Schumm, H.; Ehring, T.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Different forms of repetitive negative thinking (RNT) have traditionally been conceptualized as being distinctly linked to specific disorders. However, emerging evidence suggests that a common process lies at the core of different RNT manifestations. This common process might also largely explain the link between RNT and psychopathology. To examine the latent factor structure of RNT, we compared three structural-equation models, assuming (a) a common factor across different RNT measures (single-factor model); (b) scale-specific factors for each RNT measures (separate-factor model); and (c) both a common and scale-specific factors (bi-factor model). We additionally tested whether these latent factors predicted depression and anxiety at a follow-up time-point. METHODS: A community sample (N = 523) completed an online assessment comprising measures of rumination, worry and content-independent RNT as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms at baseline (t1) and three months later (t2). RESULTS: The bi-factor model showed the best fit to the data among the three models. Moreover, the common factor of the bi-factor model significantly predicted depression and anxiety three months later. Next to the common factor, some but not all scale-specific factors additionally predicted symptoms. LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted in a non-clinical sample and the assessment of psychopathology was restricted to depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Repetitive negative thinking: transdiagnostic correlate and risk factor for mental disorders? A proof-of-concept study in German soldiers before and after deployment to Afghanistan,"Hummel, K. V.; Trautmann, S.; Venz, J.; Thomas, S.; Schafer, J.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Disorder-specific forms of Repetitive Negative Thinking (RNT) are associated with multiple diagnostic categories, indicating a transdiagnostic nature. Few studies examined content-independent RNT processes across groups of diagnosed mental disorders. Moreover, theory describes RNT processes as critically involved in the etiology of mental disorders, empirical evidence however is scarce. We first tested the transdiagnostic nature by examining levels of RNT across groups of internalizing and externalizing mental disorders compared to healthy individuals and explored RNT levels in a comorbid disorder-group. Second, we examined whether RNT predicts incident psychopathology. METHODS: In a sample of German soldiers (n = 425) scheduled for deployment in Afghanistan, we compared RNT levels between diagnosed groups with alcohol use disorders, anxiety disorders and healthy individuals cross-sectionally. Exploratory analyses were conducted comparing a comorbid disorder-group to healthy individuals and to both single-disorder-groups. Longitudinally, we examined the predictive value of pre-deployment RNT levels for incident psychopathology after deployment (n = 167). RNT was measured using the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ), DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed using the standardized Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). RESULTS: Cross-sectional comparisons revealed that soldiers with alcohol use disorders and anxiety disorders showed significantly higher degrees of RNT compared to healthy soldiers. RNT levels in those with comorbid disorders were significantly higher compared to healthy soldiers but also compared to both single-disorder-groups. Longitudinal analyses revealed that higher levels of RNT prior to deployment were associated with a higher risk to have any incidental mental disorder after deployment.

Reducing analogue trauma symptoms by computerized reappraisal training - considering a cognitive prophylaxis?,"Woud, M. L.; Postma, P.; Holmes, E. A.; Mackintosh, B.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Distressing intrusions are a hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dysfunctional appraisal of these symptoms may exacerbate the disorder, and conversely may lead to further intrusive memories. This raises the intriguing possibility that learning to 'reappraise' potential symptoms more functionally may protect against such symptoms. Woud, Holmes, Postma, Dalgleish, and Mackintosh (2012) found that 'reappraisal training' when delivered after an analogue stressful event reduced later intrusive memories and other posttraumatic symptoms. The present study aimed to investigate whether reappraisal training administered before a stressful event is also beneficial. METHODS: Participants first received positive or negative reappraisal training (CBM-App training) using a series of scripted vignettes. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a film with traumatic content. Effects of the CBM-App training procedure were assessed via three distinct outcome measures, namely: (a) post-training appraisals of novel ambiguous vignettes, (b) change scores on the Post Traumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), and (c) intrusive symptom diary. RESULTS: CBM-App training successfully induced training-congruent appraisal styles. Moreover, those trained positively reported less distress arising from their intrusive memories of the trauma film during the subsequent week than those trained negatively. However, the induced appraisal bias only partly affected PTCI scores. LIMITATIONS: Participants used their own negative event as a reference for the PTCI assessments. The events may have differed regarding their emotional impact. There was no control group. CONCLUSIONS: CBM-App training has also some beneficial effects when applied before a stressful event and may serve as a cognitive prophylaxis against trauma-related symptomatology.",2013,Sep,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,44,3,312-5,23454552.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.01.003,,#183,Woud 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Body-related attentional biases in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder resulting from childhood sexual abuse with and without co-occurring borderline personality disorder,"Witthoft, M.; Borgmann, E.; White, A.; Dyer, A.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Disturbed body perception is a common characteristic of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childhood sexual abuse (CSA). We examined the extent to which biased information processing of body related stimuli was related to CSA. METHODS: Patients with PTSD after CSA (PTSD group; n = 61) were compared to healthy controls (HC group; n = 30). The PTSD group was subdivided into patients with comorbid Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD; PTSD+ group) and patients without BPD (PTSD-group). We used an emotional Stroop task (EST) with body-related words to assess biased information processing. RESULTS: Only patients in the PTSD+ group but not in the PTSD-group showed a significantly stronger attentional bias to body related words compared to the HC group (p = .009). LIMITATIONS: Recruitment in in-patient setting might have led to a non-representative sample of PTSD patients. The PTSD patients were not characterized regarding anything other than the mentioned mental disorders. Potentially, the body related words may have been associated with offenders' body areas, but not with the patients. CONCLUSION: We found that patients with PTSD and comorbid BPD had a stronger attentional bias towards body related stimuli in comparison to other groups. This suggests that the observed attentional bias is a product of CSA combined with the emotion regulation difficulties characteristic of BPD. Future studies should test whether directly targeting body-related abnormalities in information processing can improve existing treatments for patients with CSA and BPD.",2015,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,46,,72-7,25244677.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2014.07.010,,#184,Witthoft 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The approach-avoidance task as an online intervention in cigarette smoking: a pilot study,"Wittekind, C. E.; Feist, A.; Schneider, B. C.; Moritz, S.; Fritzsche, A.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dual-process models posit that addictive behaviors are characterized by strong automatic processes that can be assessed with implicit measures. The present study investigated the potential of a cognitive bias modification paradigm, the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT), for retraining automatic behavioral tendencies in cigarette smoking. METHODS: The study was set up as an online intervention. After completing an online survey, 257 smokers were randomly allocated either to one of two experimental conditions (AAT) or a waitlist control group. Participants responded to different pictures by pushing or pulling the computer mouse, depending on the format of the picture. Pictures in portrait format depicted smoking-related items and were associated with pushing, pictures in landscape format depicted neutral items and were associated with pulling. One version of the AAT provided individual feedback after each trial whereas the standard version did not. After four weeks, participants were re-assessed in an online survey. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that the standard AAT, in particular, led to a significant reduction in cigarette consumption, cigarette dependence, and compulsive drive; no effect was found in the control group. LIMITATIONS: Interpretability of the study is constrained by the fact that no active control condition was applied. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the limitations, our findings indicate that the AAT might be a feasible instrument to reduce tobacco dependence and can be applied as an online intervention.

METHODS: From April to June 2020, 155 psychotherapists completed an online questionnaire. Additionally, to job related changes, stress level, symptoms of burnout and well-being were assessed. Furthermore, the influence of active and passive coping strategies as well as of different areas of self-care (e. g., professional support, cognitive awareness for work-related stress and work-life balance) on psychological burden was examined. RESULTS: Psychotherapists worked an average of 1,22 hours less per week during the pandemic than before. On average, 38% of treatments were delivered via video therapy. Avoidant coping strategies were associated with increased stress levels, which predicted higher burnout scores and lower well-being. In contrast, a good work-life balance, a good daily balance at work and active coping had a positive effect. Contrary to expectation, cognitive awareness for work-related stress was related to lower well-being. DISCUSSION: Work-life balance can serve as a preventive strategy to reduce stress during the Corona pandemic and thereby reduce the risk for burnout and improve well-being. Avoidant coping strategies, on the other hand, are a risk factor for increased stress levels during pandemic and promote burnout and lower well-being. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to our knowledge regarding preventive measures to prevent stress and to maintain the well-being of psychotherapist in order to contribute to ongoing high quality patient care during the pandemic.",2022,Apr,Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol,72,3-04,131-138,34781381.0,10.1055/a-1645-1824,,#186,Schwartzkopff 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Introducing an EXperimental Paradigm to investigate Expectation Change (EXPEC),"Kube, T.; Rief, W.; Gollwitzer, M.; Glombiewski, J. A.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dysfunctional expectations are considered to be core features of various mental disorders. Clinical observations suggest that people suffering from mental disorders such as major depression tend to maintain dysfunctional expectations despite expectation-disconfirming evidence. Surprisingly, this clinically relevant phenomenon has not yet sufficiently been investigated in empirical studies. Therefore, we developed an experimental paradigm to investigate expectation change vs. maintenance, and the first step to test its validity is to apply it in healthy individuals. METHODS: After conducting two pilot studies (n = 28; n = 37), the present study systematically examined whether it is possible to change healthy individuals' (n = 102) task-specific and generalized performance expectations through expectation-disconfirming experiences. Using a standardized instruction, we initially induced non-positive expectations regarding participants' ability to successfully work on an unknown test. Then, participants received standardized performance feedback that either confirmed or disconfirmed their expectations before assessing participants' expectations again after completing the Test for the Measure of Emotional Intelligence. RESULTS: Results indicate that expectation-disconfirming feedback led to a significant change of both task-specific and generalized performance expectations. There was no expectation change in the expectation-confirming condition. LIMITATIONS: As the present study examined expectation change among healthy individuals, the next step is to apply this paradigm in a clinical sample and to examine whether expectation change is less likely among people suffering from depression or other mental disorders characterized by dysfunctional expectations. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing more rigorously on expectation maintenance among people with mental disorders could enable therapists to develop expectation-focused interventions aiming at enhancing expectation change.",2018,Jun,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,59,,92-99,29253640.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2017.12.002,,#187,Kube 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Preventive efforts in the aftermath of analogue trauma: The effects of Tetris and exercise on intrusive images,"Bruhl, A.; Heinrichs, N.; Bernstein, E. E.; McNally, R. J.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Efficacious interventions soon after trauma exposure to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are scarce. Evidence suggests that post-trauma, reminder cues to reactivate trauma memory followed by a cognitive visuospatial task, such as Tetris, reduce later intrusive images. Furthermore, studies indicate that aerobic exercise may reduce PTSD symptoms. The present study aimed to test whether playing Tetris, without prior reminder cues, after an experimental trauma limits the development of analogue symptoms and to compare Tetris to aerobic exercise, which could plausibly alter cognitive-affective processing of the trauma as well. METHODS: Participants (N = 71) watched a distressing film and were randomly assigned to either playing Tetris, cycling, or remaining sedentary for 25 min without prior reminder cues. Intrusive images and co-occurring distress were recorded in a diary during the following week. After one week, participants completed a recognition test to assess voluntary memories of the film. RESULTS: Neither Tetris nor exercise, without prior memory reactivation, reduced intrusive images and associated distress nor impeded voluntary memory compared to the control condition. There were no effects of physical fitness level at baseline or voluntary exercise during the subsequent week on analogue symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Although participants were instructed to record intrusions as they occurred in diaries, they did not receive additional reminders throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neither a single bout of aerobic exercise, nor playing Tetris without prior memory reactivation, after an analogue trauma reduces stress symptoms. Potential explanations and clinical implications are discussed.",2019,Sep,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,64,,31-35,30743217.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2019.01.004,,#188,Bruhl 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Remembering rejection: specificity and linguistic styles of autobiographical memories in borderline personality disorder and depression,"Rosenbach, C.; Renneberg, B.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: High levels of rejection sensitivity are assumed to be the result of early and prolonged experiences of rejection. Aim of this study was to investigate autobiographical memories of rejection in clinical samples high in rejection sensitivity (Borderline Personality Disorder, BPD, and Major Depressive Disorder, MDD) and to identify group differences in the quality of the memories. METHODS: Memories of rejection were retrieved using an adapted version of the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT; five positive cue words, five cue words referring to rejection). Specificity of memories and linguistic word usage was analyzed in 30 patients with BPD, 27 patients with MDD and 30 healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients with BPD retrieved less specific memories compared to the healthy control group, whereas patients with MDD did not differ from controls in this regard. The group difference was no longer significant when controlling for rejection sensitivity. Linguistic analysis indicated that compared to both other groups, patients with BPD showed a higher self-focus, used more anger-related words, referred more frequently to social environments, and rated memories of rejection as more relevant for today's life. LIMITATIONS: Clinical symptoms were not assessed in the control group. Moreover, the written form of the AMT might reduce the total number of specific memories. CONCLUSION: The level of rejection sensitivity influenced the specificity of the retrieved memories. Analysis of linguistic styles revealed specific linguistic patterns in BPD compared to non-clinical as well as depressed participants.",2015,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,46,,85-92,25259768.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2014.09.002,,#189,Rosenbach 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"The effects of retrieval versus rehearsal of online problem-solving therapy sessions on recall, problem-solving skills and distress in distressed individuals: An experimental study","Bruijniks, S. J. E.; Sijbrandij, M.; Huibers, M. J. H.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Improving memory for the content of therapy sessions might increase the effects of psychological interventions. Previous studies showed that healthy individuals who took a memory test (retrieval) of studied material showed better long-term memory retention than individuals who restudied (rehearsal) the material. The aim of the current study was to find out whether we can translate these findings to a subclinical setting. METHODS: Individuals with moderate levels of distress were randomized into retrieving (n = 46) or rehearsing (n = 49) four weekly sessions of online Problem-Solving Therapy (PST). Session recall, problem-solving skills and distress were measured at baseline, three days after each session and at one-week follow-up. RESULTS: Retrieval led to overall higher recall, but this difference disappeared when controlling for the time spent on retrieval versus rehearsal. Retrieval did not lead to better problem-solving skills or less distress, compared to rehearsal. Baseline working memory performance moderated the effect of condition on recall after controlling for the time spent on retrieval versus rehearsal: the effect of retrieval compared to rehearsal on recall was larger for individuals with lower working memory performance. LIMITATIONS: The sample mostly consisted of university students with overall high working memory scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided the first evidence that retrieval of the content of PST sessions may lead to better session recall compared to rehearsal of the PST sessions in individuals with a low working memory score.

Effects of induced appearance-related interpretation bias: A test of the cognitive-behavioral model of body dysmorphic disorder,"Dietel, F. A.; Mobius, M.; Steinbach, L.; Dusend, C.; Wilhelm, S.; Buhlmann, U.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Interpretation biases are hypothesized to maintain body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). Although their existence and malleability have been investigated in clinical studies, their causal status in the maintenance of BDD remains unclear. This study examined the effects of a single-session appearance-related interpretation bias training (CBM-I) on bias indices and stress reactivity (i.e., distress, appearance dissatisfaction, self-esteem, perceived physical attractiveness), exploring the causality predicted in cognitive-behavioral models. METHODS: We used a modified version of the Word Sentence Association Paradigm (WSAP), assessing explicit (i.e., decision rates) and more implicit interpretation bias components (i.e., reaction times). Mentally healthy students (N = 112) were randomized to training conditions enhancing positive interpretation patterns (PT) vs. negative interpretation patterns (NT) vs. a no-feedback control condition (CC). Stress reactivity was assessed during the Cyberball Paradigm. RESULTS: The PT showed a pre-post increase in adaptive bias patterns regarding decision and a differential pre-post decrease in reaction times for the rejection of negative interpretations, compared to the other groups. There were no condition-congruent post-training differences in stress reactivity. However, residual interpretation bias change was significantly correlated with state distress, self-esteem and appearance dissatisfaction during stressor exposure. LIMITATIONS: Limitations pertaining to sample characteristics, training and assessment overlap, and stressor task design are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that appearance-related interpretation bias is modifiable both explicitly and more implicitly via CBM-I in a mentally healthy sample.

Enhanced association between perceptual stimuli and trauma-related information in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms,"Lin, M.; Hofmann, S. G.; Qian, M.; Li, S.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intrusive memories in traumatized individuals are often triggered by stimuli that are perceptually (rather than conceptually) similar to those present just before or during the trauma. The present study examined whether those individuals with high levels of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms show a memory bias recall to perceptual cues and trauma target words compared to those with low levels of PTSD. METHODS: The sample consisted of 30 adult participants who were involved in motor-vehicle or work-related accidents; 15 of the participants endorsed clinically elevated symptoms of PTSD, while a comparison group of 15 participants reported low levels of symptoms. Participants performed an associative recognition task with conceptual or perceptual cue words and trauma-related or neutral target words. Participants were tested for their recognition accuracy by reporting the corresponding target when a cue was given. RESULTS: Both groups performed better for the perceptual word pairs than for the conceptual word pairs, irrespective of the target word type. However, only the high PTSD symptoms group exhibited an additional enhancement in performance for the perceptual word pairs with trauma-related target words. LIMITATIONS: A nonclinical sample was utilized for this study; although PTSD was assessed, diagnoses were not confirmed. In addition, there was lack of a healthy non-traumatized control group. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide partial support for the cognitive model and the notion that intrusive memories are specific to the trauma-related event rather than to a general associative learning bias.",2015,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,46,,202-7,25460268.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2014.10.008,,#192,Lin 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Vividness of general mental imagery is associated with the occurrence of intrusive memories,"Morina, N.; Leibold, E.; Ehring, T.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intrusive memories of traumatic events constitute a core feature of post-traumatic stress disorder. However, the association of pre-traumatic factors with post-traumatic intrusive memories is still only poorly understood. The current study investigated the extent to which vividness of general mental imagery prior to an analogue stressor is positively associated with occurrence of intrusive images following such a stressor. METHODS: Sixty-seven participants were exposed to video material depicting the aftermath of serious road traffic accidents. Additionally, participants filled in questionnaires on mental imagery, affect, peri-traumatic processing style, and intrusive memories. RESULTS: Vividness of mental imagery before the analogue stressor correlated positively with the amount, vividness, and emotional distress due to intrusive images shortly after the analogue stressor and on the subsequently five days. Importantly, mental imagery assessed pre-stressor was associated with intrusive memories independently of trait anxiety and depression as well as participants' emotional response to the video. Peri-traumatic data-driven processing was also related to intrusive memories but not to the vividness of pre-stressor mental imagery. LIMITATIONS: An analogue design was used. Results need to be replicated in a prospective design with survivors of traumatic events according to DSM-IV criteria.

"If the discrepancy between expectations and actual information is too large, expectation change decreases - A replication study","Kube, T.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mental disorders have been related to aberrations in using novel positive information to revise established negative beliefs. Previous research used to make a binary distinction between belief-confirming vs. -disconfirming information, but recently it has been examined how varying levels of positive information is used to update beliefs. The present study aimed to replicate a recent finding suggesting that positive information that deviates to a large extent from people's prior expectations raises doubts about the credibility of new information and therefore hardly leads to change in expectations. METHODS: In a heterogenous sample (N = 144), participants were provided with slightly positive, moderately positive, or extremely positive information in relation to their prior expectations about other people's behaviour. RESULTS: Replicating previous research, the present study found that expectation change was greatest for moderately positive information. It also provided evidence for a possible mechanism underlying the inverse U-shaped relationship between the positivity of new information and change in expectations: Extremely positive information was devalued through defensive cognitive strategies, referred to as cognitive immunisation. LIMITATIONS: Unlike previous research, the belief update task used in this study did not show any association with depressive symptoms, so it is questionable how suitable it is to study biased belief updating in depression. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike traditional learning models, the present results suggest a tipping point above which the discrepancy between expectation and outcome is suspiciously large, so that the degree of expectation change decreases.",2023,Jun,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,79,,101831,36521199.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2022.101831,,#194,Kube 2023,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Disrupted joint action accounts for reduced likability of socially anxious individuals,"Gunak, M. M.; Clark, D. M.; Lommen, M. J. J.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Motivated by their fear of disapproval, individuals with social anxiety continually monitor their own behaviour during social interactions hoping to prevent dreaded negative outcomes. Ironically, they do evoke less positive reactions from others. This study investigated whether lower engagement in the interpersonal process of joint action by socially anxious individuals leads them to attract less positive ratings by their conversation partners. METHOD: High socially anxious (HSA; N = 36) and low socially anxious individuals (LSA; N = 36) had separate conversations with a naive conversation partner (N = 36). Conversations were filmed and analysed for joint action using the conventional manual way and a more exploratory automated way. Conversation partners rated the quality of the interaction and the person they talked to. RESULTS: Conversation partners rated HSA participants less positively than LSA participants. The conventional manual method showed less joint action in conversations with LSA participants and crucially, joint action served as mediator between social anxiety status and general impression, quality of interaction and desire to meet again. These results were not replicated with the automated method. LIMITATIONS: The study used an analogue sample and future research should investigate whether these findings also apply to a clinical sample. Future studies should further explore the utility of automated techniques to measure joint action. CONCLUSION: Reduced joint action may explain why socially anxious individuals tend to be perceived less positively by others. The findings emphasise the importance of taking an interpersonal and holistic approach to understanding aspects of social anxiety disorder.",2020,Sep,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,68,,101512,31739248.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2019.101512,,#195,Gunak 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Haunting self-images? The role of negative self-images in adolescent social anxiety disorder,"Schreiber, F.; Steil, R.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Negative distorted self-images (NSI) allegedly maintain social anxiety in adults suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD). These NSI are activated in feared social situations and are often linked to past socially traumatic events. However, because empirical evidence on the presence and characteristics of such NSI in adolescents suffering from SAD is limited, the aim of the present study is to examine the nature of NSI in adolescent SAD patients. METHODS: Using a semi-structured interview, 31 adolescents with a primary diagnosis of SAD and 31 healthy adolescents (HA) who were matched for age and gender, completed a questionnaire set assessing the characteristics of NSI, social anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Relative to the HA-group, those suffering from SAD reported experiencing NSI significantly more frequently, more vividly, and with greater distress. No significant differences between the groups emerged regarding a link between the NSI and an autobiographical event. However, NSI were reported as more often having an observer-perspective in the SAD as compared to the HA-group. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that certain characteristics of the NSI predict social anxiety beyond the influence of depression in adolescents with SAD. DISCUSSION: NSI seem to be an important feature of adolescent SAD and phenomenological comparable to NSI in adults suffering from SAD. CONCLUSIONS: Specific interventions aiming to correct NSI, which have proven to be highly effective in adults, should be developmentally-adapted and evaluated in future studies.",2013,Jun,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,44,2,158-64,23207962.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2012.10.003,,#196,Schreiber 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The perils of aiming too high: Discrepancy between goals and performance in individuals with depressive symptoms,"Arens, E. A.; Zeier, P.; Schwieren, C.; Huisgen, H.; Barnow, S.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Negative evaluation processes play a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms. However, it remains to be understood, whether evaluation processes in depression are impaired by maladaptive goal setting. METHOD: In a non-clinical sample (N = 50) of individuals with high (BDI-II-Score: 13-29) and low (BDI-II-Score: 0-3) levels of depressive symptoms goal setting prior to working on a cognitive task was measured. Goal feasibility was experimentally manipulated using an easy and a difficult version of the task. RESULTS: When goal feasibility was low, a high level of depressive symptoms was associated with setting unattainable goals. Whereas individuals with low level of depressive symptoms adjusted their goals to a lower (more realistic) level when task difficulty increased, individuals with high level of depressive symptoms initially adhered to significantly higher goals, so that their performance failed to meet their self-set standards. After depressed individual revised their goals downwards, their subsequent performance on the task also worsened. LIMITATIONS: The use of a non-clinical sample with self-reported depressive symptoms limits the generalizability of our findings to a clinical population. Future research would benefit from the use of a larger sample with patients suffering from clinical depression. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the notion that negative evaluation processes in depressed individuals might be linked with their tendency to generate intractable conflicts between self-set inappropriate high goals and their own capacities to perform. However, the findings need to be confirmed in clinical samples to draw conclusions about the role of goal setting in negative evaluation processes in depression.",2018,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,58,,12-17,28759778.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2017.07.002,,#197,Arens 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Nocebo hyperalgesia induced by implicit conditioning,"Brascher, A. K.; Witthoft, M.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nocebo hyperalgesia (i.e., increased pain sensitivity based on expectations) can be induced by conditioning, but is supposed to be mediated by conscious expectation. Although recent evidence points to the feasibility of subliminal conditioning of nocebo hyperalgesia with masked faces, face processing might be a special case and the practical implications of subliminal conditioning remain questionable. This study aimed to implicitly condition nocebo hyperalgesia using supraliminal cues. METHODS: Implicit differential nocebo conditioning (N = 48 healthy participants) was implemented by coupling high and low painful electric stimuli to varying visual stimuli that only differed in the symmetry/asymmetry of one component (CS+/CS-) and contained further distracting components. In the test phase, only the low painful stimulus followed both CS to test for conditioned nocebo effects in intensity and aversiveness ratings and electrodermal activity. A behavioral contingency test and a post-experimental questionnaire assessed contingency awareness. RESULTS: A conditioned effect emerged in the aversiveness (p = .036; eta(2) = 0.09), but not in the intensity rating (p = .195) while controlling for contingency awareness. Further, increased skin conductance levels in response to CS + emerged, irrespective of contingency awareness (p = .014, eta(2) = 0.13). No conditioned responses in skin conductance responses emerged (p = .872). LIMITATIONS: Expected effects only emerged in part of the outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the notion that implicit conditioning of nocebo hypoalgesia is feasible using a novel experimental conditioning design with supraliminal stimulus presentation, although further research is needed. So far, implicitly conditioned nocebo effects might have been underestimated despite vast clinical implications.",2019,Sep,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,64,,106-112,30952053.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2019.03.006,,#198,Brascher 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The relationship between drinking motives and alcohol-related interpretation biases,"Woud, M. L.; Becker, E. S.; Rinck, M.; Salemink, E.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies have investigated drinking motives and alcohol-related interpretation biases (IBs) separately. However, less is known about the relationship between them. Therefore, the present study examined whether coping and enhancement drinking motives were specifically related to negative and positive alcohol-related IBs, respectively. Furthermore, it was investigated whether such biases predict future drinking, especially in individuals with low levels of executive control (EC). METHODS: Participants were male and female university students. The Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised (DMQ-R; Cooper, 1994) was administered to measure participants' drinking motives. To measure alcohol-related IBs, an adapted version of the Encoding Recognition Task (ERT) was used. During the ERT, participants were asked to read ambiguous alcohol-related scenarios. In a subsequent recognition phase, participants interpreted these scenarios. A classical Stroop was applied to assess levels of EC. RESULTS: Coping motives but not enhancement motives were a unique predictor of the tendency to interpret negatively valenced ambiguous alcohol-relevant situations in an alcohol-related manner. This relationship was significant even when controlling for other relevant predictors. Neither coping nor enhancement motives were predictive of positive alcohol-related IBs. Concerning the prediction of prospective drinking, results showed that particularly the negative alcohol-related IB predicted prospective drinking. However, EC did not moderate the prediction of prospective drinking by either positive or negative interpretation biases. LIMITATIONS: The alcohol-ERT might not be the most optimal paradigm for assessing implicit alcohol-related IBs. CONCLUSIONS: The present results emphasize the role of negative affect in the context of drinking motives and alcohol-related IBs. Follow-up studies are needed to test the robustness of these findings, and to further explore the general interplay between drinking motives and alcohol-related IBs.",2015,Jun,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,47,,102-10,25525773.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2014.11.012,,#199,Woud 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Assessment of automatic associations with bodily sensations and agoraphobic situations in panic disorder,"Woud, M. L.; Becker, E. S.; Rinck, M.; Harmer, C. J.; Reinecke, A.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: One of the central assumptions of cognitive models of Panic Disorder (PD) is that automatic panic-related associations are a core feature of PD. However, empirical findings are mixed and inconsistent, rendering it difficult to evaluate the role of panic-related associations adequately, particularly in relation to the relevant theories. The present study aimed to further advance our understanding of automatic associations in PD, and therefore applied a paradigm novel in this context, namely an Extrinsic Affective Simon Task (EAST). METHODS: Participants involved treatment seeking, unmedicated panic patients (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 38). The EAST was applied prior to treatment. It included the following stimuli as targets: panic-related bodily sensations and agoraphobia-related situations, and as attributes: pleasant versus unpleasant, fear-related words. RESULTS: Contrary to our expectations, panic patients did not show stronger negative than positive automatic associations for either panic-related symptoms or agoraphobia-related situations, compared to healthy controls. Moreover, EAST effects did not correlate with panic-related self-report measures. LIMITATIONS: Although the present study involved patients who were actively seeking treatment, panic-related associations might not have been activated sufficiently. Hence, a brief activation procedure (e.g., hyperventilation) might have been needed to optimize the assessment condition.

Risky decision-making under risk in schizophrenia: A deliberate choice?,"Pedersen, A.; Goder, R.; Tomczyk, S.; Ohrmann, P.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with schizophrenia reveal impaired decision-making strategies causing social, financial and health care problems. The extent to which deficits in decision-making reflect intentional risky choices in schizophrenia is still under debate. Based on previous studies we expected patients with schizophrenia to reveal a riskier performance on the GDT and to make more disadvantageous decisions on the IGT. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated 38 patients with schizophrenia and 38 matched healthy control subjects with two competing paradigms regarding feedback: (1) The Game of Dice Task (GDT), in which the probabilities of winning or losing are stable and explicitly disclosed to the subject, to assess decision-making under risk and (2) the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which requires subjects to infer the probabilities of winning or losing from feedback, to investigate decision-making under ambiguity. RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia revealed an overall riskier performance on the GDT; although they adjusted their strategy over the course of the GDT, they still made significantly more disadvantageous choices than controls. More positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia indicated by higher PANSS positive scores were associated with riskier choices and less use of negative feedback. Compared to healthy controls, they were not impaired in net score but chose more disadvantageous cards than controls on the first block of the IGT. LIMITATIONS: Effects of medication at the time of testing cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with schizophrenia make riskier decisions and are less able to regulate their decision-making to implement advantageous strategies, even when the probabilities of winning or losing are explicitly disclosed.

Age effect on autobiographical memory specificity: A study on autobiographical memory specificity in elderly survivors of childhood trauma,"Wittekind, C. E.; Jelinek, L.; Kleim, B.; Muhtz, C.; Moritz, S.; Berna, F.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is accompanied by altered autobiographical memories (AM) of the traumatic incident itself as well as of non-trauma-related events. Several studies have shown that trauma-exposed individuals developing PTSD have a reduced capacity to access specific past events that are not related to the traumatic event compared to those who do not develop PTSD. However, one study including a group of elderly adults did not find significant differences in AM between PTSD and non-PTSD participants. The present study investigated whether PTSD is associated with impaired AM of trauma-related and non-trauma-related memories in the elderly. METHOD: Forty-four elderly participants, displaced during childhood from former German territories after the end of World War II (WWII), were examined. This group comprised 19 participants with and 25 participants without PTSD. These participants were compared to 23 non-traumatized non-displaced elderly participants. RESULTS: PTSD, non-PTSD and non-traumatized participants do not differ significantly in their ability to recall specific memories of their past. Moreover, participants with PTSD did not recall more trauma-related memories than non-PTSD participants. LIMITATIONS: The traumatized participants reached for assessment might represent the most resilient individuals, which might constrain generalizability of our results to other trauma populations. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms preliminary evidence that PTSD is not associated with AM impairment in the elderly. We suggest that aging may alter the relationship between trauma and AM impairment in traumatized participants with PTSD, which need to be confirmed by longitudinal studies.",2017,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,54,,247-253,27685852.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2016.09.002,,#202,Wittekind 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Linking Depression with Negative Alcohol-Related Consequences: A Structural Equation Model Among a Clinically Depressed Population,"Gawron, L.; Gerlach, A. L.","Background and Objectives: Previous research suggests that rumination acts as a mediating mechanism in the association between depression and drinking motives, particularly drinking to cope, as well as negative alcohol-related consequences. In this study, we tested the connections between depressive symptoms, rumination, drinking motives, alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related problems in a clinically depressed population (N = 209). Methods: Structural equation modeling was used to test the models. Specifications were based on the results of a previously evaluated model in a sample of college students. Results: The complex model showed a significant positive association between depressive symptoms and rumination. Drinking motives (enhancement and coping) were linked to more negative alcohol-related consequences. In a simplified model, pronounced depressive symptoms were associated with both increased ruminative thinking and more negative alcohol-related problems. Rumination was connected with stronger drinking motives (combined in one general factor), which were again associated with alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems. Limitations: The use of self-report measures to determine diagnostic validity.

Grab it or not? Measuring avoidance of spiders with touchscreen-based hand movements,"Rinck, M.; Dapprich, A.; Lender, A.; Kahveci, S.; Blechert, J.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have shown that humans, particularly those with high levels of spider fear, show automatic avoidance of spiders. However, most tasks used in these studies employ symbolic approach-avoidance movements instead of naturalistic movements. METHODS: The current study employed a touchscreen-based approach-avoidance task in which 86 female participants made hand and arm movements that mimic the real-life touching, grasping, and moving of spiders. Using a large touchscreen, they had to reach for pictures of spiders and neutral objects (leaves), touch them, and drag them either away from themselves or towards themselves. To draw attention to stimulus content, pictures of butterflies were used in additional NoGo trials, they required participants to not move their hand. RESULTS: Avoidance of spiders was observed in both the pre-movement times (time to lift the hand from a starting position) and the grabbing times (time to reach the picture), and this avoidance was larger for more spider-fearful participants. The dragging times (time to swipe the picture), however, revealed a relative spider-approach tendency: Compared to leaves, participants were faster to drag spiders closer than to swipe them away. LIMITATIONS: We discuss potential reasons for this mixed pattern of results, including the low reliability of the dragging times. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of touchscreens for the assessment of approach-avoidance tendencies, and we suggest avenues for further research.",2021,Dec,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,73,,101670,34157656.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2021.101670,,#204,Rinck 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Changes in negative implicit evaluations in patients of hypochondriasis after treatment with cognitive therapy or exposure therapy,"Schreiber, F.; Witthoft, M.; Neng, J. M.; Weck, F.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies using modified versions of the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005) have revealed that there is an implicit negative evaluation bias of illness-related information in patients with hypochondriasis (HYP), which might be a maintaining feature of HYP. However, there is no evidence on whether this bias might be targeted successfully by effective treatments, such as exposure therapy (ET) or cognitive therapy (CT). This is the first study to examine the change in negative implicit evaluations in a randomized controlled trial, including individual CT and ET, compared to a wait-list control group for HYP. METHODS: An AMP with illness, symptom and neutral primes was used in 70 patients with HYP before and after treatment (wait-list respectively). RESULTS: There was no significant change in negative implicit affective evaluations in both CT and ET, compared to wait-list. However, comparisons between the two active treatments revealed an interaction effect, that only for CT were the affective reactions on illness-as well as symptom-related prime trials (but not neutral primes) significantly more positive at post-compared to pre-treatment. In CT but not in ET, the reduction of implicit negative evaluation bias regarding symptom-related primes was significantly related to the reduction of self-reported health anxiety. LIMITATIONS: The small subsample sizes for CT and ET, in comparison to wait-list, prohibit the detection of smaller effects. CONCLUSIONS: Formal cognitive restructuring is necessary for reducing implicit negative evaluation bias in HYP, but the latter is not a prerequisite for reducing health anxiety. Thus, the importance of the negative implicit evaluation bias for the maintenance of HYP remains questionable.",2016,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,50,,139-46,26204567.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2015.07.005,,#205,Schreiber 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Social interactions in virtual reality exposure therapy: A proof-of-concept pilot study,"Morina, N.; Brinkman, W. P.; Hartanto, D.; Kampmann, I. L.; Emmelkamp, P. M.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Research on virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has demonstrated good treatment efficacy with regards to several anxiety disorders. Yet, there is lack of knowledge about the value of integrating interaction between clients and virtual humans in VRET. Such interaction might prove effective in treating psychological complaints that involve social interactions, such as social anxiety. METHODS: A VRET system specifically designed to expose clients with social anxiety disorder to anxiety provoking social situations was applied to 16 and 18 individuals with high and low levels of social anxiety, respectively. Participants engaged in two exposure sessions in several free speech dialogues with virtual humans while being monitored by a therapist. RESULTS: Participants with high levels of social anxiety reported significantly lower levels of social anxiety three months after exposure to two virtual reality interaction sessions than before treatment (p < 0.01). In the group with low levels of social anxiety, no significant change of social anxiety was reported between pre-treatment and follow-up. Additionally, participants in both groups reported higher self-efficacy three months after treatment than before treatment (ps </= 0.001).

A virtual reality-integrated program for improving social skills in patients with schizophrenia: a pilot study,"Rus-Calafell, M.; Gutierrez-Maldonado, J.; Ribas-Sabate, J.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Social skills training (SST) intervention has shown its efficacy to improve social dysfunction in patients with psychosis; however the implementation of new skills into patients' everyday functioning is difficult to achieve. In this study, we report results from the application of a virtual reality (VR) integrated program as an adjunct technique to a brief social skills intervention for patients with schizophrenia. It was predicted that the intervention would improve social cognition and performance of patients as well as generalisation of the learned responses into patient's daily life. METHODS: Twelve patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed the study. They attended sixteen individual one-hour sessions, and outcome assessments were conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment and four-month follow-up. RESULTS: The results of a series of repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant improvement in negative symptoms, psychopathology, social anxiety and discomfort, avoidance and social functioning. Objective scores obtained through the use of the VR program showed a pattern of learning in emotion perception, assertive behaviours and time spent in a conversation. Most of these gains were maintained at four-month follow-up. LIMITATIONS: The reported results are based on a small, uncontrolled pilot study. Although there was an independent rater for the self-reported and informant questionnaires, assessments were not blinded. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the intervention may be effective for improving social dysfunction.

Schema therapy for chronic depression: Results of a multiple single case series,"Renner, F.; Arntz, A.; Peeters, F. P.; Lobbestael, J.; Huibers, M. J.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test the effects of individual schema therapy (ST) for patients with chronic depression. METHODS: Using a multiple-baseline single case series design, patients with chronic major depressive disorder (N = 25) first entered a 6-24 weeks baseline phase; this phase functioned as a no-treatment control condition. Then, patients started a 12 week exploration phase during which symptoms and underlying schemas were explored; this phase functioned as an attention control condition. Next, patients received up to 65 sessions of individual ST. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) were the primary outcome measures. The BDI-II was assessed once a week during all phases of the study resulting in 100 repeated assessments per participant on average. Mixed regression analysis was used to contrast change in symptoms during the intervention with change in symptoms during the baseline and exploration control phases. RESULTS: When compared to the no-treatment control period, the intervention had a significant, large effect on depressive symptoms (Cohen's d BDI-II = 1.30; Cohen's d QIDS = 1.22). Effects on secondary continuous outcomes were moderate to large. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size and lack of a control group.

Interpreting and responding to ambiguous natural images in spider phobia,"Haberkamp, A.; Schmidt, F.; Biafora, M.; Schmidt, T.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The fast detection of and response to threatening stimuli is an important task of the human visual and motor systems, and is especially challenging when stimuli are ambiguous. This study investigates the perception, evaluation and fast response to ambiguous natural spider stimuli in spider-fearful and non-anxious participants. METHODS: Stimuli were created by gradually morphing natural images of spiders and non-spiders (a crab, a starfish, a bunch of keys, and a flower). In Study 1, participants rated the images on perceptual and emotional dimensions and responded to them in a response priming task to measure rapid information processing. In Study 2, results were validated and extended in a different paradigm by using a go/no-go task. RESULTS: As expected, spider-fearful participants showed an interpretative bias for ambiguous stimuli (i.e., perceived them as more similar to spiders) and rated spider(-like) stimuli as more unpleasant, arousing, and disgusting. In Study 1, spider stimuli were preferentially processed in spider-fearful participants as observed in faster responses to spider targets-however, responses were not different to comparison participants for ambiguous stimuli. Study 2 suggests that this finding can be explained by differences in stimulus duration. LIMITATIONS: No participants with positive attitudes towards spiders or a second fearful comparison group were included. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that these findings can be explained by the nature of the applied tasks that tap into early phases of visual processing, thereby relying on feedforward-mediated low-spatial-frequency information extracted via the fast, subcortical path to the amygdala.",2019,Dec,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,65,,101495,31398572.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2019.101495,,#210,Haberkamp 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Cognitive-affective reactions to a non-judgmental and judgmental mirror gazing task in individuals with body dysmorphic concerns,"Schoenenberg, K.; Martin, A.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The look into the mirror represents a typical trigger situation for people with body dysmorphic concerns. Mirror exposure on the other hand is commonly used in the treatment of Body Dysmorphic Disorder even though little is known about its precise effects. This study aimed to investigate cognitive-affective processes related to mirror gazing. METHODS: A total of 125 individuals (screening for body dysmorphic concerns: N(BDD+) = 56, negative N(BDD-) = 69) participated in a laboratory study using a guided 10-min mirror gazing task. Participants were randomized to one of two experimental conditions, a non-judgmental and judgmental description of the own body during mirror gazing. Distress, self-hostile cognitions and post-event processing were assessed after the task and at follow-up. RESULTS: Participants with body dysmorphic concerns showed higher values regarding subjective appearance distortion, stress induced by the exposure, distress, self-hostile cognitions and post-event processing compared to the symptom negative group. The two conditions did not yield differential effects. LIMITATIONS: The short duration of the mirror gazing and the only internal description of the body may have contributed to a missing effect for the approach. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the importance of cognitive and affective processes in reaction to mirror exposure. They support the cognitive model of BDD and suggest post-event processing as a relevant factor requiring further investigation in future research.",2022,Dec,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,77,,101779,36113914.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2022.101779,,#211,Schoenenberg 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Social consequences of subclinical negative symptoms: An EMG study of facial expressions within a social interaction,"Riehle, M.; Lincoln, T. M.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are related to lower social functioning even in non-clinical samples, but little is known about the distinct social consequences of motivational and expressive negative symptoms. In this study we focused on expressive negative symptoms and examined how these symptoms and varying degrees of pro-social facial expressiveness (smiling and mimicry of smiling) relate to the social evaluations by face-to-face interaction partners and to social support. METHODS: We examined 30 dyadic interactions within a sample of non-clinical participants (N = 60) who were rated on motivational and expressive negative symptoms with the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS). We collected data on both interaction partners' smiling-muscle (zygomaticus major) activation simultaneously with electromyography and assessed the general amount of smiling and the synchrony of smiling muscle activations between interaction partners (mimicry of smiling). Interaction partners rated their willingness for future interactions with each other after the interactions. RESULTS: Interaction partners of participants scoring higher on expressive negative symptoms expressed less willingness for future interactions with these participants (r = -0.37; p = 0.01). Smiling behavior was negatively related to expressive negative symptoms but also explained by motivational negative symptoms. Mimicry of smiling and both negative symptom domains were also associated with participants' satisfaction with their social support network.

Social and monetary incentives counteract fear-driven avoidance: Evidence from approach-avoidance decisions,"Pittig, A.; Hengen, K.; Bublatzky, F.; Alpers, G. W.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The reduction of avoidance behavior is a central target in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but it has rarely been studied how approach of fear-relevant stimuli may be initiated. In two studies, the impact of hypothetical monetary and symbolic social incentives on approach-avoidance behavior was examined. METHODS: In Study 1, individuals high or low on fear of spiders (N = 84) could choose to approach a fear-relevant versus a neutral stimulus, which were equally rewarded. In a subsequent micro-intervention, approaching the fear-relevant stimulus was differentially rewarded either by monetary or social incentives. In Study 2 (N = 76), initial incentives for approach were discontinued to investigate the stability of approach. RESULTS: Hypothetical monetary and symbolic social incentives reduced or eliminated initial avoidance, even in highly fearful individuals. Approach resulted in a decrease of self-reported aversiveness towards the fear-relevant stimulus. However, even after successful approach, fearful individuals showed significant avoidance behavior when incentives for approach were discontinued. LIMITATIONS: Future research should investigate the long-term effects of prolonged approach incentives on multiple levels of fear (e.g., self-report, behavioral, physiological). It should also be tested if such an intervention actually improves compliance with exposure based interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings highlight that incentives are useful to initiate initial approach towards a feared stimulus. Although incentive-based approach may neither fully eliminate avoidance nor negative feelings towards the feared stimulus, such operant interventions may set the stage for more extensive extinction training.",2018,Sep,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,60,,69-77,29747141.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.04.002,,#213,Pittig 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Exploring mechanisms of change in schema therapy for chronic depression,"Renner, F.; DeRubeis, R.; Arntz, A.; Peeters, F.; Lobbestael, J.; Huibers, M. J.

The aim of this study was to explore the impact of two potentially important mechanisms of symptom change, maladaptive schemas (proxied by negative idiosyncratic core-beliefs) and the therapeutic alliance. METHODS: We drew data from a single-case series of ST for cMDD. Patients with cMDD (N = 20) received on average 78 repeated weekly assessments over a course of up to 65 individual sessions of ST. Focusing on repeated assessments within-individuals, we used mixed regression to test whether change in core-beliefs and therapeutic alliance preceded, followed, or occurred concurrently with change in depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Changes in core-beliefs did not precede but were concurrently related to changes in symptoms. Repeated goal and task agreement ratings (specific aspects of alliance) of the same session, completed on separate days, were at least in part associated with concurrent changes in symptoms. LIMITATIONS: By design this study had a small sample-size and no control group.

The manipulation of alcohol-related interpretation biases by means of Cognitive Bias Modification--Interpretation (CBM-I),"Woud, M. L.; Hutschemaekers, M. H.; Rinck, M.; Becker, E. S.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is a large body of evidence demonstrating that alcohol abuse and misuse is characterized by alcohol-related interpretation biases (IBs). The present study tested whether alcohol-related IBs can be trained, and whether this has an effect on alcohol-related associations and drinking behavior. A newly developed alcohol Cognitive Bias Modification - Interpretation (CBM-I) training was employed. The potential moderating effect of executive control on CBM-I training effects was tested. METHOD: Participants were hazardously male drinking students. A classical Stroop was used to assess levels of executive control. Half of the sample was trained to interpret ambiguous alcohol-related scenarios in an alcohol-related manner (alcohol training group), whereas the other half was trained to interpret ambiguous alcohol-related scenarios in a neutral manner (neutral training group). A Single Target Implicit Association Test (STIAT) was used to test whether the training would generalize to implicit alcohol-related associations (target words: alcohol, attributes: positive vs. neutral). To test the training's effect on drinking behavior, a bogus taste test and a one week follow-up measure assessing participant's real life drinking behavior were used. RESULTS: The CBM-I training was partly successful: When presented with novel ambiguous alcohol-related scenarios, participants of the alcohol training group interpreted these scenarios as more alcohol-related after the training. However, there was no reduction in alcohol-related IBs in the neutral training group. Results of the STIAT demonstrated that both training groups showed stronger positive than neutral alcohol-related associations. However, there were no between-group differences in alcohol-related associations. Moreover, the CBM-I training's effect was not moderated by levels of executive control. Finally, no group differences were found on levels of alcohol consumption (bogus taste test and at one week follow-up). LIMITATIONS: The neutral training might have been operationalized sub-optimally. A multi-session training might have resulted in stronger effects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are the first to show that alcohol-related IBs can be trained.

Does rumination mediate the relationship between emotion regulation ability and posttraumatic stress disorder?,"Ehring, T.; Ehlers, A.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Trauma-related rumination has been suggested to be involved in the maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This view has empirically been supported by extensive evidence using cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental designs. However, it is unclear why trauma survivors engage in rumination despite its negative consequences. The current study aimed to explore the hypothesis that low emotion regulation ability underlies trauma-related rumination. METHODS: Emotion regulation ability and trauma-related rumination were assessed in 93 road traffic accident survivors 2 weeks post-trauma. In addition, symptom levels of PTSD were assessed at 2 weeks as well as 1, 3, and 6 months follow-up. RESULTS: Emotion regulation ability was significantly related to trauma-related rumination as well as levels of PTSD symptoms.

"Costly avoidance in anxious individuals: Elevated threat avoidance in anxious individuals under high, but not low competing rewards","Pittig, A.; Scherbaum, S.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: When avoiding threat conflicts with approaching rewards, balanced responses to threat and reward information is required to guide functional behavior. Elevated threat avoidance characterizes anxious psychopathology. However, little is known about the mutual impact of threat and reward information on approach-avoidance behavior and its link to anxiety. METHODS: High trait-anxious and low-anxious individuals (N = 74) repeatedly choose between two options. A threat/high-reward option was linked to two outcomes: a varying chance to receive an aversive stimulus and a varying high reward. A safe/low-reward option was linked to absence of the aversive stimulus and a low reward. RESULTS: Avoidance of the threat/high-reward option increased with increasing threat. Despite threat, low-anxious individuals increasingly approached the threat/high-reward option when rewards increased. High- compared to low-anxious individuals showed elevated avoidance, but only in the presence of high competing rewards. LIMITATIONS: Future research should examine boundary conditions by manipulating type and motivational value of appetitive and aversive outcomes (e.g., food as primary reinforcer).

Concurrent and predictive relations of multidimensional perfectionism with test anxiety in secondary school students,"Stricker, J.; Schneider, M.; Preckel, F.","Background and Objectives. Perfectionism is a multidimensional personality trait often viewed as a risk factor for developing test anxiety. A recent meta-analysis showed positive correlations of perfectionism facets with test anxiety dimensions. However, all previous research into the perfectionism-test anxiety relation has been cross-sectional. Thus, it is unclear whether perfectionism facets longitudinally predict test anxiety.Design. In this study, we investigated concurrent and predictive relations of two perfectionism facets with cognitive test anxiety (worry) and affective test anxiety (emotionality) in secondary school students (N = 478, mean age at T1 = 11.95 years). At T1, participants completed self-report measures of text anxiety and perfectionism. Almost five years later, participants again reported their test anxiety levels (T2).Results. Concern over mistakes and doubts correlated positively with current worry and emotionality. Personal standards correlated positively with current worry. Neither concern over mistakes and doubts nor personal standards significantly predicted later test anxiety beyond baseline.Conclusions. Perfectionism and test anxiety share common manifestations. Yet, this study raises the question whether perfectionism truly influences test anxiety development or whether other factors (e.g., construct overlap) may explain the identified cross-sectional correlations.

How we walk affects what we remember: gait modifications through biofeedback change negative affective memory bias,"Michalak, J.; Rohde, K.; Troje, N.

These studies have focused on increasing intensity and amount of physical activity. In the present study, we investigated whether not only the intensity but also the style of physical activity affects depression related processes. METHOD: Using an unobtrusive biofeedback technique, we manipulated participants (39 undergraduates) to change their walking patterns to either reflect the characteristics of depressed patients or a particularly happy walking style. The intensity of walking (i.e. walking speed) was held constant across condition. During walking, participants first encoded and later recalled a series of emotionally loaded terms. RESULTS: The difference between recalled positive and recalled negative words was much lower in participants who adopted a depressed walking style as compared to participants who walked as if they were happy. LIMITATIONS: The effects of gait manipulation were investigated in a non-clinical group of undergraduates.

No randomized trial has evaluated the effects of smooth pursuit eye movement training (SPT) and visual scanning training (VST) at the bedside on these variables. Objective To compare the effects of SPT and VST in postacute stroke at 1 month with left neglect. METHODS: We carried out an assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The 24 participants were randomly allocated to either SPT or VST (n = 12 each). They received 20 treatment sessions lasting 30 minutes each at the bedside over 4 weeks. Outcome measures included the Functional Neglect Index (FNI) based on 4 tasks: find objects on a tray, stick bisection, picture search, and gaze orientation. In addition, the Unawareness and Behavioral Neglect Index (UBNI) with 6 items about unawareness and 4 about neglect in activities of daily living, the Help index (required assistance in 10 functional activities), the Barthel Index, and the rehabilitation phase were rated by treatment-blinded assessors. Outcome measures were obtained before and immediately after the end of the interventions and at a 2-week follow-up. Results Significantly greater improvements were obtained after SPT versus VST treatment in the FNI and UBNI, and there were continued improvements selectively in the SPT group 2 weeks later.

Biased Perception of Physiological Arousal in Child Social Anxiety Disorder Before and After Cognitive Behavioral Treatment,"Asbrand, J.; Schulz, A.; Heinrichs, N.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.","BACKGROUND: A biased perception of physiological hyperreactivity to social-evaluative situations is crucial for the maintenance of social anxiety disorder (SAD). Alterations in interoceptive accuracy (IAc) when confronted with social stressors may play a role for SAD in children. We expected a biased perception of hyperarousal in children with SAD before treatment and, consequently, a reduced bias after successful cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). METHOD: In two centers, 64 children with the diagnosis of SAD and 55 healthy control (HC) children (both 9 to 13 years) participated in the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C), which was repeated after children with SAD were assigned to either a 12-week group CBT (n = 31) or a waitlist condition (n = 33). Perception of and worry about physiological arousal and autonomic variables (heart rate, skin conductance) were assessed. After each TSST-C, all children further completed a heartbeat perception task to assess IAc. RESULTS: Before treatment, children with SAD reported both a stronger perception of and more worry about their heart rate and skin conductance than HC children, while the objective reactivity of heart rate did not differ. Additionally, children with SAD reported heightened perception of and increased worry about trembling throughout the TSST-C compared to HC children, but reported increased worry about blushing only after the stress phase of the TSST-C compared to HC children. Children with and without SAD did not differ in IAc. Contrary to our hypothesis, after treatment, children in the CBT group reported heightened perception of physiological arousal and increased worry on some parameters after the baseline phase of the TSST-C, whereas actual IAc remained unaffected. IAc before and after treatment were significantly related. CONCLUSIONS: Increased self-reported perception of physiological arousal may play a role in childhood SAD and could be an important target in CBT. However, further studies should examine if this is an epiphenomenon, a temporarily occurring and necessary condition for change, or indeed an unwanted adverse intervention effect.",2020,Jun,Clin Psychol Eur,2,2,e2691,36397826.0,10.32872/cpe.v2i2.2691,,#223,Asbrand 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Diagnostic Accuracy of the Drug Use Disorder Identification Test and Its Short Form, the DUDIT-C, in German Adolescent Psychiatric Patients","Basedow, L. A.; Kuitunen-Paul, S.; Eichler, A.; Roessner, V.; Golub, Y.","BACKGROUND: A common screening instrument for substance use disorders (SUDs) is the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) which includes a short form regarding only drug consumption (DUDIT-C). We aim to assess if a German version of the DUDIT, adapted for adolescents, is a suitable screening instrument in a sample of adolescent psychiatric patients. METHODS: N = 124 (54 female) German adolescent (M = 15.6 + 1.5 years) psychiatric patients completed the DUDIT and received a diagnostic interview (MINI-KID) assessing DSM-5 SUD criteria. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the area under the curve (AUC), and Youden's Index were calculated. RESULTS: A two-factor model of the DUDIT shows the best model fit (CFI = 0.995, SRMR = 0.055, RMSEA = 0.059, WRMR = 0.603). The DUDIT as well as the DUDIT-C show high diagnostic accuracy, with AUC = 0.95 and AUC = 0.88, respectively. For the DUDIT a cut-off value of 8.5 was optimal (sensitivity = 0.93, specificity = 0.91, J = 0.84), while for the DUDIT-C the optimal cut-off value was at 1.5 (sensitivity = 0.86, specificity = 0.84, J = 0.70). CONCLUSION: This is the first psychometric evaluation of the DUDIT in German, adolescent psychiatric outpatients, using the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The DUDIT as well as the DUDIT-C are well suited for use in this population. Since in our sample only few patients presented with a mild or moderate SUD, our results need to be replicated in a sample of adolescents with mild SUD.",2021,2021/06/04,Front Psychol,12,,678819,34149570.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.678819,,#224,Basedow 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Munich Alliance Against Depression,"Mergl, R.; Heinz, I.; Allgaier, A. K.; Hegerl, U.","Background: A four-level community-based intervention aiming simultaneously to improve the care for depression and to prevent suicidal behavior has been implemented in the German city Munich. Aims: Changes in suicide rates in Munich during 2009-2014 were analyzed with respect to a 10-year baseline. The same was true for a control region (Cologne) and Germany minus Munich. Method: The interventions included training of primary care providers, a public awareness campaign, training of community facilitators, and support for patients and relatives. Analyses included repeated-measures, generalized linear models. Results: In Munich, the suicide rate significantly decreased during the intervention period compared to baseline (percentage change = -15.0%; p < .001, 198 compared to 222 suicides per year). Differences in the change for Munich and the change for the control locations (Cologne; -1.7%; p = .71) and Germany minus Munich (-6.2%; p = .09) were not significant. Limitations: Data on suicide attempts were unavailable. Conclusion: In Munich, a clinically and statistically significant decrease in suicide rate was found. This change was numerically but not significantly larger than in the control regions. The results are promising, however. Because of low suicide base rates and limited power, no strong conclusions can be drawn concerning suicide preventive effects of the intervention.",2022,Jun 27,Crisis,,,,35757934.0,10.1027/0227-5910/a000870,,#225,Mergl 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Negative Effects of a Multimodal Inpatient CBASP Program: Rate of Occurrence and Their Impact on Treatment Outcome in Chronic and Treatment-Resistant Depression,"Herzog, P.; Hausler, S.; Normann, C.; Brakemeier, E. L.","Background: A growing number of studies indicate that the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) is effective in treating chronic depression. However, there is no systematic research into possible negative effects. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to investigate the rate of occurrence of negative effects of an inpatient CBASP program and their impact on treatment response. Methods: Patients with chronic depression and treatment resistance who completed the 12-week multimodal inpatient CBASP treatment program in an open trial (N = 52) retrospectively completed the Inventory for the Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy (INEP) during follow-up data collection. Severity of depressive symptoms was assessed self- and observer-rated at admission, discharge, and 6 months follow-up. Rates of occurrence of negative effects were calculated and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship to treatment outcome. Results: The results indicate that 92.3% of patients reported having experienced at least one negative effect and 45.2% indicated dependence on their therapist. Stigmatization and financial concerns as well as intrapersonal changes were reported by about one-third. Only dependence on the therapist negatively impacted treatment outcome in both outcome measures. Conclusions: While almost all patients reported at least one negative effect of a multimodal inpatient CBASP treatment program, most of the reported negative effects appear to be benign. However, dependence on the therapist seems to have a negative impact on treatment outcome. If these results can be replicated in future large-scale, randomized controlled prospective studies, CBASP therapists should be aware of possible dependence and consciously address it during treatment.",2021,2021/08/09,Front Psychiatry,12,,575837,34434122.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2021.575837,,#226,Herzog 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Lifestyle choices and mental health: a longitudinal survey with German and Chinese students,"Velten, J.; Bieda, A.; Scholten, S.; Wannemuller, A.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: A healthy lifestyle can be beneficial for one's mental health. Thus, identifying healthy lifestyle choices that promote psychological well-being and reduce mental problems is useful to prevent mental disorders. The aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the predictive values of a broad range of lifestyle choices for positive mental health (PMH) and mental health problems (MHP) in German and Chinese students. METHOD: Data were assessed at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. Samples included 2991 German (M(age) = 21.69, SD = 4.07) and 12,405 Chinese (M(age) = 20.59, SD = 1.58) university students. Lifestyle choices were body mass index, frequency of physical and mental activities, frequency of alcohol consumption, smoking, vegetarian diet, and social rhythm irregularity. PMH and MHP were measured with the Positive Mental Health Scale and a 21-item version of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale. The predictive values of lifestyle choices for PMH and MHP at baseline and follow-up were assessed with single-group and multi-group path analyses. RESULTS: Better mental health (higher PMH and fewer MHP) at baseline was predicted by a lower body mass index, a higher frequency of physical and mental activities, non-smoking, a non-vegetarian diet, and a more regular social rhythm. When controlling for baseline mental health, age, and gender, physical activity was a positive predictor of PMH, smoking was a positive predictor of MHP, and a more irregular social rhythm was a positive predictor of PMH and a negative predictor of MHP at follow-up. The good fit of a multi-group model indicated that most lifestyle choices predict mental health comparably across samples. Some country-specific effects emerged: frequency of alcohol consumption, for example, predicted better mental health in German and poorer mental health in Chinese students. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underline the importance of healthy lifestyle choices for improved psychological well-being and fewer mental health difficulties. Effects of lifestyle on mental health are comparable in German and Chinese students. Some healthy lifestyle choices (i.e., more frequent physical activity, non-smoking, regular social rhythm) are related to improvements in mental health over a 1-year period.",2018,May 16,BMC Public Health,18,1,632,29769115.0,10.1186/s12889-018-5526-2,,#227,Velten 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Optimizing expectations and distraction leads to lower cortisol levels after acute stress,"Salzmann, S.; Euteneuer, F.; Strahler, J.; Laferton, J. A. C.; Nater, U. M.; Rief, W.","BACKGROUND: A new approach of psychological interventions prior to stress aiming to optimize expectations may have beneficial effects on a person's health status by reducing physiological stress. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a brief psychological intervention designed to optimize personal control expectations prior to acute stress would affect perceived and biological stress responsiveness in comparison to two more established interventions (fostering gratitude or distraction) in a healthy sample. METHODS: 74 healthy participants were randomized to one of three psychological interventions prior to stress: (i) writing about ways to influence stress to optimize personal control expectations (EXPECTATION), (ii) writing a gratitude-letter (GRATITUDE) (iii) or a distraction writing task (DISTRACTION). After completing the intervention, the Maastricht acute stress test was administered to induce (psychosocial and physiological) stress. Assessments took place at baseline, post-intervention (15 min writing task) and after stress induction (additional salivary assessments: 15 and 30 min after stress). Main outcomes were expectations, emotions, perceived stress, salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase. Personality traits (eg, optimism) were assessed at baseline. RESULTS: EXPECTATION specifically increased personal control expectations (p = .016, d = .72) and GRATITUDE specifically increased gratitude (p = .026, d = .68). EXPECTATION and DISTRACTION led to lower cortisol concentrations after stress induction than GRATITUDE (time x group interaction: p < .001, d = .88). We detected no intervention effects on alpha-amylase or perceived stress. Optimism moderated intervention effects on cortisol (p = .023, d = .74).

Pain assessment for cognitively impaired older adults: Do items of available observer tools reflect pain-specific responses?,"Kappesser, J.; Voit, S.; Lautenbacher, S.; Hermann, C.","BACKGROUND: A number of observational tools are available to assess pain in cognitively impaired older adults, however, none of them can yet be regarded as a ""gold standard"". An international research initiative has created a meta-tool compiling the facial, vocalization and body movement items of the majority of available tools. Objective of this study was to investigate the pain specificity and the validity of these items. METHOD: N = 34 older adults with or without cognitive impairment were videotaped in three different conditions (one reference, two painful conditions) in their nursing homes. They were further asked to self-report their pain in each condition. The occurrence of non-verbal behaviours was coded as present or absent using the items of the meta-tool. RESULTS: The majority of non-verbal behaviours was not pain sensitive as they occurred less than three times across participants and conditions. Of the remaining items, two facial items (""pained expression"" and ""raising upper lip""), one vocalization item (""using pain-related words"") and one body movement item (""guarding"") were found to be pain specific and valid. One additional item, the vocalization item ""gasping"", was pain specific, but not associated with pain self-report, and three additional items, the facial items ""frowning"" and ""narrowing eyes"" and the vocalization item ""mumbling"" were correlated with pain self-report but did not help to separate pain from non-pain conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic evaluation of items of existing observational pain assessment tools under naturalistic conditions seems a promising approach in the process of further investigating and improving tools. SIGNIFICANCE: Only few items stemming from observational pain assessment tools were found to be pain sensitive and specific as well as valid in this study. The investigation of existing tools not only on tool but additionally on item-level can provide helpful insights and thereby can help to improve the original tools and establish a gold standard for nonverbal pain assessment in older adults with cognitive impairments.",2020,Apr,Eur J Pain,24,4,851-862,31981281.0,10.1002/ejp.1536,,#229,Kappesser 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The Hold me Tight Program for Couples Facing Huntington's Disease,"Petzke, T. M.; Rodriguez-Girondo, M.; van der Meer, L. B.","BACKGROUND: A positive predictive genetic test for Huntington's disease (HD) can be a life-changing event for both carriers and their partners, leading to lower wellbeing and increasing the risk for separation and divorce. The 'Hold me Tight' program (HmT), based on emotionally focused couples' therapy, aims at strengthening the couple bond by targeting attachment needs. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether the HmT program helps couples strengthen their relationship, as an investment in a future where the disease will affect life in many ways. METHODS: In a multiple baseline design using three baselines of varying length, 15 couples of presymptomatic HD-carriers and their partners were included. In three consecutive groups, couples underwent the intervention (an adapted version of the 8-session HmT program) in four weekly sessions and completed self-report questionnaires throughout the study period of 19 weeks (17 measurements). Attachment style was assessed at baseline, resilience at baseline and at the end of the follow-up, while relationship satisfaction and wellbeing were measured weekly. A multi-level model was applied to the data. RESULTS: Over the course of the study, wellbeing and relationship satisfaction significantly improved; resilience, however, did not. Furthermore, all three outcome measures were moderated by attachment style, with more securely attached individuals showing better outcomes. CONCLUSION: HmT improved wellbeing and relationship satisfaction of couples facing HD. Due to these improvements and high patient acceptability rates, this program could become a standardized procedure in HD care. The program could be adapted for other populations, e.g., couples facing other genetic neurological disorders.",2022,2022/06/03,J Huntingtons Dis,11,2,203-215,35466944.0,10.3233/JHD-210516,,#230,Petzke 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The effect of educational information about treatments for schizophrenia on stigmatizing perceptions,"Schlier, B.; Lange, P.; Wiese, S.; Wirth, A.; Lincoln, T.","BACKGROUND: A promising strategy for reducing stigmatizing perceptions towards people with schizophrenia is education about treatment and recovery. The effects of different kinds of treatment information on stigmatizing perceptions, however, have yet to be compared directly. This study compared three different educational interventions focusing on medication, CBT, and psychodynamic psychotherapy in their potential to reduce stigmatizing perceptions towards people with schizophrenia. METHODS: In an online experiment 178 participants received one of three psychoeducation texts that focused on medication, CBT or psychodynamic therapy. The effects on stereotypical beliefs about psychosis (dangerousness, unpredictability, blame, prognostic pessimism) and emotional responses towards people with schizophrenia (anxiety, anger, sympathy) were tested. RESULTS: Perceptions of dangerousness, unpredictability, and anxiety towards people with schizophrenia were reduced in all conditions. Prognostic pessimism was reduced only after reading the CBT information. LIMITATIONS: No neutral control group was included. The sample was not representative with respect to level of education or gender. CONCLUSIONS: Stigmatizing perceptions may be reduced by receiving information about any type of treatment for psychosis and without producing negative side-effects, although this needs to be replicated in a controlled study. However, information on CBT seems most suitable to reduce stigma, since it was able to reduce prognostic pessimism.",2016,Sep,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,52,,11-16,26949924.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2016.02.002,,#231,Schlier 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

L.","BACKGROUND: A routinely collected big data set was analyzed to determine the effectiveness of naturalistic inpatient treatment and to identify predictors of treatment outcome and discontinuation. METHODS: The sample included 878 patients with borderline personality disorder who received non-manualized dialectic behavioral therapy in a psychosomatic clinic. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) were calculated to determine effectiveness. A bootstrap-enhanced regularized regression with 91 potential predictors was used to identify stable predictors of residualized symptom- and functional change and treatment discontinuation. Results were validated in a holdout sample and repeated cross validation. RESULTS: Effect sizes were small to medium (g = 0.28-0.51). Positive symptom-related outcome was predicted by low affect regulation skills and no previous outpatient psychotherapy. Lower age, absence of work disability, high emotional and physical role limitations and low bodily pain were associated with greater improvement in functional outcome. Higher education and comorbid recurrent depressive disorder were the main predictors of treatment completion. The predictive quality of the models varied, with the best being found for symptom-related outcome (R(2) = 18%).

Inpatient psychotherapy for depression in a large routine clinical care sample: A Bayesian approach to examining clinical outcomes and predictors of change,"Herzog, P.; Feldmann, M.; Kube, T.; Langs, G.; Gartner, T.; Rauh, E.; Doerr, R.; Hillert, A.; Voderholzer, U.; Rief, W.; Endres, D.; Brakemeier, E. L.","BACKGROUND: A routinely collected dataset was analyzed (1) to determine the naturalistic effectiveness of inpatient psychotherapy for depression in routine psychotherapeutic care, and (2) to identify potential predictors of change. METHODS: In a sample of 22,681 inpatients with depression, pre-post and pre-follow-up effect sizes were computed for various outcome variables. To build a probabilistic model of predictors of change, an independent component analysis generated components from demographic and clinical data, and Bayesian EFA extracted factors from the available pre-test, post-test and follow-up questionnaires in a subsample (N = 6377). To select the best-fitted model, the BIC of different path models were compared. A Bayesian path analysis was performed to identify the most important factors to predict changes. RESULTS: Effect sizes were large for the primary outcome and moderate for various secondary outcomes. Almost all pretreatment factors exerted significant influences on different baseline factors. Several factors were found to be resistant to change during treatment: suicidality, agoraphobia, life dissatisfaction, physical disability and pain. The strongest cross-loadings were observed from suicidality on negative cognitions, from agoraphobia on anxiety, and from physical disability on perceived disability. LIMITATIONS: No causal conclusions can be drawn directly from our results as we only used cross-lagged panel data without control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate large effects of inpatient psychotherapy for depression in routine clinical care.

The factors underlying this reduction are not yet fully understood. Reward salience and reward expectancy have been discussed as factors that potentially influence approach behaviour. The aim of this study was thus to test their effects on behaviour in an effort-based decision-making paradigm. METHODS: In two studies with community samples we applied a modified version of the Balloon Task. In study 1, we manipulated reward salience in a within-subject design (N = 32) by highlighting the monetary rewards. In study 2, we manipulated reward expectancy in a between-subject design (N = 72) by adding five practice trials with either positive or negative feedback prior to the task. RESULTS: The salience of rewards manipulation significantly increased effort expenditure and the allocation of effort to the level of rewards whereas the reward expectancy manipulation did not. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that increasing the salience of rewards increases motivated behaviour in an effort-based decision-making paradigm offers promising possibilities for intervention in disorders characterised by motivational deficits, such asaffective and psychotic disorders.",2022,Jan,Cogn Neuropsychiatry,27,1,20-34,34812121.0,10.1080/13546805.2021.2007068,,#234,Renz 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Efficacy of an outpatient treatment for prolonged grief disorder: a randomized controlled clinical trial,"Rosner, R.; Pfoh, G.; Kotoucova, M.; Hagl, M.","BACKGROUND: Abnormal forms of grief, currently referred to as complicated grief or prolonged grief disorder, have been discussed extensively in recent years. While the diagnostic criteria are still debated, there is no doubt that prolonged grief is disabling and may require treatment. To date, few interventions have demonstrated efficacy. METHODS: We investigated whether outpatients suffering from prolonged grief disorder (PGD) benefit from a newly developed integrative cognitive behavioural therapy for prolonged grief (PG-CBT). A total of 51 patients were randomized into two groups, stratified by the type of death and their relationship to the deceased; 24 patients composed the treatment group and 27 patients composed the wait list control group (WG). Treatment consisted of 20-25 sessions. Main outcome was change in grief severity; secondary outcomes were reductions in general psychological distress and in comorbidity. RESULTS: Patients on average had 2.5 comorbid diagnoses in addition to PGD. Between group effect sizes were large for the improvement of grief symptoms in treatment completers (Cohen׳s d=1.61) and in the intent-to-treat analysis (d=1.32). Comorbid depressive symptoms also improved in PG-CBT compared to WG. The completion rate was 79% in PG-CBT and 89% in WG. LIMITATIONS: The major limitations of this study were a small sample size and that PG-CBT took longer than the waiting time.

Abnormalities in white matter tracts in the fronto-striatal-thalamic circuit are associated with verbal performance in 22q11.2DS,"Heller, C.; Steinmann, S.; Levitt, J. J.; Makris, N.; Antshel, K. M.; Fremont, W.; Coman, I. L.; Schweinberger, S. R.; Weiss, T.; Bouix, S.; Kubicki, M. R.; Kates, W. R.; Kikinis, Z.","BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in fronto-striatal-thalamic (FST) sub-circuits are present in schizophrenia and are associated with cognitive impairments. However, it remains unknown whether abnormalities in FST sub-circuits are present before psychosis onset. This may be elucidated by investigating 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a genetic syndrome associated with a 30% risk for developing schizophrenia in adulthood and a decline in Verbal IQ (VIQ) preceding psychosis onset. Here, we examined white matter (WM) tracts in FST sub-circuits, especially those in the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) sub-circuits, and their associations with VIQ in young adults with 22q11DS. METHODS: Diffusion MRI scans were acquired from 21 individuals with 22q11DS with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia, 30 individuals with 22q11DS without prodromal symptoms, and 30 healthy controls (mean age: 21 +/- 2 years). WM tracts were reconstructed between striatum and thalamus with rostral middle frontal gyrus (rMFG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), representing DLPFC and VLPFC respectively. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (RD) were used for group comparisons. VIQ was assessed and associations with the diffusion measures were evaluated. RESULTS: FA was significantly increased and RD decreased in most tracts of the DLPFC and VLPFC sub-circuits in 22q11DS. Verbal IQ scores correlated negatively with FA and, at trend level, positively with RD in the right thalamus-IFG tract in 22q11DS with prodromal symptoms.

Predicting patients who will drop out of out-patient psychotherapy using machine learning algorithms,"Bennemann, B.; Schwartz, B.; Giesemann, J.; Lutz, W.","BACKGROUND: About 30% of patients drop out of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), which has implications for psychiatric and psychological treatment. Findings concerning drop out remain heterogeneous. AIMS: This paper aims to compare different machine-learning algorithms using nested cross-validation, evaluate their benefit in naturalistic settings, and identify the best model as well as the most important variables. METHOD: The data-set consisted of 2543 out-patients treated with CBT. Assessment took place before session one. Twenty-one algorithms and ensembles were compared. Two parameters (Brier score, area under the curve (AUC)) were used for evaluation. RESULTS: The best model was an ensemble that used Random Forest and nearest-neighbour modelling. During the training process, it was significantly better than generalised linear modelling (GLM) (Brier score: d = -2.93, 95% CI (-3.95, -1.90)); AUC: d = 0.59, 95% CI (0.11 to 1.06)). In the holdout sample, the ensemble was able to correctly identify 63.4% of cases of patients, whereas the GLM only identified 46.2% correctly. The most important predictors were lower education, lower scores on the Personality Style and Disorder Inventory (PSSI) compulsive scale, younger age, higher scores on the PSSI negativistic and PSSI antisocial scale as well as on the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) additional scale (mean of the four additional items) and BSI overall scale.

Healthy women with severe early life trauma show altered neural facilitation of emotion inhibition under acute stress,"Golde, S.; Wingenfeld, K.; Riepenhausen, A.; Schroter, N.; Fleischer, J.; Prussner, J.; Grimm, S.; Fan, Y.; Hellmann-Regen, J.; Beck, A.; Gold, S. M.; Otte, C.","BACKGROUND: Across psychopathologies, trauma-exposed individuals suffer from difficulties in inhibiting emotions and regulating attention. In trauma-exposed individuals without psychopathology, only subtle alterations of neural activity involved in regulating emotions have been reported. It remains unclear how these neural systems react to demanding environments, when acute (non-traumatic but ordinary) stress serves to perturbate the system. Moreover, associations with subthreshold clinical symptoms are poorly understood. METHODS: The present fMRI study investigated response inhibition of emotional faces before and after psychosocial stress situations. Specifically, it compared 25 women (mean age 31.5 +/- 9.7 years) who had suffered severe early life trauma but who did not have a history of or current psychiatric disorder, with 25 age- and education-matched trauma-naive women. RESULTS: Under stress, response inhibition related to fearful faces was reduced in both groups. Compared to controls, trauma-exposed women showed decreased left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) activation under stress when inhibiting responses to fearful faces, while activation of the right anterior insula was slightly increased. Also, groups differed in brain-behaviour correlations. Whereas stress-induced false alarm rates on fearful stimuli negatively correlated with stress-induced IFG signal in controls, in trauma-exposed participants, they positively correlated with stress-induced insula activation. CONCLUSION: Neural facilitation of emotion inhibition during stress appears to be altered in trauma-exposed women, even without a history of or current psychopathology. Decreased activation of the IFG in concert with heightened bottom-up salience of fear related cues may increase vulnerability to stress-related diseases.",2020,Sep,Psychol Med,50,12,2075-2084,31462343.0,10.1017/S0033291719002198,,#240,Golde 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"Relationship between sense of control, psychological burden, sources of information and adherence to anti-COVID-19 rules","Brailovskaia, J.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: Adherence to anti-COVID-19 rules is important to slow down the pandemic spread. The present study investigated potential predictors of the adherence. METHODS: Data of 1.247 participants from Germany (age: M (SD) = 22.99 (6.18)) were assessed via online surveys in autumn and winter 2020. The focus of the data collection was on adherence to anti-COVID-19 rules, sense of control, psychological burden, and sources of COVID-19 information. RESULTS: In moderated mediation analyses, the positive relationship between sense of control and adherence to anti-COVID-19 rules was significantly mediated by the level of psychological burden experienced by the COVID-19 situation. The source of COVID-19 information significantly moderated the negative association between burden and adherence. Specifically, the higher the use of social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) and the lower the use of official governmental sites and of television reports, the closer the link between high burden and low adherence. LIMITATIONS: Due to the cross-sectional study design, the present findings allow only hypothetical assumptions of causality.

Self-reported PTSD is associated with increased use of MDMA in adolescents with substance use disorders,"Basedow, L. A.; Kuitunen-Paul, S.; Wiedmann, M. F.; Roessner, V.; Golub, Y.","BACKGROUND: Adolescent patients with a substance use disorder (SUD) often fulfil the criteria for a co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, it is not clear if these dual-diagnosed adolescents present with unique levels of substance use and how their substance use relates to PTSD symptom clusters. OBJECTIVE: To investigate substance use in adolescents with co-occurring PTSD and SUD. Additionally, we explored how the use of specific substances is related to specific PTSD symptom clusters. METHOD: We recruited n = 121 German adolescent SUD patients, in three groups: no history of traumatic events (TEs) (n = 35), TEs but not PTSD (n = 48), probable PTSD (n = 38). All groups were administered a trauma questionnaire and were asked to report their past-month substance use. RESULTS: Adolescents with probable PTSD and SUD report a higher frequency of MDMA use than adolescents with no PTSD and no TE (PTSD vs. noTE: U = 510.5, p = .016; PTSD vs. TE: U = 710.0, p = .010). The use of MDMA was more frequent in adolescents with avoidance symptoms (X(2) (1) = 6.0, p = .014). Participants report using substances at a younger age (PTSD vs. noTE: U = 372.0, p = .001; PTSD vs. TE: U = 653.5, p = .022) and PTSD symptom onset was on average 2.2 years earlier than first MDMA use (t (26) = -2.89, p = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent SUD patients with probable PTSD are more likely to use MDMA than SUD patients without PTSD. The use of MDMA was associated with reported avoidance symptoms. The first age of MDMA use is initiated after PTSD onset. It is unclear whether the association of MDMA use with avoidance symptoms is due to efforts to reduce these symptoms or a result of regular MDMA use.",2021,2021/01/01,Eur J Psychotraumatol,12,1,1968140,34603636.0,10.1080/20008198.2021.1968140,,#244,Basedow 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Feasibility and potential efficacy of a guided internet- and mobile-based CBT for adolescents and young adults with chronic medical conditions and comorbid depression or anxiety symptoms (youthCOACH(CD)): a randomized controlled pilot trial,"Geirhos, A.; Domhardt, M.; Lunkenheimer, F.; Temming, S.; Holl, R. W.; Minden, K.; Warschburger, P.; Meissner, T.; Mueller-Stierlin, A. S.; Baumeister, H.","BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with a chronic medical condition show an increased risk for developing mental comorbidities compared to their healthy peers. Internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) might be a low-threshold treatment to support affected AYA. In this randomized controlled pilot trial, the feasibility and potential efficacy of youthCOACH(CD), an iCBT targeting symptoms of anxiety and depression in AYA with chronic medical conditions, was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 30 AYA (M(age) 16.13; SD= 2.34; 73% female), aged 12-21 years either suffering from cystic fibrosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis or type 1 diabetes, were randomly assigned to either a guided version of the iCBT youthCOACH(CD) (IG, n=15) or to a waitlist control group (CG, n=15), receiving an unguided version of the iCBT six months post-randomization. Participants of the IG and the CG were assessed before (t0), twelve weeks after (t1) and six months after (t2) randomization. Primary outcome was the feasibility of the iCBT. Different parameters of feasibility e.g. acceptance, client satisfaction or potential side effects were evaluated. First indications of the possible efficacy with regard to the primary efficacy outcome, the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale, and further outcome variables were evaluated using linear regression models, adjusting for baseline values. RESULTS: Regarding feasibility, intervention completion was 60%; intervention satisfaction (M = 25.42, SD = 5.85) and perceived therapeutic alliance (M = 2.83, SD = 1.25) were moderate and comparable to other iCBTs. No patterns emerged regarding subjective and objective negative side effects due to participation in youthCOACH(CD). Estimates of potential efficacy showed between group differences, with a potential medium-term benefit of youthCOACH(CD) (beta = -0.55, 95%CI: -1.17; 0.07), but probably not short-term (beta = 0.20, 95%CI: -0.47; 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to the feasibility of youthCOACH(CD) and the implementation of a future definitive randomized controlled trial addressing its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Due to the small sample size, conclusions are premature, however, further strategies to foster treatment adherence should be considered.

Long term efficacy of developmentally adapted cognitive processing therapy in youth with abuse related PTSD - Follow-up of a randomized control trial,"Steil, R.; Weiss, J.; Rimane, E.; Renneberg, B.; Rosner, R.","BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults with abuse-related post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to benefit from Developmentally Adapted Cognitive Processing Therapy (D-CPT), yet long-term efficacy of D-CPT has not yet been studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term efficacy of D-CPT in a sample of adolescents and young adults (age 14-21 years) with childhood abuse related PTSD. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Patients of a previously conducted multicenter randomized controlled trial which showed the efficacy of D-CPT compared to a waitlist with treatment advice (WL/TA) were invited for follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months after the end of treatment. METHODS: Primary outcome was the PTSD symptom severity, assessed with the Clinician-administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents (CAPS-CA). Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD severity, depression, borderline symptom severity, behavior problems, and dissociation. RESULTS: Of the 44 participants who received D-CPT, 28 (63 %) responded and were assessed at 6-month follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 22 participants (50 %) responded. The majority of participants in the WL/TA group received D-CPT after the end of the trial and were hence not available for follow-up assessment. In the D-CPT group, treatment gains were maintained at 6- and 12-month follow-up in the CAPS-CA as well as in all secondary outcomes.

Impaired Emotional Mirroring in Parkinson's Disease-A Study on Brain Activation during Processing of Facial Expressions,"Pohl, A.; Anders, S.; Chen, H.; Patel, H. J.; Heller, J.; Reetz, K.; Mathiak, K.; Binkofski, F.","BACKGROUND: Affective dysfunctions are common in patients with Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neurobiological deviations have rarely been examined. Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in impairment of motor and non-motor basal ganglia-cortical loops. Concerning emotional deficits, some studies provide evidence for altered brain processing in limbic- and lateral-orbitofrontal gating loops. In a second line of evidence, human premotor and inferior parietal homologs of mirror neuron areas were involved in processing and understanding of emotional facial expressions. We examined deviations in brain activation during processing of facial expressions in patients and related these to emotion recognition accuracy. METHODS: 13 patients and 13 healthy controls underwent an emotion recognition task and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement. In the Emotion Hexagon test, participants were presented with blends of two emotions and had to indicate which emotion best described the presented picture. Blended pictures with three levels of difficulty were included. During fMRI scanning, participants observed video clips depicting emotional, non-emotional, and neutral facial expressions or were asked to produce these facial expressions themselves. RESULTS: Patients performed slightly worse in the emotion recognition task, but only when judging the most ambiguous facial expressions. Both groups activated inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal homologs of mirror neuron areas during observation and execution of the emotional facial expressions. During observation, responses in the pars opercularis of the right inferior frontal gyrus, in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule and in the bilateral supplementary motor cortex were decreased in patients. Furthermore, in patients, activation of the right anterior inferior parietal lobule was positively related to accuracy in the emotion recognition task. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence for a contribution of human homologs of monkey mirror areas to the emotion recognition deficit in Parkinson's disease.",2017,2017/12/18,Front Neurol,8,,682,29326646.0,10.3389/fneur.2017.00682,,#248,Pohl 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Brain structural correlates of alexithymia in patients with major depressive disorder,"Forster, K.; Enneking, V.; Dohm, K.; Redlich, R.; Meinert, S.; Geisler, A. I.; Leehr, E. J.; Kugel, H.; Baune, B. T.; Arolt, V.; Zwitserlood, P.; Grotegerd, D.; Dannlowski, U.","BACKGROUND: Alexithymia is a risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been associated with diminished treatment response. Neuroimaging studies have revealed structural aberrations of the anterior cingulate cortex and the fusiform gyrus in healthy controls with high levels of alexithymia. The present study tried to corroborate and extend these results to patients with MDD compared with healthy controls. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between alexithymia, depression and grey matter volume in 63 patients with MDD (mean age +/- standard deviation = 42.43 yr +/- 11.91; 33 female) and 46 healthy controls (45.35 yr +/- 8.37; 22 female). We assessed alexithymia using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. We conducted an alexithymia x group analysis of covariance; we used a region-of-interest approach, including the fusiform gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex, and conducted whole brain analysis using voxelbased morphometry. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significant alexithymia x group interaction in the fusiform gyrus (left, pFWE = 0.031; right, pFWE = 0.010). Higher alexithymia scores were associated with decreased grey matter volume in patients with MDD (pFWE = 0.009), but with increased grey matter volume of the fusiform gyrus in healthy controls (pFWE = 0.044). We found no significant main effects in the region-of-interest analysis. LIMITATIONS: Owing to the naturalistic nature of our study, patients with MDD and healthy controls differed significantly in their alexithymia scores. CONCLUSION: Our results showed the fusiform gyrus as a correlate of alexithymia. We also found differences related to alexithymia between patients with MDD and healthy controls in the fusiform gyrus.

"Alexithymic Trait, Painful Heat Stimulation, and Everyday Pain Experience","Pollatos, O.; Dietel, A.; Gundel, H.; Duschek, S.","BACKGROUND: Alexithymia was found to be associated with a variety of somatic complaints, including somatoform pain symptoms. This study addressed the question of whether the different facets of alexithymia are related to responses in heat pain stimulation and its interrelations with levels of everyday pain as assessed by self-report. METHODS: In the study, sensitivity to heat pain was assessed in 50 healthy female participants. Alexithymia facets were assessed by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Pain threshold and tolerance were determined using a testing the limits procedure. Participants, furthermore, rated subjective intensities and unpleasantness of tonic heat stimuli (45.5-47.5 degrees C) on visual analog scales and on a questionnaire. Possible confounding with temperature sensitivity and mood was controlled. Everyday pain was assessed by self-report addressing everyday pain frequency, intensity, and impairment experienced over the last 2 months. RESULTS: Main results were that the facets of alexithymia were differentially associated with pain perception. The affective scale ""difficulties in describing feelings"" was associated with hyposensitivity to pain as indicated by higher pain tolerance scores. Furthermore, everyday pain frequency was related to increased alexithymia values on the affective scale ""difficulties in identifying feelings,"" whereas higher values on the cognitive alexithymia scale ""externally oriented thinking"" were related to lower pain impairment and intensity. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the different facets of alexithymia are related to alternations in pain processing. Further research on clinical samples is necessary to elucidate whether different aspects of alexithymia act as a vulnerability factor for the development of pain symptoms.",2015,2015/10/07,Front Psychiatry,6,,139,26500561.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00139,,#251,Pollatos 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Ventral Striatal-Hippocampus Coupling During Reward Processing as a Stratification Biomarker for Psychotic Disorders,"Schwarz, K.; Moessnang, C.; Schweiger, J.

H.; Rietschel, M.; Nothen, M.; Degenhardt, F.; Wackerhagen, C.; Erk, S.; Romanczuk-Seiferth, N.; Walter, H.; Tost, H.; Meyer-Lindenberg, A.","BACKGROUND: Altered ventral striatal (vST) activation to reward expectancy is a well-established intermediate phenotype for psychiatric disorders, specifically schizophrenia (SZ). Preclinical research suggests that striatal alterations are related to a reduced inhibition by the hippocampal formation, but its role in human transdiagnostic reward-network dysfunctions is not well understood. METHODS: We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging during reward processing in 728 individuals including healthy control subjects (n = 396), patients (SZ: n = 46; bipolar disorder: n = 45; major depressive disorder: n = 60), and unaffected first-degree relatives (SZ: n = 46; bipolar disorder: n = 50; major depressive disorder: n = 85). We assessed disorder-specific differences in functional vST-hippocampus coupling and transdiagnostic associations with dimensional measures of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. We also probed the genetic underpinning using polygenic risk scores for SZ in a subset of healthy participants (n = 295). RESULTS: Functional vST-hippocampus coupling was 1) reduced in patients with SZ and bipolar disorder (p(FWE) < .05, small-volume corrected [SVC]); 2) associated transdiagnostically to dimensional measures of positive (p(FWE) = .01, SVC) and cognitive (p(FWE) = .02, SVC), but not negative, (p(FWE) > .05, SVC) symptoms; and 3) reduced in first-degree relatives of patients with SZ (p(FWE) = .017, SVC) and linked to the genetic risk for SZ in healthy participants (p = .035). CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that reduced vST-hippocampus coupling during reward processing is an endophenotype for SZ linked to positive and cognitive symptoms, supporting current preclinical models of the emergence of psychosis. Moreover, our data indicate that vST-hippocampus coupling is familial and linked to polygenic scores for SZ, supporting the use of this measure as an intermediate phenotype for psychotic disorders.",2022,Jan 15,Biol Psychiatry,91,2,216-225,34607654.0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2021.07.016,,#252,Schwarz 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Differentiating early-onset chronic depression from episodic depression in terms of cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance,"Brockmeyer, T.; Kulessa, D.; Hautzinger, M.; Bents, H.; Backenstrass, M.","BACKGROUND: Although chronic depression is associated with lower global functioning and poorer treatment response than episodic depression, little is known about the differences between these two forms of depression in terms of psychological factors. Thus, the present study aimed at differentiating chronic and episodic depression regarding cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance that have been proposed as important risk factors for depression and promising targets for the treatment of depression. METHODS: Thirty patients with early onset chronic depression were compared with 30 patients with episodic depression and 30 healthy, never-depressed controls in terms of self-reported cognitive-behavioral (social and non-social) and emotional avoidance. RESULTS: Chronically depressed patients reported more avoidance than healthy controls in each of the measures. Moreover, they reported more cognitive-nonsocial and behavioral-nonsocial as well as behavioral-social and emotional avoidance (in the form of restricted emotional expression to others) than patients with episodic depression. This kind of emotional avoidance also separated best between chronically and episodically depressed patients. Furthermore, general emotion avoidance and behavioral-social avoidance were positively correlated with levels of depression in chronically depressed patients. LIMITATIONS: The results are based on self-report data and should thus be interpreted with caution. Additionally, the cross-sectional design limits any causal conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the relevance of cognitive-behavioral and emotional avoidance in differentiating chronic from episodic depression and healthy controls and advocate a stronger focus on maladaptive avoidance processes in the treatment of chronic depression.",2015,Apr 1,J Affect Disord,175,,418-23,25679196.0,10.1016/j.jad.2015.01.045,,#254,Brockmeyer 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Error-related activity of the sensorimotor network contributes to the prediction of response to cognitive-behavioral therapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Grutzmann, R.; Klawohn, J.; Elsner, B.; Reuter, B.; Kaufmann, C.; Riesel, A.; Bey, K.; Heinzel, S.; Kathmann, N.","BACKGROUND: Although cognitive behavioral therapy is a highly effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), yielding large symptom reductions on the group level, individual treatment response varies considerably. Identification of treatment response predictors may provide important information for maximizing individual treatment response and thus achieving efficient treatment resource allocation. Here, we investigated the predictive value of previously identified biomarkers of OCD, namely the error-related activity of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the sensorimotor network (SMN, postcentral gyrus/precuneus). METHODS: Seventy-two participants with a primary diagnosis of OCD underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning while performing a flanker task prior to receiving routine-care CBT. RESULTS: Error-related BOLD response of the SMN significantly contributed to the prediction of treatment response beyond the variance accounted for by clinical and sociodemographic variables. Stronger error-related SMN activity at baseline was associated with a higher likelihood of treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: The present results illustrate that the inclusion of error-related SMN activity can significantly increase treatment response prediction quality in OCD. Stronger error-related activity of the SMN may reflect the ability to activate symptom-relevant processing networks and may thus facilitate response to exposure-based CBT interventions.",2022,,Neuroimage Clin,36,,103216,36208547.0,10.1016/j.nicl.2022.103216,,#255,Grutzmann 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Treatment utilization and treatment barriers in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder,"Schulte, J.; Schulz, C.; Wilhelm, S.; Buhlmann, U.","BACKGROUND: Although effective treatments are available, most individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) do not receive an appropriate diagnosis or treatment. We aimed to examine treatment utilization and barriers to treatment, and to identify associated socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS: German individuals completed an online self-report survey of appearance concerns. A sample of N = 429 individuals met criteria for BDD. We examined the frequency of treatment utilization and barriers, analyzed comparisons between treated and untreated individuals and assessed the relationships of socio-demographic and clinical features with mental health treatment utilization and treatment barriers, respectively. RESULTS: Only 15.2% of the individuals with BDD had been diagnosed with BDD, and lifetime rates of mental health treatment were low (39.9%). Individuals endorsed multiple barriers to mental health treatment, especially shame, low perceived need and a preference for cosmetic and medical treatments. Associated features were identified, including age, a BDD diagnosis, body dysmorphic symptom severity, a likely major depressive disorder, prior cosmetic surgery, and insight. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this largest study to date highlight that BDD is still underrecognized and undertreated even in a country with extensive mental health care and few financial barriers.

It has never been systematically assessed whether psychotherapy, continuation ECT, or antidepressant medication is the most efficacious intervention to maintain initial treatment response. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized clinical trial, 90 inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were treated with right unilateral ultra-brief acute ECT. Electroconvulsive therapy responders received 6 months guideline-based antidepressant medication (MED) and were randomly assigned to add-on therapy with cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT-arm), add-on therapy with ultra-brief pulse continuation electroconvulsive therapy (ECT-arm), or no add-on therapy (MED-arm). After the 6 months of continuation treatment, patients were followed-up for another 6 months. The primary outcome parameter was the proportion of patients who remained well after 12 months. RESULTS: Of 90 MDD patients starting the acute phase, 70% responded and 47% remitted to acute ECT. After 6 months of continuation treatment, significant differences were observed in the three treatment arms with sustained response rates of 77% in the CBT-arm, 40% in the ECT-arm, and 44% in the MED-arm. After 12 months, these differences remained stable with sustained response rates of 65% in the CBT-arm, 28% in the ECT-arm, and 33% in the MED-arm.

Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to investigate gender-related differences in acculturation patterns and their association with mental health (internalizing and externalizing problems). METHODS: Self-reported data of immigrant adolescents (N = 440) aged between 12 and 19 years (M = 16.2; SD = 1.6) was collected in a representative German school survey. Fifty-one percent of the sample were female (n = 224). Almost half of the sample was born in the Former Soviet Union, followed by Poland (9.3%). Sociodemographic variables, acculturation strategies, and internalizing as well as externalizing problems were assessed by questionnaires. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported the four- dimensional model of acculturation styles (assimilation, integration, separation and marginalization). Whereas girls more often showed an integration pattern, boys scored higher on the separation and marginalization scale. After adjusting for age and educational level, regression analyses revealed for both gender that marginalization was associated with more internalizing problems. Separation was related to more externalizing problems.

Severely Burdened Individuals Do Not Need to Be Excluded From Internet-Based and Mobile-Based Stress Management: Effect Modifiers of Treatment Outcomes From Three Randomized Controlled Trials,"Weisel, K. K.; Lehr, D.; Heber, E.; Zarski, A. C.; Berking, M.; Riper, H.; Ebert, D. D.","BACKGROUND: Although internet-based and mobile-based stress management interventions (iSMIs) may be a promising strategy to reach employees suffering from high chronic stress, it remains unknown whether participants with high symptom severity of depression or anxiety also benefit from iSMIs or should be excluded. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of iSMIs in subgroups with high symptom severity and to test whether baseline symptom severity moderates treatment outcome. METHODS: Data from three randomized controlled trials (N=791) were pooled to identify effect modifiers and to evaluate efficacy in subgroups with different levels of initial symptom severity. The outcomes perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS), depression severity (Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale, CES-D), and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS) symptom severity were assessed at baseline, 7-week postassessment, and 6-month follow-up. Potential moderators were tested in predicting differences in the change of outcome in multiple moderation analyses. Simple slope analyses evaluated efficacy of the iSMI comparing the intervention group with the waitlist control group in subgroups with low, moderate, and severe initial symptomology based on means and SDs of the study population. In addition, subgroups with clinical values of depression (CES-D>/=16) and anxiety (HADS>/=8) at baseline were explored, and response rates (RRs; 50% symptom reduction) and symptom-free (SF) status (CES-D<16, HADS<8) were reported. RESULTS: Individuals with high stress (PSS>/=30), depression (CES-D>/=33), anxiety (HADS>/=15), and emotional exhaustion (MBI>/=5.6) benefited significantly from the intervention with great reductions of stress (d(post)=0.86-1.16, d(FU)=0.93-1.35), depression (d(post)=0.69-1.08, d(FU)=0.91-1.19), and anxiety (d(post)=0.79-1.19, d(FU)=1.06-1.21), and effects were sustained at 6-month follow-up. Symptom severity moderated treatment outcomes, as individuals with higher symptom severity at baseline benefited significantly more from the intervention than individuals with lower symptom severity. Furthermore, 82.9% (656/791) of individuals had clinical depression values at baseline, of which significantly more individuals in the intervention group reached at least 50% symptom reduction or fell under clinical cut-off (RR: 29.2%, 93/318; SF: 39.6%, 126/318) compared with the waitlist control group (RR: 8.0%, 27/338; SF: 18.6%, 63/338) at postassessment. Significantly more individuals with clinical anxiety values at baseline (HADS>/=8, 85.3%, 675/791) in the intervention group achieved at least 50% symptom reduction or fell under clinical cut-off (RR: 27.7%, 94/339; SF: 39.8%, 135/339) compared with the WLC (RR: 4.8%, 16/336; SF: 15.5%, 52/336). CONCLUSIONS: Highly burdened individuals benefit greatly from iSMIs and therefore should not be excluded from participation. Stress management may be a valid entry point to reach highly burdened individuals who otherwise may not seek treatment.

The effect of salience of rewards on effort-based decision making in psychotic disorders,"Renz, K. E.; Lincoln, T. M.","BACKGROUND: Although motivational negative symptoms account for reduced functioning and quality of life in individuals with psychotic disorders, the underlying mechanisms are yet not fully understood. Neuroimaging studies suggest that an impaired perception of reward cues could result in a lack of incentive value that then leads to a decrease in goal-directed behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the effect of increasing the salience of reward cues on goal-directed behavior. METHODS: We recruited a sample of n = 30 participants with a psychotic disorder and at least mild negative symptoms and n = 30 healthy controls. We used the Balloon Effort Task, an effort-based decision-making paradigm, to assess amotivation on a behavioral level. We manipulated the salience of rewards in the paradigm by highlighting the monetary rewards in half of the trials. RESULTS: Total effort expenditure did not differ between participants with and without psychotic disorders, but participants with psychotic disorders showed a significantly reduced effort allocation to the level of rewards. The salience of rewards manipulation significantly increased effort expenditure both in participants with psychotic disorders and in the healthy controls, but had no impact on effort allocation. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the salience of reward cues promotes goal-directed behavior.

Indicated Web-Based Prevention for Women With Anorexia Nervosa Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Efficacy Trial,"Jacobi, C.; Vollert, B.; Hutter, K.; von Bloh, P.; Eiterich, N.; Gorlich, D.; Taylor, C. B.","BACKGROUND: Although preventive interventions for eating disorders in general have shown promise, interventions specifically targeting individuals at risk for anorexia nervosa (AN) are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a guided, indicated web-based prevention program for women at risk for AN. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled efficacy trial for women at risk for AN. Assessments were carried out at baseline (before the intervention), after the intervention (10 weeks after baseline), and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups (FUs). A total of 168 women with low body weight (17.5 kg/m(2)</=BMI</=19 kg/m(2)) and high weight concerns or with normal body weight (19 kg/m(2)<BMI</=25 kg/m(2)), high weight concerns, and high restrained eating were recruited from 3 German universities as well as on the web and randomized to Student Bodies-AN (SB-AN; intervention group [IG]) or a wait-list control group (CG). The exclusion criteria were current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-based full-syndrome eating disorders and serious medical or mental problems. The interventions were a cognitive-behavioral guided web-based prevention program (SB-AN) over 10 weeks (IG) and a wait-list CG. The primary outcomes were clinically significant changes in disordered eating attitudes and behaviors and change in BMI at 12-month FU in the group of participants who were underweight. The secondary outcomes were new onset of eating disorders, symptoms of disordered eating, and associated psychopathology. RESULTS: Data were available for 81.5% (137/168) of the women after the intervention and for 69% (116/168) of the women at 12-month FU. At 12-month FU, the IG participants showed larger decreases in Eating Disorder Examination total scores (38/48, 79% vs 33/58, 57%) than the CG participants and the IG participants who were underweight also showed larger clinically relevant increases in BMI (15/31, 49% vs 10/32, 32%) than the CG participants, but these differences were not significant. In addition, after the intervention and at 12-month FU, we found a significant increase in continuously measured BMI for the participants who were underweight and significant improvements in disordered eating attitudes and behaviors (eg, restrained eating as well as weight and shape concerns). At all time points, the rates of new-onset eating disorder cases were (nonsignificantly) lower in the IG than in the CG and the reductions in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition-based eating disorder syndromes were (nonsignificantly) higher in the IG than in the CG. CONCLUSIONS: SB-AN is the first preventive intervention shown to significantly reduce specific risk factors for, and symptoms of, AN and shows promise for reducing full-syndrome AN onset.

How social rejection expectations and depressive symptoms bi-directionally predict each other - A cross-lagged panel analysis,"Kirchner, L.; Schummer, S. E.; Krug, H.; Kube, T.; Rief, W.","BACKGROUND: Although research suggests that social rejection expectations play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms, it is not clear whether such expectations are a risk factor for depression or rather a consequence thereof. The present study addressed this issue by investigating the time-lagged bi-directional effects of social rejection expectations and depressive symptoms. METHODS: In an online survey, participants (N = 347) completed measures of social rejection expectations, depressive symptoms, interpersonal competencies, and perceived social support at baseline and 2 months later. The relationships between the variables were examined using path models and cross-lagged path analyses. RESULTS: Cross-lagged path analyses provided evidence for a substantial positive effect of social rejection expectations at baseline on depressive symptoms at follow-up in addition to the reverse effect. A mediator analysis indicated that neither interpersonal competencies nor perceived social support mediated these bi-directional effects. CONCLUSION: The current results demonstrate that social rejection expectations and depressive symptoms bi-directionally predict each other. Thus, social rejection expectations appears to be both a risk factor for - and a symptom of - depression. In order to prevent a vicious circle of social rejection expectations and depressive symptoms, we recommend the early detection and treatment of social rejection expectations. Moreover, social rejection expectations should be specifically addressed in cognitive-behavioural treatment of depression.",2022,Jun,Psychol Psychother,95,2,477-492,35099102.0,10.1111/papt.12383,,#264,Kirchner 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Prevalence and co-existence of morbidity of posttraumatic stress and functional impairment among Burundian refugee children and their parents,"Scharpf, F.; Kyaruzi, E.; Landolt, M. A.; Hecker, T.","Background: Although the family constitutes the prime source of risk and resilience for the well-being of children growing up in adverse conditions, the mental health of children living in refugee camps has rarely been investigated in conjunction with their parents' mental health. Objectives: To examine the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health problems among Burundian refugee children and their parents living in Tanzanian refugee camps and to identify patterns of comorbidity among children and their parents based on PTSD symptom levels and functional impairment. Methods: We recruited a representative sample of 230 children aged 7-15 years and both of their parents (n = 690) and conducted separate structured clinical interviews. Latent Class Analysis was applied to identify patterns of comorbidity. Results: Children and parents were exposed to multiple traumatic event types. In total, 5.7% of children fulfilled DSM-5 criteria for PTSD in the past month and 10.9% reported enhanced levels of other mental health problems. 42.6% indicated clinically significant functional impairment due to PTSD symptoms. PTSD prevalence was higher among mothers (32.6%) and fathers (29.1%). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) revealed a familial accumulation of PTSD symptoms as children with high symptom levels and impairment were likely to live in families with two traumatized parents. Conclusions: Although the number of children who need support for trauma-related mental health problems was relatively low, taking into account parental trauma could aid to identify at-risk children with elevated PTSD symptom levels and impairment even in the face of existing barriers to mental health care access for children in refugee camp settings (e.g. lack of targeted services, prioritization of managing daily stressors).",2019,2019/10/14,Eur J Psychotraumatol,10,1,1676005,31681466.0,10.1080/20008198.2019.1676005,,#266,Scharpf 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Neural correlates of an attentional bias to health-threatening stimuli in individuals with pathological health anxiety,"Mier, D.; Bailer, J.; Ofer, J.; Kerstner, T.; Zamoscik, V.; Rist, F.; Witthoft, M.; Diener, C.","BACKGROUND: An attentional bias to health-threat stimuli is assumed to represent the primary pathogenetic factor for the development and maintenance of pathological health anxiety (PHA; formerly termed ""hypochondriasis""). However, little is known about the neural basis of this attentional bias in individuals with PHA. METHODS: A group of patients with PHA, a group of depressed patients and a healthy control group completed an emotional Stroop task with health-threat (body symptom and illness) words and neutral control words while undergoing functional MRI. RESULTS: We included 33 patients with PHA, 28 depressed patients and 31 controls in our analyses. As reflected in reaction times, patients with PHA showed a significantly stronger attentional bias to health-threat words than both control groups. In addition, patients with PHA showed increased amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex activation for body symptom, but not for illness words. Moreover, only in patients with PHA amygdala activation in response to symptom words was positively associated with higher arousal and more negative valence ratings of the body symptom word material. LIMITATIONS: A control group of patients with an anxiety disorder but without PHA would have helped to define the specificity of the results for PHA. CONCLUSION: The attentional bias observed in patients with PHA is associated with hyperactivation in response to body symptom words in brain regions that are crucial for an arousal-related fear response (e.g., the amygdala) and for resolving emotional interference (e.g., the rostral anterior cingulate cortex). The findings have important implications for the nosological classification of PHA and suggest the application of innovative exposure-based interventions for the treatment of PHA.",2017,May,J Psychiatry Neurosci,42,3,200-209,28234209.0,10.1503/jpn.160081,,#268,Mier 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Olfaction as a marker for depression in humans,"Croy, I.; Symmank, A.; Schellong, J.; Hummel, C.; Gerber, J.; Joraschky, P.; Hummel, T.","BACKGROUND: Animal studies show a strong link between the loss of olfactory function and depressive behavior. We analyzed, whether olfactory function is a marker for depression in humans. If so, reduced olfactory function can be expected in depression that improves to level of normality after successful antidepressive treatment. METHODS: Twenty-seven female in-patients with depression were compared to 28 healthy age-matched women at the beginning and at the end of antidepressive therapy or at two visits, respectively. Olfactory function was assessed comprehensively including threshold, discrimination and identification testing, chemosensory event related potentials and olfactory functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: At the beginning of psychotherapy the patients exhibited reduced olfactory discrimination, prolonged latencies of the event-related potential and reduced activation in secondary olfactory structures (thalamus, insula, and left middle orbitofrontal). After therapy, patients improved significantly in all of the parameters and consequently the differences between control group and patients vanished.

"Cognitive flexibility, central coherence, and quality of life in anorexia nervosa","Brockmeyer, T.; Febry, H.; Leiteritz-Rausch, A.; Wunsch-Leiteritz, W.; Leiteritz, A.; Friederich, H. C.","BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) has consistently been found to be associated with poor cognitive flexibility and central coherence. These two cognitive functions have been considered important maintenance factors in AN and are addressed by specific treatment approaches such as cognitive remediation therapy. While there is clear empirical evidence that difficulties in such cognitive functions are related to impaired daily functioning in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, this potential association has received only little attention in AN research so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine potential relationships between weak cognitive flexibility, central coherence, and poor quality of life (QoL) in AN. METHODS: Cognitive flexibility and central coherence were measured by both neuropsychological (i.e., performance based) and self-report measures alongside with self-reported QoL in a sample of 138 adult patients with AN. RESULTS: Self-report but not performance based measures of cognitive flexibility and central coherence were associated with QoL. Weaker cognitive flexibility and central coherence were correlated with poorer QoL. These associations were independent of comorbid depression. The link between weak central coherence and poor QoL was particularly strong in patients with the restricting subtype of AN. The link between cognitive flexibility and QoL, however, was independent of AN subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Weak cognitive flexibility and central coherence are associated with low QoL in AN, especially in patients with the restrictive subtype. However, this relationship is dependent on the method of measurement, where self-report measures seem to be more relevant than performance based measures.",2022,Feb 15,J Eat Disord,10,1,22,35168670.0,10.1186/s40337-022-00547-4,,#270,Brockmeyer 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Stages of change, treatment outcome and therapeutic alliance in adult inpatients with chronic anorexia nervosa","Mander, J.; Teufel, M.; Keifenheim, K.; Zipfel, S.; Giel, K. E.","BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with high rates of chronicity and relapse risk is a considerable therapeutic challenge in the disorder. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of stages of change and outcome with a focus on the relapse struggle in the maintenance stage in patients with predominantly chronic AN. Further, therapeutic alliance and stages of change associations were explored. METHODS: As an instrument measuring relapse struggle in the maintenance stage, we applied the short form of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment-Short (URICA-S). We assessed stages of change in 39 patients with a predominantly chronic course of AN in early, middle, and late stages of inpatient psychotherapy. General symptom severity as assessed by the SCL-90-R and weight change were investigated as outcome measures. RESULTS: In-line with earlier evidence, contemplation significantly predicted therapeutic alliance. Further, we demonstrated that relapse risk as operationalized by URICA-S maintenance is an important predictor of general psychopathology. BMI change was not predicted by stages of change. CONCLUSIONS: The URICA-S maintenance scale might be applied to help identify patients at relapse risk. High URICA-S maintenance scores could be considered as one critical aspect of AN patients who might especially benefit from relapse-preventing aftercare programs.",2013,Apr 9,BMC Psychiatry,13,1,111,23570454.0,10.1186/1471-244X-13-111,,#272,Mander 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Defensive Mobilization During Anticipation of Symptom Provocation: Association With Panic Pathology,"Benke, C.; Alius, M. G.; Hamm, A. O.; Pane-Farre, C. A.","BACKGROUND: Anxious apprehension about feared body symptoms is thought to play a crucial role in the development, chronicity, and treatment of panic disorder (PD). In this study, we therefore aimed to elucidate the role of defensive reactivity to anticipated unpleasant symptoms in PD that can contribute to a better understanding of pathomechanisms of PD as well as identification of potential targets in PD-focused interventions. By measuring amygdala-dependent potentiation of the startle reflex, we aimed to investigate whether 1) patients with PD exhibit a specifically increased defensive reactivity to anticipated unpleasant body symptoms and 2) whether clinical severity of panic symptomatology varies with magnitude of defensive activation. METHODS: Defensive mobilization to anticipated threat was investigated in 73 patients with a primary diagnosis of PD with agoraphobia (PDA) and 52 healthy control subjects. Threat of symptom provocation was established by a standardized hyperventilation task and contrasted to threat of shock to the forearm of the participant. RESULTS: Patients with PDA and healthy control subjects did not differ in their defensive responses during anticipation of shock. In contrast, patients with severe PDA as compared with healthy control subjects exhibited increased defensive response mobilization and reported more anxiety and panic symptoms during anticipation of feared body symptoms. Moreover, startle potentiation during anticipation of hyperventilation covaried with the severity of panic symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that increased defensive mobilization during anticipation of body symptoms is a neurobiological correlate of severe PDA that should be specifically targeted in PD interventions and might be used to monitor treatment success.",2023,Apr,Biol Psychiatry Cogn Neurosci Neuroimaging,8,4,397-405,34823048.0,10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.11.005,,#274,Benke 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Transdiagnostic culturally adapted CBT with Farsi-speaking refugees: a pilot study,"Kananian, S.; Ayoughi, S.; Farugie, A.; Hinton, D.; Stangier, U.","Background: Approximately half of all asylum seekers suffer from trauma-related disorders requiring treatment, among them Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. There is a lack of easily accessible, low-threshold treatments taking the cultural background into account. Culturally Adapted CBT (CA CBT) is a well evaluated, transdiagnostic group intervention for refugees, using psychoeducation, meditation, and Yoga-like exercises. Objective: An uncontrolled pilot study with male Farsi-speaking refugees from Afghanistan and Iran was conducted to investigate feasibility with this ethnic group; a group for which no previous CBT trials have been reported. Method: The participants were nine Farsi-speaking, male refugees with M.I.N.I./DSM-IV diagnoses comprising PTSD, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Treatment components were adapted to the specific cultural framework of perception of symptoms, causes, ideas of healing, and local therapeutic processes. Before and after 12 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Secondary outcome measures were the Posttraumatic Checklist, Patient Health Questionnaire, Somatic Symptom Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ), and Emotion Regulation Scale (ERS). Results: Seven participants completed treatment. In the completer analysis, improvements were found on almost all questionnaires. Large effect sizes were seen for the GHQ-28 (d = 2.0), WHOQOL-BREF scales (d = 1.0-2.3), ASQ tolerating subscale (d = 2.2), and ERS (d = 1.7). With respect to feasibility, cultural adaptation seemed to be a crucial means to promote effectiveness. Conclusion: CA CBT may reduce general psychopathological distress and improve quality of life. Improvement in emotion regulation strategies may mediate treatment effects. More support should be provided to enhance coping with the uncertainty of asylum status and stressful housing conditions.

"A pilot study on ecological momentary assessment in asylum-seeking children and adolescents resettled to Germany: Investigating compliance, post-migration factors, and the relation between daily mood, sleep patterns, and mental health","Muller, L. R. F.; Gossmann, K.; Schmid, R. F.; Rosner, R.; Unterhitzenberger, J.","BACKGROUND: Asylum-seeking children and adolescents (ASCs) resettled to western countries show elevated levels of psychological distress. While research on the mental health of ASCs is increasing, less is known about their day-to-day living experiences such as their daily mood, sleep patterns, and post-migration factors. Moreover, no examination in situ, using smartphone-assisted ecological momentary assessment (EMA), has been conducted up to now among ASCs. Furthermore, we do not know if screening measures succeed in reflecting the daily mood of ASCs experienced in everyday life. METHODS: We undertook a smartphone-assisted EMA study over a two-week period with 3 measurements a day. Participants were N = 40 ASCs from 10 different countries who had resettled to Germany. They completed standardized questionnaires screening for history of trauma and clinical symptoms (post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression, and anxiety) that were carried out in interview-like settings, and they participated in the subsequent EMA where they rated mood, sleep parameters, and post-migration factors on a daily basis. Multilevel models of clinical symptoms, daily mood, and sleep parameters were computed based on a total of 680 measurements. RESULTS: The multiply traumatized and highly distressed participants reported different levels of discrimination, and various social activities and contacts in the EMA. The overall compliance rate was shown to be 40.5%. Higher PTSS and anxiety scores were associated with lower levels of daily mood and poorer outcomes of some sleep parameters. Depression scores were not associated with any of the variables assessed in the EMA. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-assisted EMA among ASCs resettled to Germany proved to be implementable despite a rather low compliance rate. Not only do ASCs show high symptom levels, they are also affected by these symptoms in their daily lives. The results emphasize the need for concise screenings and psychological treatment for this high-risk population.

1-year follow-up of the mental health and stress factors in asylum-seeking children and adolescents resettled in Germany,"Muller, L. R. F.; Gossmann, K.; Hartmann, F.; Buter, K. P.; Rosner, R.; Unterhitzenberger, J.","BACKGROUND: Asylum-seeking children and adolescents (ASCs) who have resettled in Western countries show elevated rates of psychological distress, including Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS), depression, and anxiety. Most longitudinal data suggest a relatively stable course of symptoms during the first years in exile. However, no longitudinal examination of the mental health of ASCs, who resettled in Europe in the wake of the 2015-17 European migrant crisis, has been conducted so far. METHODS: A prospective cohort study looked at 98 ASCs who resettled in southern Germany throughout 2015-17. They mainly came from Afghanistan, Syria, Eritrea, and Iraq. Baseline assessments were undertaken 22 months, on average, after resettlement, and follow-up assessments 1 year thereafter. Seventy-two ASCs could be secured for the follow-up. The measures included self-report questionnaires screening for PTSS, depression, anxiety, externalizing behavior, and post-migration factors that were administered in an interview-like setting. Results were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Participating ASCs reported on average eight potentially traumatic experiences and high levels of psychological distress at baseline that had significantly declined at follow-up. At follow-up, rates of clinically significant symptoms ranged from 9.7% (externalizing behavior) to 37.5% (PTSS). There was considerable individual variation in symptom change resulting in multiple mental health trajectories. ASCs whose asylum applications had been rejected presented significantly more symptoms than ASCs whose asylum applications had been accepted between assessments. Baseline psychopathology and asylum status predicted follow-up symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to earlier studies, the symptom severity in this sample of ASCs in Germany ameliorated between assessments. Decisions on the asylum applications of ASCs are thought to contribute to the course of symptoms. Since levels of psychological distress were still high, dissemination and implementation of appropriate treatments for ASCs is crucial.",2019,Jul 8,BMC Public Health,19,1,908,31286909.0,10.1186/s12889-019-7263-6,,#277,Muller 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Evaluation of a short version of the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised questionnaire (ECR-RD8): results from a representative German sample,"Ehrenthal, J. C.; Zimmermann, J.; Brenk-Franz, K.; Dinger, U.; Schauenburg, H.; Brahler, E.; Strauss, B.","BACKGROUND: Attachment insecurity is a prominent risk factor for the development and course of psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders. The Experiences in Close Relationships - Revised (ECR-R) questionnaire is a widely used self-report to assess attachment related anxiety and avoidance. However, its length has the potential to restrict its use in large, multi-instrument studies. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a brief version of the ECR-R, and provide norm values for the German population. METHODS: A screening version of the original ECR-R was developed through principal components analysis of datasets from several previous studies. In a representative sample of 2428 randomly selected individuals from the German population, we compared fit indices of different models by means of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). We investigated the convergent validity of the screening version in an independent convenience sample of 557 participants. Correlations between the short and the full scale were investigated in a re-analysis of the original German ECR-R evaluation sample. RESULTS: CFA indicated a satisfactory model fit for an eight-item version (ECR-RD8). The ECR-RD8 demonstrated adequate reliability. The subscales correlated as expected with another self-report measure of attachment in an independent sample. Individuals with higher levels of attachment anxiety, but especially higher levels of attachment avoidance were significantly more likely to not be in a relationship, across all age groups. Correlations between the short and the full scale were high. CONCLUSIONS: The ECR-RD8 appears to be a reliable, valid, and economic questionnaire for assessing attachment insecurity.

Attentional Bias Temporal Dynamics Predict Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms: A Prospective-Longitudinal Study among Soldiers,"Schafer, J.; Bernstein, A.; Zvielli, A.; Hofler, M.; Wittchen, H. U.; Schonfeld, S.","BACKGROUND: Attentional bias (AB) to threat is thought to play a key role in the development and maintenance of posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTS). Empirical evidence though is inconsistent. Some studies report associations between AB towards, threat and PTS; other studies report associations between AB away from threat and PTS; yet other studies fail to find any association. We propose that prospective-longitudinal study of AB as a dynamic process, expressed from moment to moment in time, may help to understand these mixed findings and the role of AB in PTS. METHODS: We tested cross-sectional and prospective-longitudinal associations between AB and PTS among German soldiers from pre- to post-deployment in Afghanistan (n = 144). AB to threat and positive emotion stimuli (angry/happy faces) was measured using the dot-probe task. PTS was assessed by the PTSD Checklist. The number of traumatic experiences was assessed using CIDI-traumatic experience lists for military. RESULTS: We found that AB dynamics (i.e., towards, away, temporal variability) at pre- and post-deployment, with respect to angry and happy faces, predicted higher levels of PTS after deployment as a function of number of intermediate traumatic experiences. Traditional aggregated mean bias scores did not similarly prospectively predict PTS post deployment. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that AB to emotionally arousing stimuli may play an important function in the development and maintenance of PTS. We argue that mixed and null findings appear to be due to failure to model the within-subject temporal variability in AB expression.

Attentional avoidance in peer victimized individuals with and without psychiatric disorders,"Iffland, B.; Weitkamper, A.; Weitkamper, N. J.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND: Attentional biases are a relatively robust phenomenon among clinical populations but less pronounced in healthy participants. However, regarding the components of attentional biases and the directions of attention allocation, there are several inconsistencies in the literature. The present study examined whether these inconsistencies can be traced back to previous experiences of relational peer victimization in clinical populations. METHODS: Participants were subjects with a diagnosed psychiatric disorder (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 31). Additionally, the sample was divided into two subgroups according to the participants' reports of previous relational peer victimization (high peer victimization: n = 28; low peer victimization: n = 33). Attentional biases were measured by the Emotional Stroop task and a dot-probe task. RESULTS: In both samples, peer victimized participants showed delayed response times when color-naming negative and positive compared to neutral adjectives in the Emotional Stroop task. Likewise, the dot-probe task indicated attentional avoidance of both negative and positive words in peer victimized participants with and without a psychiatric disorder. Interestingly, presence of a psychiatric disorder did not have a significant effect on attentional biases. CONCLUSION: Both tasks could detect that attentional processes were linked to the experience of peer victimization rather than to the current diagnostic status of the participants. Attentional avoidance of emotional stimuli may prevent victimized individuals from responding adequately to environmental stimuli, which may increase the risk for the development of psychopathology.",2019,Feb 22,BMC Psychol,7,1,12,30795803.0,10.1186/s40359-019-0284-1,,#280,Iffland 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to promote face processing and modulate brain activity in healthy adults. The present study examined the effects of oxytocin on the neural basis of face processing in adults with Asperger syndrome (AS). METHODS: A group of 14 individuals with AS and a group of 14 neurotypical control participants performed a face-matching and a house-matching task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The effects of a single dose of 24 IU intranasally administered oxytocin were tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject, cross-over design. RESULTS: Under placebo, the AS group showed decreased activity in the right amygdala, fusiform gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus compared with the control group during face processing. After oxytocin treatment, right amygdala activity to facial stimuli increased in the AS group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that oxytocin increases the saliency of social stimuli and in ASD and suggest that oxytocin might promote face processing and eye contact in individuals with ASD as prerequisites for neurotypical social interaction.",2013,Aug 1,Biol Psychiatry,74,3,164-71,23510581.0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.02.007,,#281,Domes 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Recently, studies have demonstrated that smartphone-based interventions combining CBT with gamified approach-avoidance bias modification training (AAMT) can foster patient engagement and reduce symptoms of several mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: Based on these findings, we developed a gamified smartphone-based intervention, mentalis Phoenix (MT-Phoenix), and hypothesized the program would both engage patients and produce preliminary evidence for the reduction of depressive symptoms. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we evaluated MT-Phoenix in a randomized controlled pilot trial including 77 individuals with elevated depression scores (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores >/=5). Participants were either instructed to train for 14 days with MT-Phoenix or assigned to a waitlist control condition. Engagement with the intervention was measured by assessing usage data. The primary outcome was reduction in depressive symptom severity at postassessment. RESULTS: Data from this pilot trial shows that participants in the intervention group used the smartphone-based intervention for 46% of all days (6.4/14) and reported a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms than did participants in the control condition (F(1,74)=19.34; P=.001), with a large effect size (d=1.02). Effects were sustained at a 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A gamified smartphone-based intervention combining CBT with AAMT may foster patient engagement and effectively target depressive symptoms. Future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in a phase 3 trial using clinical samples. Moreover, the intervention should be compared to active control conditions.

Health anxiety is associated with fearful imagery of contracting COVID-19: An experimental study,"Benke, C.; Schonborn, T.; Habermann, N.; Pane-Farre, C. A.","BACKGROUND: Aversive mental images of contracting or having a severe disease are assumed to contribute to the development and maintenance of health anxiety (HA) via the elicitation of fear, arousal and defensive mobilization. The current COVID-19 pandemic is known to trigger fears of contracting COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we used an experimental approach to investigate whether COVID-19-related mental images lead to a fearful response and whether this is associated with levels of HA. 139 participants vividly imagined neutral, standard fear and COVID-19 related narrative scenes. RESULTS: Standard fear and COVID-19 scripts prompted higher anxiety, arousal, displeasure and avoidance tendencies as compared to neutral scripts. HA was associated with higher anxiety, arousal, displeasure, imagery vividness and stronger avoidance tendencies during imagery of COVID-19 scenes. No associations were found for anxiety sensitivity, trait anxiety as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, there was no association of HA with emotional responses during imagery of standard fear scenes. LIMITATIONS: Fear responses were assessed via verbal reports. Future studies should also assess behavioral and physiological correlates of fear. CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that individuals with high levels of HA are prone to fearful mental imagery of contracting COVID-19 which might be crucial factor contributing to the exacerbation and chronicity of excessive HA in times of a pandemic.",2022,Feb 1,J Affect Disord,298,Pt A,316-321,34763031.0,10.1016/j.jad.2021.11.014,,#286,Benke 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Cognitive emotion regulation in euthymic bipolar disorder,"Wolkenstein, L.; Zwick, J. C.; Hautzinger, M.; Joormann, J.","BACKGROUND: Based on findings indicating increased stress reactivity and prolonged stress recovery in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), it has been proposed that emotion regulation (ER) deficits lie at the core of this disorder. Recent studies show an increased use of maladaptive ER strategies and a decreased use of adaptive ER strategies in BD. Whether this pattern is merely a correlate of affective episodes or might be a stable characteristic of BD, however, remains to be explored. In addition, it is unclear whether these deficits in ER are specific to people with a history of BD. METHODS: We examined whether euthymic BD individuals differ from healthy controls (HC) and individuals with a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with respect to the cognitive ER strategies they habitually use (CERQ) in response to negative affect. The sample consisted of 42 bipolar patients, 43 patients with MDD and 39 HC. RESULTS: Compared to HC, euthymic BD and MDD individuals reported increased use of rumination, catastrophizing, and self-blame alongside decreased use of positive reappraisal, and putting into perspective. No differences were found between BD and MDD groups. LIMITATIONS: These findings are based on self-reports reflecting the habitual use of ER-strategies. The use of more objective methods and the examination of the spontaneous use of ER-strategies in euthymic BD would be desirable. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in the habitual use of ER strategies may characterize BD and MDD individuals even outside of an acute episode and thereby play a role in the recurrence of affective disorders.",2014,May,J Affect Disord,160,,92-7,24445131.0,10.1016/j.jad.2013.12.022,,#287,Wolkenstein 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Behavioral and Magnetoencephalographic Correlates of Fear Generalization Are Associated With Responses to Later Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy in Spider Phobia,"Roesmann, K.; Leehr, E.

J.; Dannlowski, U.; Lueken, U.; Klucken, T.; Hilbert, K.; Straube, T.; Junghofer, M.","BACKGROUND: Because overgeneralization of fear is a pathogenic marker of anxiety disorders, we investigated whether pretreatment levels of fear generalization in spider-phobic patients are related to their response to exposure-based treatment to identify pretreatment moderators of treatment success. METHODS: A total of 90 patients with spider phobia completed pretreatment clinical and magnetoencephalography assessments, one session of virtual reality exposure therapy, and a posttreatment clinical assessment. Based on the primary outcome (30% symptom reduction in self-reported symptoms), they were categorized as responders or nonresponders. In a pretreatment magnetoencephalography fear generalization paradigm involving fear conditioning with 2 unconditioned stimuli (UCS), we obtained fear ratings, UCS expectancy ratings, and event-related fields to conditioned stimuli (CS: CS-, CS+) and 7 different generalization stimuli on a perceptual continuum from CS- to CS+. RESULTS: Before treatment, nonresponders showed behavioral overgeneralization indicated by more linear generalization gradients in fear ratings. Analyses of magnetoencephalography source estimations revealed that nonresponders showed a decline of their (inhibitory) frontal activations to safety-signaling CS- and generalization stimuli compared with CS+ over time, while responders maintained these activations at early (<300 ms) and late processing stages. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide initial evidence that pretreatment differences of behavioral and neural markers of fear generalization may act as moderators of later responses to behavioral exposure. Stimulating further research on fear generalization as a potential predictive marker, our findings are an important first step in the attempt to identify patients who may not benefit from exposure therapy and to personalize and optimize treatment strategies for this vulnerable patient group.",2022,Feb,Biol Psychiatry Cogn Neurosci Neuroimaging,7,2,221-230,34325047.0,10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.07.006,,#288,Roesmann 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for the Prophylaxis of Migraine in Adults: A Three-Armed Randomized Controlled Trial,"Klan, T.; Gaul, C.; Liesering-Latta, E.; Both, B.; Held, I.; Hennemann, S.; Witthoft, M.","BACKGROUND: Behavioral approaches are central to the preventive treatment of migraine but empirical evidence regarding efficacy and effectiveness is still sparse. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed migraine-specific, integrative cognitive-behavioral therapy program (miCBT) combining several approaches (trigger and stress management, coping with fear of attacks, relaxation training) by comparing it with a single behavioral approach (relaxation training, RLX) as an active control group and a waiting-list control group (WLC). METHODS: In a three-armed open-label randomized controlled trial, 121 adults with migraine were assigned to either miCBT, RLX or WLC. The outpatient group therapy (miCBT or RLX) consisted of seven sessions each 90 min. Participants who completed the WLC were subsequently randomized to one of the two treatment groups. Primary outcomes were headache days, headache-related disability, emotional distress, and self-efficacy. The baseline was compared to post-treatment, and followed by assessments 4- and 12-months post-treatment to compare miCBT and RLX. RESULTS: Mixed-model analyses (intention-to-treat sample, 106 participants) showed significantly stronger pre-post improvements in self-efficacy (assessed by the Headache Management Self-Efficacy Scale, HMSE-G-SF) in both treatment groups compared to the WLC (mean difference at post; miCBT: 4.67 [0.55-8.78], p = 0.027; RLX: 4.42 [0.38 to 8.46], p = 0.032), whereas no other significant between-group differences were observed. The follow-up analyses revealed significant within-group improvements from baseline to 12-month follow-up in all four primary outcomes for both treatments. However, between-group effects (miCBT vs. RLX) were not significant at follow-up. CONCLUSION: The miCBT has no better treatment effects compared to RLX in migraine-prophylaxis. Both treatments effectively increase patients' self-efficacy.

Fear of positive evaluation in borderline personality disorder,"Weinbrecht, A.; Roepke, S.; Renneberg, B.","BACKGROUND: Being afraid of others' positive appraisal of oneself is called fear of positive evaluation. Fear of positive evaluation has been studied intensively in the context of social anxiety disorder (SAD). It is not known if individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) fear positive evaluation and which factors are associated with fear of positive evaluation in BPD. METHODS: We applied the fear of positive evaluation scale and further self-report measures (e.g., social phobia inventory, rejection sensitivity questionnaire) to 36 patients with BPD, 29 patients with SAD and 35 healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: A one-way ANOVA revealed that patients with BPD and patients with SAD reported significantly higher fear of positive evaluation than HC. Patients with BPD and SAD did not differ in their fear of positive evaluation. A hierarchical regression analysis revealed an association between rejection sensitivity and fear of positive evaluation in the BPD sample. However, this association disappeared when controlling for social anxiety. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that individuals with BPD fear positive evaluation as much as individuals with SAD do, which has implications for clinical practice. Our results further imply that social anxiety is decisive for high fear of positive evaluation in patients with SAD and patients with BPD.",2020,2020/08/20,PLOS ONE,15,8,e0237944,32817666.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0237944,,#290,Weinbrecht 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Assessment of grief-related rumination: validation of the German version of the Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS),"Doering, B. K.; Barke, A.; Friehs, T.; Eisma, M. C.","BACKGROUND: Bereavement can result in severe mental health problems, including persistent, severe and disabling grief symptoms, termed complicated grief. Grief rumination (i.e., repetitive thought about the causes and consequences of the loss) is a malleable cognitive risk-factor in adjustment to bereavement. The Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS) was recently developed to assess grief rumination. The present study aimed to develop and validate a German version of the UGRS. METHODS: An online survey including measures of demographic and loss-related variables, grief rumination (UGRS), depressive rumination (brooding and reflection), and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and complicated grief, was administered online among 159 persons (87% women) who had lost a first-degree relative in the past three years. UGRS item analyses, a confirmatory factor analysis and associations of grief rumination with brooding, reflection and symptom levels were performed. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the UGRS was good. The confirmatory factor analysis obtained a good fit for a model with five correlated grief rumination subscales. The UGRS contributed uniquely to the prediction of complicated grief symptoms even when controlling for symptoms of anxiety and depression, brooding, reflection, and demographic and loss-related variables. Discriminant validity of the UGRS was demonstrated by the fact that higher UGRS scores were found in participants with a higher likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of complicated grief (d > 1.60). CONCLUSION: The translated UGRS showed very good psychometric properties and the correlations with maladaptive ruminative styles and complicated grief symptoms demonstrated the clinical relevance of grief rumination.

Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Postbariatric Surgery Patients With Mental Disorders: A Pilot Study,"Rudolph, A.; Hilbert, A.","BACKGROUND: Binge-eating disorder (BED) and major depressive disorder (MDD) following bariatric surgery are significant predictors for less post-operative weight loss and/or weight regain, however, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) addressing these disorders following surgery has not been investigated so far. OBJECTIVE: This study examined feasibility of a short-term CBT based on evidence-based manuals for BED and MDD that were adapted to patients following bariatric surgery, and investigated its effectiveness in improving weight loss outcome, psychopathology, and psychosocial functioning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an uncontrolled proof-of-concept study, the CBT manual was piloted in N = 7 patients who had undergone roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery at least 6 months before. Weight loss, eating disorder psychopathology, depressive symptoms, and self-esteem were assessed using clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and in a 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: A significant reduction of body weight was found as well as medium to large effects in the improvement of eating disorder psychopathology, depressive symptoms, and self-esteem from pre-treatment to post-treatment were found. Most of those changes remained stable during the 3-month follow-up period. Study retention was 71.4%.

Neural Correlates of Own- and Other-Face Perception in Body Dysmorphic Disorder,"Ritter, V.; Kaufmann, J. M.; Krahmer, F.; Wiese, H.; Stangier, U.; Schweinberger, S. R.","BACKGROUND: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by an excessive preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in one's own appearance. Previous studies provided evidence for deficits in configural and holistic processing in BDD. Preliminary evidence suggests abnormalities at an early stage of visual processing. The present study is the first examining early neurocognitive perception of the own face in BDD by using electroencephalography (EEG). We investigated the face inversion effect, in which inverted (upside-down) faces are disproportionately poorly processed compared to upright faces. This effect reflects a disruption of configural and holistic processing, and in consequence a preponderance of featural face processing. METHODS: We recorded face-sensitive event-related potentials (ERPs) in 16 BDD patients and 16 healthy controls, all unmedicated. Participants viewed upright and inverted (upside-down) images of their own face and an unfamiliar other face, each in two facial emotional expressions (neutral vs. smiling). We calculated the early ERP components P100, N170, P200, N250, and the late positive component (LPC), and compared amplitudes among both groups. RESULTS: In the early P100, no face inversion effects were found in both groups. In the N170, both groups exhibited the common face inversion effects, with significantly larger N170 amplitudes for inverted than upright faces. In the P200, both groups exhibited larger inversion effects to other (relative to own) faces, with larger P200 amplitudes for other upright than inverted faces. In the N250, no significant group differences were found in face processing. In the LPC, both groups exhibited larger inversion effects to other (relative to own) faces, with larger LPC amplitudes for other inverted than upright faces. These overall patterns appeared to be comparable for both groups. Smaller inversion effects to own (relative to other) faces were observed in none of these components in BDD, relative to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest no evidence for abnormalities at all levels of early face processing in our observed sample of BDD patients.

"Trait-Based Emotional Intelligence, Body Image Dissatisfaction, and HRQoL in Children","Pollatos, O.; Georgiou, E.; Kobel, S.; Schreiber, A.; Dreyhaupt, J.; Steinacker, J. M.","BACKGROUND: Body image dissatisfaction (BID) is related to an increased risk for various health issues including descreased health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the development of problematic eating behaviors and obesity. Previous research indicates that emotional intelligence is one important factor related to BID in adults. Whether this is the case in children, remains yet unknown. Taking this into consideration, the aim of this study was to explore the relationship between BID and trait-based emotion intelligence (TEI) as well as HRQoL in female and male primary school children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TEI and BID were assessed via self-reports as well as HRQoL via parental reports in a large sample of 991 primary school children (429 girls) within the ""Baden Wurttemberg Study"", which evaluated the effectiveness of the health prevention programm ""Join the Healthy Boat"" in Southwestern Germany. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated the interrelation between higher levels of TEI and lower levels of BID among girls and boys. Positive associations were found between better HRQoL, better intrapersonal and stress management abilites (subscales of TEI) and lower BID, as reflected by parental and self-reports. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal an interconnectivity between TEI, BID, and better HRQoL in female and male primary school children. Although the observed correlations were rather small, they nervertheless support the idea that TEI consists a key-factor for the self-regulation of health-related behavior. Prevention programs could benefit from including processes, that sough to improve aspects of emotional intelligence such as intrapersonal, interpersonal abilities, and adaptability, as an effort of preventing problematic habits or lifestyles that could lead to disordered eating behaviors as well as to obesity in middle childhood.",2019,2020/01/23,Front Psychiatry,10,,973,32038322.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00973,,#295,Pollatos 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Enhanced detection of emotional facial expressions in borderline personality disorder,"Schulze, L.; Domes, G.; Koppen, D.; Herpertz, S. C.","BACKGROUND: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is commonly proposed to be characterized by an enhanced sensitivity for emotional stimuli. In the present study, we investigated whether BPD patients show a superior detection of emotional facial expressions relative to healthy controls. The detection of emotional information in the environment represents an important facet of emotional sensitivity. SAMPLING AND METHODS: Twenty patients with BPD were compared with 25 healthy controls. The participants were presented a rapid, continuous stream of neutral and randomly inserted emotional facial expressions and were asked to report the presentation of an emotional facial stimulus after each trial. Availability of cognitive resources was manipulated via two different task demands. RESULTS: The participants with BPD performed significantly better in the detection of positive and negative facial expressions compared to the healthy controls. False alarm rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The BPD participants showed an enhanced detection of emotional expressions that might be related to the emotional disturbances they experience.

Motivational processes in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: results from the Motivational Reserve in Alzheimer's (MoReA) study,"Forstmeier, S.; Maercker, A.","BACKGROUND: Brain reserve, i.e., the ability of the brain to tolerate age- and disease-related changes in a way that cognitive function is still maintained, is assumed to be based on the lifelong training of various abilities. The Motivational Reserve in Alzheimer's (MoReA) is a longitudinal study that aims to examine motivational processes as a protective factor in mild Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This paper presents the results of motivational variables, frequency of diagnoses, and prediction of global cognition as well as depression in a one-year longitudinal study. METHODS: The sample consists of 64 subjects with MCI and 47 subjects with mild AD at baseline. At baseline, the physical/neurological examinations, standard clinical assessment, neuropsychological testing, and assessment of motivational variables were performed. At follow-up (FU) one year later, neuropsychological testing including cognition, functional abilities, behavioral and affective symptoms, and global clinical assessments of severity have been repeated. RESULTS: AD cases have lower motivational capacities as measured with a midlife motivation-related occupational score and informant-reported present motivational processes, but do not differ with regard to delay of gratification (DoG) and self-reported motivational processes. DoG and delay discounting (DD) were relatively stable during the measurement interval. However, 20 % of the MCI cases converted to mild AD at FU, and 17 % of the mild AD cases converted to moderate AD. The rate of depression of Alzheimer's disease was 9 at baseline and 21 % at FU, and the rate of apathy was 7 and 14 %, respectively. Global cognition at FU was mainly predicted by baseline global cognition but also by one of the motivational variables (scenario test). Depression at FU was predicted mainly by two motivational variables (self-reported and informant-reported motivational processes).

This study investigates the role of therapists in initiating and/or consolidating SGs. METHODS: The analyses are based on a sample of patients (N = 1937) who were seen by 155 therapists and received individual psychotherapy at a university outpatient clinic. First, the therapist effect (TE) on SG was investigated using multilevel modeling (MLM). Second, MLM was used to explore the relative importance of patient and therapist variability in SGs as they relate to outcome. RESULTS: The TE on SGs accounted for 1.8% of variance, meaning that therapists are accountable for inter-individual differences in their patients' likelihood to experience SGs. Furthermore, results revealed a significant effect of SGs on outcome for both levels, while therapist differences regarding the consolidation of SGs were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses indicated that some therapists are better in facilitating and initiating SGs.

Harsh discipline relates to internalizing problems and cognitive functioning: findings from a cross-sectional study with school children in Tanzania,"Hecker, T.; Hermenau, K.; Salmen, C.; Teicher, M.; Elbert, T.","BACKGROUND: Child maltreatment poses a risk to children and adolescents' mental health and may also affect cognitive functioning. Also harsh discipline has been frequently associated with mental health problems. However, within societies in which harsh disciplinary methods are culturally normed and highly prevalent less is known about the association between harsh punishment, mental health problems, and cognitive functioning. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we conducted structured clinical interviews with a sample of Tanzanian primary school students assessing exposure to harsh discipline (Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure), internalizing problems (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, Children's Depression Inventory), and working memory (Corsi Blocktapping Task). School performance was measured by using the exam grades in 4 core subjects. The 409 children (52% boys) had a mean age of 10.5 years (range: 6 - 15). RESULTS: Using structural equation modeling, a strong relationship was found between harsh discipline and internalizing problems (beta = .47), which were related to lower working memory capacity (beta = -.17) and school performance (beta = -.17). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that harsh discipline is closely linked to children's internalizing mental health problems, which are in turn associated with lower cognitive functioning and school performance. Given the high rates of harsh discipline experienced by children in East African homes and elsewhere, the findings of the present study emphasize the need to inform the population at large about the potentially adverse consequences associated with harsh discipline.",2016,Apr 29,BMC Psychiatry,16,1,118,27129400.0,10.1186/s12888-016-0828-3,,#307,Hecker 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Child maltreatment, peer victimization, and social anxiety in adulthood: a cross-sectional study in a treatment-seeking sample","Bruhl, A.; Kley, H.; Grocholewski, A.; Neuner, F.; Heinrichs, N.","BACKGROUND: Childhood adversities, especially emotional abuse, emotional neglect, and peer victimization are considered to be crucial risk factors for social anxiety disorder (SAD). We investigated whether particular forms of retrospectively recalled childhood adversities are specifically associated with SAD in adulthood or whether we find similar links in other anxiety or depressive disorders. METHODS: Prevalences of adversities assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and a questionnaire of stressful social experiences (FBS) were determined in N = 1091 outpatients. Adversity severities among patients with SAD only (n = 25), specific phobia only (n = 18), and generalized anxiety disorder only (n = 19) were compared. Differences between patients with anxiety disorders only (n = 62) and depressive disorders only (n = 239) as well as between SAD with comorbid depressive disorders (n = 143) and SAD only were tested. RESULTS: None of the adversity types were found to be specifically associated with SAD and severities did not differ among anxiety disorders but patients with depressive disorders reported more severe emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse than patients with anxiety disorders. SAD patients with a comorbid depressive disorder also reported more severe adversities across all types compared to SAD only. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that particular forms of recalled childhood adversities are not specifically associated with SAD in adulthood.

A.","BACKGROUND: Childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with childhood and adult obesity, and stimulant use with delayed childhood growth, but the independent influences are unclear. No longitudinal studies have examined associations of ADHD diagnosis and stimulant use on BMI trajectories throughout childhood and adolescence. METHODS: We used longitudinal electronic health record data from the Geisinger Health System on 163,820 children ages 3 to 18 years in Pennsylvania. Random effects linear regression models were used to model BMI trajectories with increasing age in relation to ADHD diagnosis, age at first stimulant use, and stimulant use duration, while controlling for confounding variables. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age at first BMI was 8.9 (5.0) years, and children provided a mean (SD) of 3.2 (2.4) annual BMI measurements. On average, BMI trajectories showed a curvilinear relation with age. There were consistent associations of unmedicated ADHD with higher BMIs during childhood compared with those without ADHD or stimulants. Younger age at first stimulant use and longer duration of stimulant use were each associated with slower BMI growth earlier in childhood but a more rapid rebound to higher BMIs in late adolescence. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first longitudinal evidence that ADHD during childhood not treated with stimulants was associated with higher childhood BMIs. In contrast, ADHD treated with stimulants was associated with slower early BMI growth but a rebound later in adolescence to levels above children without a history of ADHD or stimulant use.

T.","BACKGROUND: Childhood maltreatment (CM) compromises resilience against stress and trauma throughout life. Therefore, it could present a major risk factor for the health of frequently trauma-exposed professionals such as emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. OBJECTIVE: We investigated, whether EMS personnel's history of CM increased their risk for mental and physical stress symptoms after occupational trauma exposure. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data from 103 German EMS personnel (age: Mdn+/-QD = 26.00 +/- 8.50 years) were collected as part of a cross-sectional survey distributed among employees of the regional German Red Cross EMS division (response rate 46.6%). The sample corresponded well to the division's entire staff in terms of socio-anagraphic characteristics. METHODS: CM and occupational trauma exposure as well as posttraumatic, depressive, and somatic symptoms were assessed with self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Moderation analyses indicated stronger positive associations between occupational trauma exposure and the severity of posttraumatic (beta = .30, p < .001), depressive (beta = .20, p = .026), and somatic symptoms (beta = .18, p = .059) among EMS personnel who reported a higher exposure to CM. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides initial evidence that CM could increase the EMS personnel's vulnerability to the detrimental consequences of critical incidents on duty. Future research is needed (i) to replicate and generalize our observation on various trauma-exposed professions as well as (ii) to develop preventive measures for targeting the mediating and protective factors which influence the relationship between CM and the negative consequences of occupational trauma exposure.",2020,Jan,Child Abuse Negl,99,,104248,31731138.0,10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.104248,,#310,Behnke 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Social support and hippocampal volume are negatively associated in adults with previous experience of childhood maltreatment,"Forster, K.; Danzer, L.; Redlich, R.; Opel, N.; Grotegerd, D.; Leehr, E.

In this study, we investigated how social support is associated with hippocampal volume in healthy people with previous experience of childhood maltreatment. METHODS: We separated a sample of 446 healthy participants into 2 groups using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire: 265 people without maltreatment and 181 people with maltreatment. We measured perceived social support using a short version of the Social Support Questionnaire. We examined hippocampal volume using automated segmentation (Freesurfer). We conducted a social support x group analysis of covariance on hippocampal volumes controlling for age, sex, total intracranial volume, site and verbal intelligence. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed significantly lower left hippocampal volume in people with maltreatment (left F1,432 = 5.686, p = 0.018; right F1,433 = 3.371, p = 0.07), but no main effect of social support emerged. However, we did find a significant social support x group interaction for left hippocampal volume (left F1,432 = 5.712, p = 0.017; right F1,433 = 3.480, p = 0.06). In people without maltreatment, we observed a trend toward a positive association between social support and hippocampal volume. In contrast, social support was negatively associated with hippocampal volume in people with maltreatment. LIMITATIONS: Because of the correlative nature of our study, we could not infer causal relationships between social support, maltreatment and hippocampal volume. CONCLUSION: Our results point to a complex dynamic between environmental risk, protective factors and brain structure - in line with previous evidence - suggesting a detrimental effect of maltreatment on hippocampal development.",2021,Apr 27,J Psychiatry Neurosci,46,3,E328-E336,33904668.0,10.1503/jpn.200162,,#311,Forster 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The effect of oxytocin on attention to angry and happy faces in chronic depression,"Domes, G.; Normann, C.; Heinrichs, M.","BACKGROUND: Chronic depression is characterized by a high degree of early life trauma, psychosocial impairment, and deficits in social cognition. Undisturbed recognition and processing of facial emotions are basic prerequisites for smooth social interactions. Intranasal application of the neuropeptide oxytocin has been reported to enhance emotion recognition in neuropsychiatric disorders and healthy individuals. We therefore investigated whether oxytocin modulates attention to emotional faces in patients with chronic depression. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, controlled study, 43 patients received a single dose of oxytocin or placebo nasal spray and were tested while fulfilling a facial dot probe task. We assessed reaction times to neutral probes presented at the location of one of two faces depicting happy, angry, or neutral expressions as a prime. RESULTS: When comparing reaction times to the congruent (prime and probe at the same location) with incongruent presentation of facial emotions, neither the placebo nor oxytocin group showed an attentional preference for emotional facial expressions in terms of a threat bias. However, oxytocin treatment did reveal two specific effects: it generally reduced the allocation of attention towards angry facial expressions, and it increased sustained attention towards happy faces, specifically under conditions of heightened awareness, i.e. trials with longer primes. CONCLUSIONS: We investigated a heterogeneous group of medicated male and female patients. We conclude that oxytocin does modulate basic factors of facial emotion processing in chronic depression. Our findings encourage further investigations assessing the therapeutic potential of oxytocin in chronic depression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EUDRA-CT 2010-020956-69 .

Implicit and explicit reward learning in chronic nicotine use,"Paelecke-Habermann, Y.; Paelecke, M.; Giegerich, K.; Reschke, K.; Kubler, A.","BACKGROUND: Chronic tobacco use is related to specific neurobiological alterations in the dopaminergic brain reward system that can be termed ""reward deficiency syndrome"" in dependent nicotine consumers. The close linkage of dopaminergic activity and reward learning led us to expect implicit and explicit reward learning deficits in dependent compared to non-smokers. Smokers who maintain a less regular, occasional use may also, to a lesser extent, show implicit reward learning deficits. The purpose of our study was to examine the behavioral effects of the neurobiological alterations on reward related learning. We also tested whether any deficits observed in an abstinent state are also present in a satiated state. METHODS: In two studies, we examined implicit and explicit reward learning in smokers. Participants were administered a probabilistic implicit reward learning task, and an explicit reward- and punishment-based trial-and-error learning task. In Study 1, we compared dependent, occasional, and non-smokers, and in Study 2 satiated and abstinent smokers. RESULTS: In Study 1, chronic and occasional smokers showed impairments in both, implicit and explicit reward learning tasks. In Study 2, satiated smokers did not perform better than abstinent smokers. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis of reward learning deficits. These deficits are not limited to explicit but extend to implicit reward learning and cannot be explained by tobacco withdrawal.",2013,Apr 1,Drug Alcohol Depend,129,1-2,8-17,23098679.0,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.09.004,,#316,Paelecke-Habermann 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Determination of psychosocial factors in cluster headache - construction and psychometric properties of the Cluster Headache Scales (CHS),"Klan, T.; Brascher, A. K.; Vales, A.; Liesering-Latta, E.; Witthoft, M.; Gaul, C.","BACKGROUND: Cluster headache (CH) is clinically associated with considerable psychosocial burden. However, instruments to assess and characterize psychosocial factors in cluster headache more specifically are lacking. This study aimed to develop a self-report questionnaire, which assesses the broadest possible spectrum of psychosocial factors in cluster headache, the Cluster Headache Scales (CHS). METHOD: Items of the Cluster Headache Scales were constructed based on a literature review and semi-structured interviews with several experts (including persons with cluster headache). A cross-sectional online survey was conducted to determine the psychometric properties and the factor structure of the Cluster Headache Scales. Data was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis as well as exploratory structural equation modelling (ESEM). RESULTS: In total, n = 342 subjects with cluster headache (mean age 47.8, 63% male, 51% with episodic cluster headache) were included. Factor analysis yielded eight clearly interpretable factors: Medical care, medication side effects, fear of attacks, disability, (auto)aggression, coping, physical activity, and financial burden, which are assessed via 36 items. The internal consistencies of the subscales were acceptable to excellent and ranged between Cronbach's alpha = .76 and .93. The pattern of correlations with related instruments provides first evidence for convergent validity. CONCLUSION: The CHS represents a reliable and valid self-report instrument for the assessment of psychosocial factors in persons with cluster headache, which appears useful for both clinical practice as well as research.Trial registration: The study was registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (www.drks.de, ID-Number: DRKS00016502).",2020,Oct,Cephalalgia,40,11,1240-1249,32484060.0,10.1177/0333102420928076,,#318,Klan 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Long-Term Stability of Benefits of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Depends on Symptom Remission During Treatment,"Elsner, B.; Wolfsberger, F.; Srp, J.; Windsheimer, A.; Becker, L.; Jacobi, T.; Kathmann, N.; Reuter, B.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and may afford stable long-term improvements. It is not clear, however, how stability or symptom recurrence can be predicted at the time of termination of CBT. METHOD: In a 1-year follow-up intention-to-treat study with 120 OCD patients receiving individual CBT at a university outpatient unit, we investigated the predictive value of international consensus criteria for response only (Y-BOCS score reduction by at least 35%) and remission status (Y-BOCS score </= 12). Secondly, we applied receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves in order to find an optimal cut-off score to classify for deterioration and for sustained gains. RESULTS: Response only at post-treatment increased the likelihood of deterioration at follow-up compared to remission at an odds ratio of 8.8. Moreover, ROC curves indicated that a post-treatment score of >/= 13 differentiated optimally between patients with and without symptom deterioration at follow-up assessment. The optimal cut-off score to classify for any sustained gains (response, remission, or both) at follow-up relative to baseline was 12. Importantly, previous findings of generally high long-term symptom stability after treatment in OCD could be replicated. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the clinical importance of reaching remission during CBT, and suggest that a recently published expert consensus for defining remission has high utility.",2020,Mar,Clin Psychol Eur,2,1,e2785,36397977.0,10.32872/cpe.v2i1.2785,,#320,Elsner 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Effect of a single dialysis session on cognitive function in CKD5D patients: a prospective clinical study,"Schneider, S. M.; Malecki, A. K.; Muller, K.; Schonfeld, R.; Girndt, M.; Mohr, P.; Hiss, M.; Kielstein, H.; Jager, K.; Kielstein, J. T.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive function declines in parallel to the decrease in glomerular filtration rate, best epitomized by the markedly reduced cerebral performance in patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis [chronic kidney disease stage 5 dialysis (CKD5D)]. Aside from structural permanent damage, there seems to be a reversible part of low cognitive performance. The potential effect of a single dialysis session on cognitive function remains still elusive. The aim of the study was to assess cognitive function using a widespread test battery and avoiding excluding effects of circadian variations. METHODS: Twenty-eight medically stable CKD5D patients (age: 54.9 +/- 13.2 years, dialysis vintage: 46.2 +/- 51.0 month) at two tertiary care centres with outpatient dialysis units were enrolled. Cognitive testing was always performed twice within 24 h, 1 h prior to haemodialysis (T1pre-dialysis) as well as 19 h after the end of dialysis (T2post-dialysis) including assessment of memory, attention and concentration, executive functioning, word fluency and psychomotor speed by using a well-validated neuropsychological test battery. Patients were randomized into two groups. One group was examined before (T1pre-dialysis) and after (T2post-dialysis) Dialysis Session 1. The other group was first examined the day after Dialysis Session 1 (T2post-dialysis) and then before Dialysis Session 2 (T1pre-dialysis) in order to exclude potential learning effects. Twenty age-matched subjects with normal excretory renal function were used for comparison. RESULTS: Neuropsychological testing found that the CKD5D performed significantly worse on measures of alertness, attention, working memory, logical and visual memory, word fluency and executive functions compared with non-CKD subjects. No differences in short-term memory, selective attention, as well as problem-solving and planning were found between CKD5D patients and non-CKD subjects. A single haemodialysis session led to a significant improvement in logical (Rivermead Behaviour Memory Test story: P < 0.001) and visual memories [Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT) memory quotient: P < 0.001], psychomotor speed [Trail Making Test (TMT) B: P = 0.020], activity planning (executive functions) (RCFT copy/points deduction: P < 0.001) and concentration (TMT A: P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate improvements in memory functions, executive functions and psychomotor abilities after a single dialysis session, pointing to a reversible component of low cognitive performance in CKD5D.",2015,Sep,Nephrol Dial Transplant,30,9,1551-9,26071228.0,10.1093/ndt/gfv213,,#322,Schneider 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
No Evidence for the Involvement of Cognitive Immunisation in Updating Beliefs About the Self in Three Non-Clinical Samples,"Kube, T.; Glombiewski, J. A.","BACKGROUND: Cognitive immunisation against disconfirmatory evidence (i.e., devaluing expectation-disconfirming information through cognitive mechanisms) has recently been discussed as an obstacle to the revision of dysfunctional beliefs in mental disorders such as depression. Yet, it is unclear whether cognitive immunisation is also involved in belief updating in non-clinical samples. METHODS: Using a three-group modulation protocol (promotion vs. inhibition of cognitive immunisation vs. control group), we examined how cognitive immunisation influences belief updating in response to performance feedback in three non-clinical samples. In Experiments 1 (N = 99) and 2 (N = 93), participants received unexpectedly negative feedback, whereas participants from Experiment 3 (N = 118) received unexpectedly positive feedback. Depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism were examined as additional predictors of belief updating. RESULTS: In all experiments, participants adjusted their expectations in line with the feedback received, but this effect was not influenced by the cognitive immunisation manipulation. In Experiment 3, expectation change remained stable over 2 weeks. Depressive symptoms were associated with a reduced integration of positive feedback, but not with an increased sensitivity to negative feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas previous research has shown that cognitive immunisation contributes to persistent beliefs in clinical populations, the present findings suggest that it does not affect belief updating in non-clinical samples.

Communicating the diagnosis of cancer or depression: Results of a randomized controlled online study using video vignettes,"Kuhne, F.; Fauth, H.; Ay-Bryson, D. S.; Visser, L. N. C.; Weck, F.","BACKGROUND: Communicating a diagnosis is highly important, yet complex, especially in the context of cancer and mental disorders. The aim was to explore the communication style of an oncologist vs. psychotherapist in an online study. METHODS: Patients (N = 136: 65 cancer, 71 depression) were randomly assigned to watch a standardized video vignette with one of two communication styles (empathic vs. unempathic). Outcome measures of affectivity, information recall, communication skills, empathy and trust were applied. RESULTS: Regardless of diagnosis, empathic communication was associated with the perception of a significantly more empathic (p < 0.001, etapartial2 = 0.08) and trustworthy practitioner (p = 0.014, etapartial2 = 0.04) with better communication skills (p = 0.013, etapartial2 = 0.05). Cancer patients reported a larger decrease in positive affect (p < 0.001, etapartial2 = 0.15) and a larger increase in negative affect (p < 0.001, etapartial2 = 0.14) from pre- to post-video than depressive patients. Highly relevant information was recalled better in both groups (p < 0.001, d = 0.61-1.06).

Unraveling the comorbidity of depression and anxiety in a large inpatient sample: Network analysis to examine bridge symptoms,"Kaiser, T.; Herzog, P.; Voderholzer, U.; Brakemeier, E. L.","BACKGROUND: Comorbidities in mental disorders are often understood by assuming a common cause. The network theory of mental disorders offers an alternative to this assumption by understanding comorbidities as mutually reinforced problems. In this study, we used network analysis to examine bridge symptoms between anxiety and depression in a large sample. METHOD: Using data from a sample of patients diagnosed with both depression and an anxiety disorder before and after inpatient treatment (N = 5,614, mean age: 42.24, 63.59% female, average treatment duration: 48.12 days), network models of depression and anxiety symptoms are estimated. Topology, the centrality of nodes, stability, and changes in network structure are analyzed. Symptoms that drive comorbidity are determined by bridge node analysis. As an alternative to network communities based on categorical diagnosis, we performed a community analysis and propose empirically derived symptom subsets. RESULTS: The obtained network models are highly stable. Sad mood and the inability to control worry are the most central. Psychomotor agitation or retardation is the strongest bridge node between anxiety and depression, followed by concentration problems and restlessness. Changes in appetite and suicidality were unique to depression. Community analysis revealed four symptom groups. CONCLUSION: The estimated network structure of depression and anxiety symptoms proves to be highly accurate. Results indicate that some symptoms are considerably more influential than others and that only a small number of predominantly physical symptoms are strong candidates for explaining comorbidity. Future studies should include physiological measures in network models to provide a more accurate understanding.",2021,Mar,Depress Anxiety,38,3,307-317,33465284.0,10.1002/da.23136,,#326,Kaiser 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

METHODS: In study 1, patients with CBSD were interviewed to develop a list of conflict situations, capturing typical shopping-related dilemmas. In study 2, the shopping-related dilemmas from study 1, standardized close-to-everyday moral dilemmas, the Material Values Scale and Pathological Buying Screener were administered to a web-based convenience sample (n = 274). RESULTS: The main effects of a moderated hierarchical regression analysis revealed an association of more ego-oriented shopping-related decisions with both higher materialistic values endorsement and more CBSD symptoms, but not with everyday moral decision-making. However, a more egoistic everyday moral decision making style moderated the effect of CBSD symptoms on ego-oriented shopping related decisions.

PHQ-9 total scores were not significantly different between the paper and the computer delivered versions. There was a significant interaction effect between format and order of administration for the PHQ-9, indicating that the first administration delivered slightly higher scores. LIMITATIONS: In order to reduce the required effort for the participants, we did not ask them to fill out anything but the PHQ-9 once in paper and once in computer version.

Neural correlates of affective empathy and reinforcement learning in boys with conduct problems: fMRI evidence from a gambling task,"Schwenck, C.; Ciaramidaro, A.; Selivanova, M.; Tournay, J.; Freitag, C. M.; Siniatchkin, M.","BACKGROUND: Conduct problems (CP) comprise abnormal behaviors associated with aberrant aspects of affective empathy as well as learning. However, behavioral measures for affective empathy are challenging, and previous results concerning learning in patients with CP are inconsistent. METHODS: Nineteen boys with CP and 24 typically developing (TD) boys aged 11-17 years (M=14.34, SD=1.93) participated in the study. An ultimatum-game was applied in order to elicit the feeling of like or dislike towards the opponent for a subsequent gambling task, which was played by the opponents (OTHER-condition) and by the participants themselves (SELF-condition). Functional MRI data were recorded throughout the experiment. RESULTS: In accordance with the model of insensitivity to punishment, hypo-activation of the left amygdala, left anterior insula, ventral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) was observed as a response to losing in participants with CP during the SELF-condition. Callous-unemotional (CU)-traits correlated negatively with activation of amygdala and right TPJ. During the OTHER-condition, TD participants showed activation in brain areas associated with theory of mind (right TPJ, left IFG), and affect regulation (right DLPFC) rather than areas associated with affective empathy. This pattern was not found in adolescents with CP. Moreover, and independently of individual characteristics of their opponents, adolescents with CP demonstrated reward-associated activation (ventral striatum) observing others win, which was positively correlated with CU-traits. This may be interpreted in line with the theory of reward dominance. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides support for the theory of abnormal learning processing in adolescents with CP which yields implications for further research as well as clinical practice.

Open-Label Placebo Effects on Psychological and Physical Well-Being: A Conceptual Replication Study,"Brascher, A. K.; Ferti, I. E.; Witthoft, M.","BACKGROUND: Contrary to traditional placebos, open-label placebos (OLP) abstain from deception, i.e., participants are openly informed to receive an inert substance. Studies in clinical and healthy samples evidence the efficacy of OLPs. This study aims to conceptually replicate and expand findings of a recent OLP study in healthy participants while implementing a within-subject design and daily instead of retrospective assessments. Additionally, the effect of a brand name on the medicine container is tested and possible predictors of the OLP effects are explored. METHOD: Healthy participants (N = 75) received OLP and no placebo for 5 days each (randomized sequence) and answered daily questionnaires on sleep quality, bodily symptoms, mental well-being, and psychological distress. The medicine container of half the participants had a brand name, the remaining did not. Different personality traits and situational factors were assessed. RESULTS: Mental and physical well-being did not differ between OLP and control phase, i.e., overall, no OLP effect emerged. Contrast analysis indicated that an OLP effect emerged for sleep quality and psychological distress when no brand name was present. Further, an OLP effect emerged in persons with higher expectations for bodily symptoms (r = .23, p = .046) and psychological distress (r = .24, p = .037).

Cultural Adaptation of CBT for Afghan Refugees in Europe: A Retrospective Evaluation,"Kananian, S.; Starck, A.; Stangier, U.","BACKGROUND: Culturally adapted CBT (CA CBT) is a well-evaluated, culture-sensitive intervention for refugees that utilizes psychoeducation, problem solving training, meditation, and stretching exercises. However, there is a lack of standard procedures for adapting psychotherapeutic interventions to a specific cultural context. Our working group adapted CA CBT for Afghan refugees at two different stages, which yielded promising results from a pilot trial and an RCT with a waitlist control group. This article aimed to illustrate the ongoing adaptation process of CA CBT for Afghan refugees over the course of several trials and to highlight potential limitations by evaluating how systematic adaptations were performed. METHOD: The adaptation process of CA CBT was described in detail, including the methods and rationale for changes to the protocol. This process was analyzed according to a new set of proposed reporting criteria. RESULTS: According to the defined target population and based on multiple research strategies, culturally-specific components, such as the rationales for interventions, metaphors, and idioms of distress, were adapted. Relevant surface adaptations were implemented. However, although the steps of our adaptation process corresponded with the reporting criteria, some of the adaptation processes did not follow explicit criteria but resulted from implicit judgments.

The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is associated with altered hemodynamic responses during appetitive conditioning,"Klucken, T.; Wehrum, S.; Schweckendiek, J.; Merz, C. J.; Hennig, J.; Vaitl, D.; Stark, R.","BACKGROUND: Current models suggest that a variation in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) is associated with altered amygdala reactivity not only towards negative but also towards positive stimuli, which has been neglected in the past. This association may possibly convey an elevated vulnerability for psychopathology like abuse, craving, and relapses. Since appetitive conditioning is a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of these psychiatric disorders, the identification of specific factors contributing to interindividual variation is important. METHODS: In the present study (N = 86), an appetitive conditioning paradigm was conducted, in which a neutral stimulus (CS+) was associated with appetitive stimuli, while a second stimulus (CS-) predicted their absence. Subjects were genotyped according to the 5-HTTLPR genotype. RESULTS: As the main result, we report a significant association between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and hemodynamic responses. Individuals with the s-allele displayed elevated conditioned bilateral amygdala activity in contrast to l/l-allele carriers. Further, increased hemodynamic responses in s-allele carriers were also found in the extended emotional network including the orbitofrontal cortex, the thalamus, and the ventral striatum. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate an association of the 5-HTTLPR and altered conditioned responses in appetitive conditioning. Further, the findings contribute to the ongoing debate on 5-HTTLPR dependent hemodynamic response patterns by emphasizing that s-allele carriers are not exclusively biased towards fearful, but also towards positive stimuli. In conclusion, our results imply that s-allele carriers might be better described as hyper-reactive towards salient stimuli, which may convey vulnerability for the development of psychiatric disorders.",2013,Oct,Hum Brain Mapp,34,10,2549-60,22505321.0,10.1002/hbm.22085,,#332,Klucken 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

METHODS: Data was collected via online self-assessment between April 2017 and March 2018. SIRs were operationalized by the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) and illness outcomes according to the CSM were defined as BMI, eating behaviour, physical wellbeing, bodyweight satisfaction, and shape concerns. The sample consisted of 427 adults (M = 42.2 years, SD = 10.9; 82% female) with obesity (BMI: M = 42.3 kg/m(2), SD = 9.0). Student's t-tests and multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with the control variables (age and BMI) and subjective illness representations and gender as independent variables. RESULTS: The explanation of outcome variances was moderate to high (21-43%) except for restraint eating behaviour (10%). Subjective illness representations showed several significant associations with weight-related variables, especially timeline and emotional representations. Female gender was significantly associated with more restraint eating behaviour [F ((1, 400)) = 4.19, p < 0.001] and females had unfavourable values of the weight-related variables as well as a more cyclic [t ((425)) = 3.68, p < 0.001], and more emotional representation [t ((100)) = 5.17, p < 0.001] of their obesity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that gender and subjective illness representations, especially the emotional representation, play an important role for weight-related variables. Therefore, the assessment of SIRs may constitute an economic tool to identify specific individual deficits of self-regulation.",2022,2022/02/08,Front Nutr,9,,799831,35211498.0,10.3389/fnut.2022.799831,,#333,Henning 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Defeat, entrapment, and suicidal ideation: Twelve-month trajectories","Holler, I.; Rath, D.; Teismann, T.; Glaesmer, H.; Lucht, L.; Paashaus, L.; Schonfelder, A.; Juckel, G.; Forkmann, T.","BACKGROUND: Defeat and entrapment have been highlighted in the development of suicidal ideation within the Integrated Motivational-Volitional model of suicidal behavior. Research suggests that entrapment has to be differentiated into internal and external entrapment. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between defeat, internal, external entrapment, and suicidal ideation within and prospectively over measurements. METHODS: A sample of 308 psychiatric inpatients (53% female) aged 18 to 81 years (M = 36.92, SD = 14.30) was assessed for the four constructs after admission to a psychiatric ward and six, nine, and twelve months later. Multilevel analyses were conducted to examine associations. RESULTS: Defeat was associated with (a change in) internal and external entrapment. Defeat predicted a change in internal entrapment over time. Defeat and internal, but not external, entrapment were associated with (a change in) suicidal ideation. Internal entrapment was able to predict suicidal ideation. Internal entrapment and defeat predicted a change in suicidal ideation over time. CONCLUSION: Results highlight the importance to distinguish between internal and external entrapment, and their specific association with suicidal ideation.

Defeat and entrapment: more than meets the eye? Applying network analysis to estimate dimensions of highly correlated constructs,"Forkmann, T.; Teismann, T.; Stenzel, J. S.; Glaesmer, H.; de Beurs, D.","BACKGROUND: Defeat and entrapment have been shown to be of central relevance to the development of different disorders. However, it remains unclear whether they represent two distinct constructs or one overall latent variable. One reason for the unclarity is that traditional factor analytic techniques have trouble estimating the right number of clusters in highly correlated data. In this study, we applied a novel approach based on network analysis that can deal with correlated data to establish whether defeat and entrapment are best thought of as one or multiple constructs. METHODS: Explanatory graph analysis was used to estimate the number of dimensions within the 32 items that make up the defeat and entrapment scales in two samples: an online community sample of 480 participants, and a clinical sample of 147 inpatients admitted to a psychiatric hospital after a suicidal attempt or severe suicidal crisis. Confirmatory Factor analysis (CFA) was used to test whether the proposed structure fits the data. RESULTS: In both samples, bootstrapped exploratory graph analysis suggested that the defeat and entrapment items belonged to different dimensions. Within the entrapment items, two separate dimensions were detected, labelled internal and external entrapment. Defeat appeared to be multifaceted only in the online sample. When comparing the CFA outcomes of the one, two, three and four factor models, the one factor model was preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Defeat and entrapment can be viewed as distinct, yet, highly associated constructs. Thus, although replication is needed, results are in line with theories differentiating between these two constructs.",2018,Jan 25,BMC Med Res Methodol,18,1,16,29370770.0,10.1186/s12874-018-0470-5,,#335,Forkmann 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Challenging control over emotions in borderline personality disorder - a tDCS study,"Wolkenstein, L.; Rombold-Bruehl, F.; Bingmann, T.; Sommer, A.; Kanske, P.; Plewnia, C.","BACKGROUND: Deficient cognitive control (CC) over emotional distraction is a central characteristic of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Reduced activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been linked to this deficit. This study investigates whether it is possible to ameliorate CC deficits via anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC in BPD. Furthermore, we investigate whether the extent of CC impairment influences how well one responds to tDCS. METHODS: The effect of a single-session tDCS (1 mA for 20 min, reference electrode on the contralateral mastoid bone) to the left dlPFC (F3) on the CC of patients with BPD (N = 20) and healthy control participants (HCs, N = 20) was examined in a double-blinded, balanced randomized, sham-controlled crossover trial. A delayed response working memory task with negative, neutral and positive pictures presented during the delay period was conducted to assess CC. Stimulation was applied simultaneously with the task. RESULTS: Negative pictures caused prolonged response times as compared to a control condition in patients with BPD and HCs. Anodal tDCS to the left dlPFC did not significantly reduce this interference effect in the overall sample. Further analyses showed, however, that participants with impaired CC profited the most from anodal tDCS. In the subgroup of participants who actually showed an interference effect we found the expected significant amelioration of CC under tDCS. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that anodal tDCS applied to the left dlPFC improves deficient CC. Thereby, base-level performance moderates tDCS effects. Hence, tDCS might be suitable to support behavioral trainings to enhance CC specifically in people whose impairments in CC are comparably high.",2021,Jun 18,Neuropsychologia,156,,107850,33812945.0,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.107850,,#336,Wolkenstein 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Amelioration of cognitive control in depression by transcranial direct current stimulation,"Wolkenstein, L.; Plewnia, C.","BACKGROUND: Deficient cognitive control over emotional distraction is a central characteristic of major depressive disorder (MDD). Hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been linked with this deficit. In this study, we aimed to enhance the activity of the dlPFC in MDD patients by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and thus ameliorate cognitive control. METHODS: In a double-blinded, balanced, randomized, sham-controlled crossover trial, we determined the effect of a single-session tDCS to the left dlPFC on the cognitive control in 22 MDD patients and 22 healthy control subjects. To assess the cognitive control, we used a delayed response working memory task with pictures of varying content (emotional vs. neutral) presented during the delay period. RESULTS: Emotional pictures presented during the delay period impaired accuracy and response time of patients with MDD, indicating an attentional bias for emotional stimuli. Anodal tDCS to the dlPFC was associated with an enhanced working memory performance both in patients and control subjects. Specifically in subjects with MDD, the attentional bias was completely abolished by anodal tDCS. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that anodal tDCS applied to the left dlPFC improves deficient cognitive control in MDD.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to test whether integrating a systematic emotion regulation training (ERT) enhances the efficacy of routine inpatient cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for MDD. METHODS: In a prospective randomized controlled trial, 432 inpatients meeting criteria for MDD were assigned to receive either routine CBT or CBT enriched with an intense emotion regulation skills training (CBT-ERT). RESULTS: Participants in the CBT-ERT condition demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in depression (response rates - CBT: 75.5%, CBT-ERT: 84.9%; remission rates - CBT: 51.1%, CBT-ERT: 65.1%). Moreover, CBT-ERT participants demonstrated a significantly greater reduction of negative affect, as well as a greater increase of well-being and emotion regulation skills particularly relevant for mental health.

"Pilot testing of an adaptive, individualized inhibitory control training for binge drinking: first evidence on feasibility, acceptance, and efficacy","Reichl, D.; Enewoldsen, N.; Muller, A.; Steins-Loeber, S.","BACKGROUND: Deficits in inhibitory control seem to promote habit behavior and therefore play an important role in the development and maintenance of addictive diseases. Although several training approaches have been suggested, there is a considerable lack of knowledge about the best way to improve inhibitory control. Based on a literature review regarding shortcomings of existing trainings, an individualized, adaptive inhibitory control training was developed. We aimed to assess feasibility and acceptance of this training and to provide preliminary results on its efficacy regarding inhibitory control and binge drinking. METHODS: Sixty-one individuals (30 female) with binge drinking behavior were randomly allocated to either an experimental group receiving three sessions of the inhibitory control training or a waitlist control group receiving no training. Before and after the training, the participants performed a Go/NoGo task to assess inhibitory control (commission errors and false reaction time), completed a questionnaire on drinking-related self-control, and reported drinking behavior. RESULTS: Although the training was feasible and accepted by participants, it did not affect self-control over drinking, inhibitory control or drinking behavior. The relationship between session number and false reaction time was linear for alcohol stimuli, but squared for neutral stimuli. CONCLUSION: Although our findings have to be interpreted in the light of some shortcomings, they demonstrate that further research is needed to enhance our understanding of how to improve inhibitory control and which factors might moderate this process.",2022,Aug 22,Psychol Res,,,1-17,35994096.0,10.1007/s00426-022-01725-4,,#339,Reichl 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Depression and suicidal ideation in high-performance athletes suffering from low back pain: The role of stress and pain-related thought suppression,"Konietzny, K.; Chehadi, O.; Levenig, C.; Kellmann, M.; Kleinert, J.; Mierswa, T.; Hasenbring, M. I.","BACKGROUND: Depression and suicidal ideation are important health problems in athletes suffering from pain. Dysfunctional pain cognitions, that is, pain-related thought suppression (PTS), may play an important role in their aetiology. Thought suppression was shown to increase depressive mood, particularly in highly stressed individuals. This cross-sectional study examines the relationship between PTS and stress on depression and suicidal ideation in athletes with pain. METHODS: A total of 159 athletes with non-specific low back pain completed a set of questionnaires to measure PTS, depression and stress. Participants were split into groups with high and low stress, and high and low PTS. Two-way ANOVA calculated main effects for PTS, stress and a PTS*stress interaction, with depressive symptoms as dependent. Subsequently, distribution tests were calculated, investigating if the presence of clinically relevant depression and suicidal ideation is dependent of conditions of high/low PTS and stress. RESULTS: A main effect of stress demonstrated higher depression scores in highly stressed athletes. Further, a significant PTS*stress interaction showed elevated depression scores in athletes with high PTS and high stress. Distribution analysis revealed positive associations between PTS, stress and depression, with depression being most frequent among athletes with high PTS and high stress. Suicidal ideation was not significantly associated with PTS and only weakly correlated with stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that PTS is the most common pain response in athletes with pain. The results indicate a higher prevalence of depression and elevated depressive symptoms in athletes experiencing high stress, seemingly more pronounced when highly engaging in PTS. SIGNIFICANCE: This study contributes to the understanding of depression in athletes with pain, suggesting stress and pain-related thought suppression to increase symptoms and prevalence of depression. As athletes often experience acute or chronic pain, understanding the impact of pain cognitions on health outcomes is an important step in the optimization of treatments.",2019,Jul,Eur J Pain,23,6,1196-1208,30821880.0,10.1002/ejp.1387,,#341,Konietzny 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Maintaining Outcomes of Internet-Delivered Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Depression: A Network Analysis of Follow-Up Effects,"Kaiser, T.; Boschloo, L.; Berger, T.; Meyer, B.; Spath-Nellissen, C.; Schroder, J.; Hohagen, F.; Moritz, S.; Klein, J. P.","Background: Depression is a highly prevalent mental disorder, but only a fraction of those affected receive evidence-based treatments. Recently, Internet-based interventions were introduced as an efficacious and cost-effective approach. However, even though depression is a heterogenous construct, effects of treatments have mostly been determined using aggregated symptom scores. This carries the risk of concealing important effects and working mechanisms of those treatments. Methods: In this study, we analyze outcome and long-term follow-up data from the EVIDENT study, a large (N = 1,013) randomized-controlled trial comparing an Internet intervention for depression (Deprexis) with care as usual. We use Network Intervention Analysis to examine the symptom-specific effects of the intervention. Using data from intermediary and long-term assessments that have been conducted over 36 months, we intend to reveal how the treatment effects unfold sequentially and are maintained. Results: Item-level analysis showed that scale-level effects can be explained by small item-level effects on most depressive symptoms at all points of assessment. Higher scores on these items at baseline predicted overall symptom reduction throughout the whole assessment period. Network intervention analysis offered insights into potential working mechanisms: while deprexis directly affected certain symptoms of depression (e.g., worthlessness and fatigue) and certain aspects of the quality of life (e.g., overall impairment through emotional problems), other domains were affected indirectly (e.g., depressed mood and concentration as well as activity level). The configuration of direct and indirect effects replicates previous findings from another study examining the same intervention. Conclusions: Internet interventions for depression are not only effective in the short term, but also exert long-term effects. Their effects are likely to affect only a small subset of problems. Patients reporting these problems are likely to benefit more from the intervention. Future studies on online interventions should examine symptom-specific effects as they potentially reveal the potential of treatment tailoring.

Clinical correlates of sex hormones in women: The study of health in Pomerania,"Kische, H.; Gross, S.; Wallaschofski, H.; Volzke, H.; Dorr, M.; Nauck, M.; Haring, R.","BACKGROUND: Despite associations of sex hormones in women with increased cardiometabolic risk and mortality, the clinical correlates of altered sex hormone concentrations in women are less clearly understood. We investigated a broad range of clinical correlates of sex hormones in women from a large population-based sample. METHODS: Data from 2560 women from two cohorts of the Study of Health in Pomerania were used. Stepwise multivariable regression models were implemented to investigate a broad range of behavioral, socio-demographic, and cardiometabolic clinical correlates related to total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (fT), androstenedione (ASD), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). RESULTS: Waist circumference and BMI (beta-coefficient: -0.03; 95% CI: -0.04; 0.03) were inversely related to SHBG, and BMI was positively related to TT (beta-coefficient: 0.005; 95% CI: 0.001; 0.009), fT, E1, and E2. Smoking was positively related to TT (beta-coefficient: 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01; 0.06), ASD, and fT. Systolic blood pressure (TT: beta-coefficient: 0.002; 95% CI: 0.001; 0.003), hypertension (TT: beta-coefficient: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.003; 0.11), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (TT: beta-coefficient: 0.02; 95% CI: 0.01; 0.05), and total cholesterol (TT: beta-coefficient: -0.03; 95% CI: 0.01; 0.05) were positively related to TT and ASD. Finally, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and metabolic syndrome (MetS) were positively related to fT, but inversely related to SHBG. CONCLUSIONS: Our population-based study, with sex hormone concentrations measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, revealed associations between clinical correlates including waist circumference, smoking, cohabitation, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol, and MetS with sex hormones.

"A Single-blinded, Randomized Clinical Trial of How to Implement an Evidence-based Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder [IMPLEMENT]--Effects of Three Different Strategies of Implementation","Fluckiger, C.; Forrer, L.; Schnider, B.; Battig, I.; Bodenmann, G.; Zinbarg, R. E.","BACKGROUND: Despite long-standing calls to disseminate evidence-based treatments for generalized anxiety (GAD), modest progress has been made in the study of how such treatments should be implemented. The primary objective of this study was to test three competing strategies on how to implement a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) for out-patients with GAD (i.e., comparison of one compensation vs. two capitalization models). METHODS: For our three-arm, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (implementation of CBT for GAD [IMPLEMENT]), we recruited adults with GAD using advertisements in high-circulation newspapers to participate in a 14-session cognitive behavioral treatment (Mastery of your Anxiety and Worry, MAW-packet). We randomly assigned eligible patients using a full randomization procedure (1:1:1) to three different conditions of implementation: adherence priming (compensation model), which had a systematized focus on patients' individual GAD symptoms and how to compensate for these symptoms within the MAW-packet, and resource priming and supportive resource priming (capitalization model), which had systematized focuses on patients' strengths and abilities and how these strengths can be capitalized within the same packet. In the intention-to-treat population an outcome composite of primary and secondary symptoms-related self-report questionnaires was analyzed based on a hierarchical linear growth model from intake to 6-month follow-up assessment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02039193) and is closed to new participants. FINDINGS: From June 2012 to Nov. 2014, from 411 participants that were screened, 57 eligible participants were recruited and randomly assigned to three conditions. Forty-nine patients (86%) provided outcome data at post-assessment (14% dropout rate). All three conditions showed a highly significant reduction of symptoms over time. However, compared with the adherence priming condition, both resource priming conditions indicated faster symptom reduction. The observer ratings of a sub-sample of recorded videos (n = 100) showed that the therapists in the resource priming conditions conducted more strength-oriented interventions in comparison with the adherence priming condition. No patients died or attempted suicide. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first trial that focuses on capitalization and compensation models during the implementation of one prescriptive treatment packet for GAD. We have shown that GAD related symptoms were significantly faster reduced by the resource priming conditions, although the limitations of our study included a well-educated population. If replicated, our results suggest that therapists who implement a mental health treatment for GAD might profit from a systematized focus on capitalization models.

Recognizing obsessive-compulsive disorder: how suitable is the German Zohar-Fineberg obsessive-compulsive screen?,"Kuhne, F.; Paunov, T.; Weck, F.","BACKGROUND: Despite the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), its precise identification remains challenging. With the Zohar-Fineberg Obsessive-Compulsive Screen (ZF-OCS; 5 or 6 items), a brief instrument is widely available mainly in English. As there is a lack of empirical studies on the ZF-OCS, the aim of the present study was to translate the items into German and investigate the instrument in a nonclinical sample. METHODS: In two consecutive online surveys, n = 304 and n = 51 students participated. Besides the ZF-OCS, they answered established measures on OCD, depression, health anxiety, general anxiety and health-related well-being. RESULTS: Whereas internal consistency was low (alpha = .53-.72; omega = .55-.69), retest reliability (r(t1,t2) = .89) at two weeks was high. As expected, we found high correlations with other OCD instruments (r > .61; convergent validity), and significantly weaker correlations with measures of depression (r = .39), health anxiety (r = .29), and health-related well-being (r = -.28, divergent validity). Nonetheless, the correlations with general anxiety were somewhere in between (r = .52). CONCLUSIONS: Due to heterogeneous OCD subtypes, the ZF-OCS asks diverse questions which probably resulted in the present internal consistency. Nevertheless, the results on retest reliability and validity were promising. As for other OCD instruments, divergent validity regarding general anxiety seems problematic to establish. Even so, the ZF-OCS seems valuable for screening purposes, as it is short and easy to administer, and may facilitate initiating subsequent clinical assessment. Further studies should determine the instrument's diagnostic accuracy.",2021,Sep 11,BMC Psychiatry,21,1,450,34511062.0,10.1186/s12888-021-03458-x,,#347,Kuhne 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

In the present study, we performed a voxel-based morphometric analysis to provide initial insight into local abnormalities of gray matter (GM) volume. METHODS: Structural brain images were obtained from patients with NPD (n = 17) and a sample of healthy controls (n = 17) matched regarding age, gender, handedness, and intelligence. Groups were compared with regard to global brain tissue volumes and local abnormalities of GM volume. Regions-of-interest analyses were calculated for the anterior insula. RESULTS: Relative to the control group, NPD patients had smaller GM volume in the left anterior insula. Independent of group, GM volume in the left anterior insula was positively related to self-reported emotional empathy. Complementary whole-brain analyses yielded smaller GM volume in fronto-paralimbic brain regions comprising the rostral and median cingulate cortex as well as dorsolateral and medial parts of the prefrontal cortex.

It combines elements of DBT with trauma-focused cognitive behavioural interventions. Objective: To investigate the feasibility, acceptance and safety of DBT-PTSD in an outpatient treatment setting by therapists who were novice to the treatment, we treated 21 female patients suffering from PTSD following childhood sexual abuse (CSA) plus difficulties in emotion regulation in an uncontrolled clinical trial. Method: The Clinician Administered PTSD Symptom Scale (CAPS), the Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS), the Borderline Section of the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE) and the Borderline Symptom List (BSL-23) were used as primary outcomes. For secondary outcomes, depression and dissociation were assessed. Assessments were administered at pretreatment, post-treatment and six-week follow-up. Results: Improvement was significant for PTSD as well as for borderline personality symptomatology, with large pretreatment to follow-up effect sizes for completers based on the CAPS (Cohens d = 1.30), DTS (d = 1.50), IPDE (d = 1.60) and BSL-23 (d = 1.20).

Peer Victimization Influences Attention Processing Beyond the Effects of Childhood Maltreatment by Caregivers,"Iffland, B.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND: Different types of maltreatment (emotional, physical, and sexual) lead to distortions in emotion and attention processing. The present study investigated whether the experience of peer victimization in childhood and adolescence has an additional influence on attention processing in adulthood. METHODS: Two non-clinical samples consisting of individuals with different levels of experiences of maltreatment were recruited. In an evaluative conditioning task, images of faces with neutral emotional expression were either associated with short videos of intense negative statements, or associated with neutral videos. Subsequently, these faces were used as stimuli in an emotional Stroop task as well as a dot-probe task. RESULTS: In both tasks, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that retrospective reports of relational peer victimization made an incremental contribution to the prediction of attentional biases beyond child maltreatment. In the emotional Stroop task, emotional abuse was the strongest predictor for an attentional bias showing delayed responses to negatively associated faces, while peer victimization was associated with faster responses to negatively associated faces. In the dot-probe task, relational peer victimization was the strongest predictor for an attentional bias. When the attentional bias was examined in more detail, though, peer victimization did not show incremental contributions although emotional abuse remained the strongest predictor for facilitated attention toward negatively associated neutral faces. CONCLUSION: Experiences of peer victimization leave additional cognitive scars beyond effects of childhood maltreatment by caregivers. It is likely that attentional biases in the aftermath of victimization put individuals at risk for the development of psychopathology.",2022,2022/03/04,Front Psychol,13,,784147,35310289.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.784147,,#351,Iffland 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Aberrant adapting of beliefs under stress: a mechanism relevant to the formation of paranoia?,"Krkovic, K.; Nowak, U.; Kammerer, M. K.; Bott, A.; Lincoln, T. M.","BACKGROUND: Difficulties in the ability to adapt beliefs in the face of new information are associated with psychosis and its central symptom - paranoia. As cognitive processes and psychotic symptoms are both known to be sensitive to stress, the present study investigated the exact associations between stress, adapting of beliefs [reversal learning (RL), bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), and jumping to conclusions (JTC)] and paranoia. We hypothesized that paranoia would increase under stress and that difficulties in adapting of beliefs would mediate or moderate the link between stress and paranoia. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the investigated effects would be strongest in the group of individuals diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. METHODS: We exposed 155 participants (38 diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, 40 individuals with attenuated psychotic symptoms, 39 clinical controls diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 38 healthy controls) to a control condition and a stress condition, in which we assessed their levels of paranoia and their ability to adapt beliefs. We applied multilevel models to analyze the data. RESULTS: Paranoia was higher in the stress condition than in the control condition, b = 1.142, s.e. = 0.338, t(150) = 3.381, p < 0.001. RL, BADE, and JTC did not differ between conditions and did not mediate or moderate the association between stress and paranoia (all ps > 0.05).

Genetics of preparation and response control in ADHD: the role of DRD4 and DAT1,"Albrecht, B.; Brandeis, D.; Uebel-von Sandersleben, H.; Valko, L.; Heinrich, H.; Xu, X.; Drechsler, R.; Heise, A.; Kuntsi, J.; Muller, U. C.; Asherson, P.; Steinhausen, H. C.; Rothenberger, A.; Banaschewski, T.","BACKGROUND: Difficulties with performance and brain activity related to attentional orienting (Cue-P3), cognitive or response preparation (Cue-CNV) and inhibitory response control (Nogo-P3) during tasks tapping executive functions are familial in ADHD and may represent endophenotypes. The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene polymorphisms on these processes in ADHD and control children. METHODS: Behavioural and electrophysiological parameters from cued continuous performance tests with low and high attentional load were assessed in boys with ADHD combined type (N = 94) and controls without family history of ADHD (N = 31). Both groups were split for the presence of at least one DRD4 7-repeat allele and the DAT1 10-6 haplotype. RESULTS: Children with ADHD showed diminished performance and lower Cue-P3, CNV and Nogo-P3 amplitudes. Children with DRD4 7R showed similar performance problems and lower Cue-P3 and CNV, but Nogo-P3 was not reduced. Children with the DAT1 10-6 haplotype had no difficulties with performance or Cue-P3 and CNV, but contrary to expectations increased Nogo-P3. There were no Genotype by ADHD interactions. CONCLUSIONS: This study detected specific effects of DRD4 7R on performance and brain activity related to attentional orienting and response preparation, while DAT1 10-6 was associated with elevated brain activity related to inhibitory response control, which potentially compensates increased impulsivity. As these genotype effects were additive to the impact of ADHD, the current results indicate that DRD4 and DAT1 polymorphisms are functionally relevant risk factors for ADHD and presumably other disorders sharing these endophenotypes.",2014,Aug,J Child Psychol Psychiatry,55,8,914-23,24521003.0,10.1111/jcpp.12212,,#354,Albrecht 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Diagnostic Performance of an App-Based Symptom Checker in Mental Disorders: Comparative Study in Psychotherapy Outpatients,"Hennemann, S.; Kuhn, S.; Witthoft, M.; Jungmann, S. M.","BACKGROUND: Digital technologies have become a common starting point for health-related information-seeking. Web- or app-based symptom checkers aim to provide rapid and accurate condition suggestions and triage advice but have not yet been investigated for mental disorders in routine health care settings. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the diagnostic performance of a widely available symptom checker in the context of formal diagnosis of mental disorders when compared with therapists' diagnoses based on structured clinical interviews. METHODS: Adult patients from an outpatient psychotherapy clinic used the app-based symptom checker Ada-check your health (ADA; Ada Health GmbH) at intake. Accuracy was assessed as the agreement of the first and 1 of the first 5 condition suggestions of ADA with at least one of the interview-based therapist diagnoses. In addition, sensitivity, specificity, and interrater reliabilities (Gwet first-order agreement coefficient [AC1]) were calculated for the 3 most prevalent disorder categories. Self-reported usability (assessed using the System Usability Scale) and acceptance of ADA (assessed using an adapted feedback questionnaire) were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients (30/49, 61% women; mean age 33.41, SD 12.79 years) were included in this study. Across all patients, the interview-based diagnoses matched ADA's first condition suggestion in 51% (25/49; 95% CI 37.5-64.4) of cases and 1 of the first 5 condition suggestions in 69% (34/49; 95% CI 55.4-80.6) of cases. Within the main disorder categories, the accuracy of ADA's first condition suggestion was 0.82 for somatoform and associated disorders, 0.65 for affective disorders, and 0.53 for anxiety disorders. Interrater reliabilities ranged from low (AC1=0.15 for anxiety disorders) to good (AC1=0.76 for somatoform and associated disorders). The usability of ADA was rated as high in the System Usability Scale (mean 81.51, SD 11.82, score range 0-100). Approximately 71% (35/49) of participants would have preferred a face-to-face over an app-based diagnostic. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that a widely available symptom checker used in the formal diagnosis of mental disorders could provide clinicians with a list of condition suggestions with moderate-to-good accuracy. However, diagnostic performance was heterogeneous between disorder categories and included low interrater reliability. Although symptom checkers have some potential to complement the diagnostic process as a screening tool, the diagnostic performance should be tested in larger samples and in comparison with further diagnostic instruments.",2022,Jan 31,JMIR Ment Health,9,1,e32832,35099395.0,10.2196/32832,,#356,Hennemann 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Out of sight, out of mind? High discrepancy between observer- and patient-reported outcome after routine inpatient treatment for depression","Kaiser, T.; Herzog, P.; Voderholzer, U.; Brakemeier, E. L.","BACKGROUND: Divergent outcomes of treatment for depression occur regularly, but often go undetected by clinical judgment alone. To date, no comprehensive studies are available on what the detection rate of divergent outcomes is in routine care. METHOD: We analyzed a large (N = 20,882) database of clinician-rated and patient-reported outcomes from routine inpatient treatment for depression. RESULTS: There was little agreement (57.7% on the GAF, 7.8% on the CGI-I) between clinician ratings and patients not showing clinically significant change. There was virtually no agreement (0.6% on the GAF, 2% on the CGI-I) between clinician ratings and self-report scales in deteriorated patients. Multiple regression showed that clinician ratings of change were influenced primarily by symptom severity at discharge, rather than change from admission. LIMITATIONS: Only symptom scales were available as patient-reported outcomes, although clinician ratings may be based on other sources of information. In addition, no information was available on clinicians' experience with the rating scales used, nor is it clear how carefully the ratings were made. DISCUSSION: It can be concluded that failure to achieve treatment success and worsening after routine treatment for depression often go undetected on clinical rating scales, suggesting that such cases frequently remain undetected. Clinicians should generally obtain patient-reported outcomes during treatment to detect these cases.",2022,Mar 1,J Affect Disord,300,,322-325,34995701.0,10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.019,,#357,Kaiser 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The impact of Parkinson's disease and subthalamic deep brain stimulation on reward processing,"Evens, R.; Stankevich, Y.; Dshemuchadse, M.; Storch, A.; Wolz, M.; Reichmann, H.; Schlaepfer, T. E.; Goschke, T.; Lueken, U.","BACKGROUND: Due to its position in cortico-subthalamic and cortico-striatal pathways, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is considered to play a crucial role not only in motor, but also in cognitive and motivational functions. In the present study we aimed to characterize how different aspects of reward processing are affected by disease and deep brain stimulation of the STN (DBS-STN) in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We compared 33 PD patients treated with DBS-STN under best medical treatment (DBS-on, medication-on) to 33 PD patients without DBS, but optimized pharmacological treatment and 34 age-matched healthy controls. We then investigated DBS-STN effects using a postoperative stimulation-on/ -off design. The task set included a delay discounting task, a task to assess changes in incentive salience attribution, and the Iowa Gambling Task. RESULTS: The presence of PD was associated with increased incentive salience attribution and devaluation of delayed rewards. Acute DBS-STN increased risky choices in the Iowa Gambling Task under DBS-on condition, but did not further affect incentive salience attribution or the evaluation of delayed rewards. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that acute DBS-STN affects specific aspects of reward processing, including the weighting of gains and losses, while larger-scale effects of disease or medication are predominant in others reward-related functions.",2015,Aug,Neuropsychologia,75,,11-9,25976111.0,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.05.005,,#358,Evens 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Psychological distress, exhaustion, and work-related correlates among interpreters working in refugee care: results of a nationwide online survey in Germany","Geiling, A.; Knaevelsrud, C.; Bottche, M.; Stammel, N.","BACKGROUND: Due to language barriers, interpreters are crucial for refugee care in the countries of resettlement. However, interpreters are often faced with distressing working conditions, such as precarious work circumstances, lack of supervision, or exposure to their clients' traumatic experiences. Recent studies examining interpreters' mental health focussed primarily on secondary traumatic stress. The present study aimed to gain a better understanding of psychological distress and exhaustion among interpreters in refugee care by examining these factors in the work context as well as their possible work-related correlates. METHOD: An online survey was carried out in Germany, which included several standardized questionnaires regarding distress, work- and client-related exhaustion, job satisfaction, and trauma exposure (BSI-18, CBI, JSS, HTQ, PCL-5). Interpreters were recruited primarily through psychosocial treatment centres and interpreter pools in Germany. RESULTS: In total, 164 interpreters were included in the analyses. The participants showed increased psychological distress, and around 7% screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In an exploratory regression analysis, younger age (beta = -.25, p = .004) emerged as correlate of psychological distress, whereas dissatisfaction with payment (beta = -.21, p = .04) and a higher amount of traumatic content (beta = .22, p = .001) were associated with work-related exhaustion, and dissatisfaction with recognition was associated with client-related exhaustion (beta = -.35, p = .001). CONCLUSION: The results point to increased stress levels among interpreters for refugees. Moreover, they indicate that interpreters' distress is primarily correlated with work-related circumstances, thus suggesting the need for a greater work-related support structure for interpreters.",2022,2022/04/05,Eur J Psychotraumatol,13,1,2046954,35401951.0,10.1080/20008198.2022.2046954,,#359,Geiling 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Feasibility of Video Consultation for Preterm Neurodevelopmental Follow-up Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cohort Study,"Albayrak, B.; Cordier, L. J.; Greve, S.; Teschler, U.; Dathe, A. K.; Felderhoff-Muser, U.; Huning, B. M.","BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of infants born very preterm or at risk were exceptionally worried about being infected. The only means of protection during the onset of the pandemic was social distancing. Video consultations for neurodevelopmental follow-up care were offered as an alternative way to stay in contact with patients and their families, to provide expert support, and to monitor and assess children's development. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of and family satisfaction with video consultations, interviews were conducted after video and in-person consultations. METHODS: An interview with 28 questions was created to evaluate parental satisfaction with the consultations (eg, their confidentiality and the children's behavior). A total of 93 interviews with parents were conducted between March 2020 and February 2021 and compared (58 after video consultations and 35 after in-person consultations). The interviews were conducted at the end of the consultations by a trained professional. The video consultations were conducted using a certified platform created by Zava Sprechstunde Online, maintaining data protection with end-to-end encryption. Follow-up consultations (video or in-person) were performed at corrected ages of 3, 6, and 12 months as well as 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. The rate of total follow-up appointments attended during the survey period was evaluated and compared with the previous year. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the video and in-person consultation groups in satisfaction, attitudes on the confidentiality of the consultation, or discussion of private and sensitive information. Following video consultations, parents were significantly more likely to report that they were avoiding contact with medical professionals during the pandemic (P=.045; Shapiro-Wilk W=1094.5, Cohen d=-0.1782146) than the in-person consultation group. Parents in the video-consultation group stated that performing a guided examination on their child was comfortable and helped them understand their child's development. In fact, they agreed to take advantage of future video consultations. The rate of total follow-up appointments increased compared to the previous year. Between March 2019 and February 2020, 782 of 984 (79.5%) children born at Essen University Hospital attended a follow-up appointment. During the survey period, between March 2020 and February 2021, a total of 788 of 1086 children (73%) attended a follow-up appointment, of which 117 (14.9%) were video consultations. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of attending video consultations for follow-up care of very preterm or at-risk infants and parental satisfaction with these consultations were as high as for in-person consultations. Parents rated video consultations as being as confidential as in-person appointments. Telemedicine can be offered as an equivalent alternative to in-person consultations and is particularly useful under certain circumstances, such as for very sick children who require assistive devices or respiratory support and oxygen or for those living a long distance away.",2023,Jan 25,JMIR Pediatr Parent,6,,e40940,36409307.0,10.2196/40940,,#361,Albayrak 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Prolonged grief disorder three decades post loss in survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia,"Stammel, N.; Heeke, C.; Bockers, E.; Chhim, S.; Taing, S.; Wagner, B.; Knaevelsrud, C.","BACKGROUND: During the Khmer Rouge (KR) regime from 1975 to 1979 millions of Cambodians were confronted with the death or murder of family members. The long-term psychological consequences of these traumatic losses have not yet been investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate and potential predictors of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) in survivors of the KR regime. METHOD: The Inventory of Complicated Grief-Revised (ICG-R) was administered in a sample of N=775 Cambodians in face-to-face interviews who had lost at least one family member during the KR regime. Symptoms of PTSD were assessed with the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and symptoms of depression and anxiety with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25. RESULTS: The prevalence of PGD in the sample was 14.3%. PGD was moderately associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The loss of a spouse, a child, or a parent was associated with higher symptom severity of PGD than was the loss of a sibling or distant relatives. PGD was predicted by the relationship to the deceased and symptoms of depression and PTSD. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of the study include the non-random sampling recruitment. The ICG-R has not been validated for use in Cambodia. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of Cambodians lost family members during the KR regime. Even three decades later, PGD was prevalent in a substantial proportion of the present sample and related to other psychiatric disorders.

Association Between Prolonged Grief and Attitudes Toward Reconciliation in Bereaved Survivors of the Khmer Rouge Regime in Cambodia,"Stammel, N.; Heinzl, L.; Heeke, C.; Bottche, M.; Knaevelsrud, C.","BACKGROUND: During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, about a quarter of the population died, resulting in many individuals losing close relatives. Still today, many individuals are suffering from the psychological consequences of these losses, which might also affect the process of reconciliation within the Cambodian society. The aim of this paper is therefore to investigate the association between symptoms of prolonged grief and attitudes toward reconciliation. METHODS: A sample of 775 survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime who lost relatives during the conflict were interviewed about their losses and traumatic events, prolonged grief (PG; Complicated Grief Assessment Self-Report, CGA-SR), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version) and attitudes toward reconciliation (Readiness to Reconcile Inventory, RRI). RESULTS: A higher symptom severity of PG was significantly associated with readiness to reconcile even when controlling for other relevant variables (beta = -0.22; p <.001). Persons who met caseness criteria for PG were significantly less ready to reconcile, t(773) = 5.47, p <.001, than persons who did not meet caseness for PG.

Associations of Partnership Quality and Father-to-Child Attachment During the Peripartum Period. A Prospective-Longitudinal Study in Expectant Fathers,"Knappe, S.; Petzoldt, J.; Garthus-Niegel, S.; Wittich, J.; Puls, H. C.; Huttarsch, I.; Martini, J.","Background: During the transition to parenthood, a complex network of relationships unfolds between father, mother and the child. Expectant parents begin bonding with their unborn child, with this antenatal process supposedly being predictive for later postnatal attachment and child mental health. At the same time, couples may experience a change in partnership quality. While the majority of previous studies focused on associations between psychopathology, partnership quality and attachment from the perspective of mothers, the changes in partnership quality and attachment from the perspective of fathers has gained far less attention. Methods: Data were derived from the Maternal Anxiety and it's Relation to Infants' Development (MARI) study. N = 109 expectant fathers were recruited during mid-pregnancy (22 to 26 week of gestation). Lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders (DSM-IV) were assessed with a standardized diagnostic interview (CIDI). Paternal partnership characteristics and father-to-child attachments were assessed using standardized questionnaires at the second trimester, 10 days after delivery and 4 months after delivery in N = 76 fathers. Analyses were based on bivariate, robust and multivariate regression analyses. Results: Fathers did not report an overall decrease in partnership quality during the peripartum period. However, fathers with comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders reported lower partnership satisfaction at postpartum, as compared to unaffected fathers. Fathers with pure depressive disorders reported lower intensity of antenatal attachment. Paternal antenatal partnership quality was positively associated with antenatal father-to-child attachment. Furthermore, antenatal father-to-child attachment, as well as ante- and postnatal partnership quality in fathers, were positively related to postnatal father-to-child attachment. Conclusions: Antenatal father-to-child-attachment and paternal partnership quality appear to be promising targets for the prevention of postnatal attachment problems in fathers. The associations between partnership quality and attachment to the child further support an interpersonal approach in perinatal research, treatment and intervention, and may also feed into awareness programs that encourage expectant fathers to actively engage in relationships as early as during pregnancy-both with the mother and the unborn child.",2021,2021/04/20,Front Psychiatry,12,,572755,33959043.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2021.572755,,#364,Knappe 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Response to unexpected social inclusion: A study using the cyberball paradigm,"Groth, R. M.; Rief, W.","BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional expectations are considered core characteristics of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and should be focused in psychotherapy. Dysfunctional expectations are especially pronounced in the interpersonal area (social expectations). In the present study, we examine the effect of unexpected social inclusion (expectation violation) on the change of generalized and specific depression-typical social expectations. METHOD: We conducted an online study to investigate the impact of social inclusion after a period of social exclusion (unexpected social inclusion) on social expectation change (sample size 144) in a non-clinical sample. Depressive symptoms were assessed via self-reporting. Participants took part in two rounds of the online ball-game Cyberball. In the first round, all participants were socially excluded by their two co-players (acquisition of negative social expectations). In the second round, participants were either once more excluded (expectation confirmation) or included equally (expectation violation) by the same co-players. Specific and generalized social expectations were assessed after each round. RESULTS: Specific and generalized social expectations increased following expectation violation. Even though depressive symptoms were related to lower levels of social expectations, we found that depressive symptoms did not moderate expectation change after positive expectation violations. CONCLUSIONS: In the present experimental setup including the use of the online ball-game Cyberball, the establishment and change of social expectations can be experimentally manipulated. Under the given circumstances and in a non-clinical sample, negative expectations can be updated after unexpected positive experiences regardless of the number of depressive symptoms.

Integrating situation-specific dysfunctional expectations and dispositional optimism into the cognitive model of depression - A path-analytic approach,"Kube, T.; Siebers, V. H. A.; Herzog, P.; Glombiewski, J. A.; Doering, B. K.; Rief, W.","BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional expectations are considered to be core features of mental disorders and, in particular, major depression. The aim of the present study was to integrate two important types of expectations into the cognitive model of depression: situation-specific dysfunctional expectations (SDE) and dispositional optimism (DO). It was hypothesized that the influence of both DO and intermediate beliefs (IB) on depressive symptoms would be mediated via SDE. METHODS: We examined 95 individuals (age M = 40.7, 68.1% female) with a diagnosed major depressive disorder from two inpatient clinics and one outpatient clinic. Measurements used in the study included the Depressive Expectations Scale, Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, Life Orientation Test Revised, and Beck's Depression Inventory-II. Relationships between the constructs were analyzed using path-analytic models with bias-corrected bootstrapping confidence intervals. RESULTS: Results indicate that the effect of IB on depressive symptoms was fully mediated via SDE, while the effect of DO on depressive symptoms was partly mediated via SDE. IB and DO moderately correlated with each other. LIMITATIONS: Due to the cross-sectional design of the study, it is not possible to draw unambiguous conclusions regarding the causality of the suggested relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The present study stresses the crucial role of dysfunctional expectations for major depression. Moreover, it reveals that SDEs as expectations with a high level of situational specificity may pose an important link between global cognitions and depressive symptoms. Given this situational specificity, SDEs are amenable to disconfirmation through behavioral experiments and may therefore be a promising target for cognitive-behavioral interventions.",2018,Mar 15,J Affect Disord,229,,199-205,29324367.0,10.1016/j.jad.2017.12.082,,#366,Kube 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

OBJECTIVES: How and to what extent are E‑cigarettes used by smokers willing to quit? Are E‑cigarettes a useful intervention for smokers attending a group intervention for smoking cessation? MATERIALS AND METHODS: One year after attending a group intervention for smoking cessation in Germany, 637 attendants were assessed by telephone. The interview topics were the use of E‑cigarettes and tobacco abstinence. RESULTS: Of the attendants that could be interviewed, 12.6% had used E‑cigarettes during or after the smoking cessation intervention. At the beginning of the intervention these smokers smoked significantly more cigarettes and were more addicted to cigarettes than the other attendants. After one year significantly less E‑cigarette users were abstinent compared to participants that used nicotine replacement therapy or no additional smoking cessation aids. CONCLUSIONS: The application of E‑cigarettes is counterproductive for smokers looking for help in an abstinence oriented smoking cessation group. The lack of distinct, easy to follow instructions on the use of E‑cigarettes as a cessation tool may impair the process of cessation.

Prognostic or prescriptive biological markers assessed early posttrauma may inform personalized treatment recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To test prognostic and prescriptive effects of early (posttraumatic) autonomic and endocrine markers on PTSD symptom development. METHOD: Autonomic and endocrine markers were assessed within 12 days posttrauma and before treatment initiation within a randomized placebo-controlled trial investigating repeated oxytocin administration as preventive intervention for PTSD. Linear mixed effects models were used to test the effects of heart rate (variability), resting cortisol, morning cortisol and cortisol awakening response (CAR), cortisol suppression by dexamethasone and resting oxytocin on PTSD symptoms 1.5, 3 and 6 months posttrauma in men (n = 54), women using hormonal contraception (n = 27) and cycling women (n = 19). RESULTS: We found significant prognostic effects of resting oxytocin and cortisol suppression. In women using hormonal contraception, higher oxytocin was associated with higher PTSD symptoms across follow-up. Stronger cortisol suppression by dexamethasone, reflecting increased glucocorticoid receptor feedback sensitivity, was associated with lower PTSD symptoms across follow-up in men, but with higher symptoms at 1.5 months in women using hormonal contraception. These effects were independent of treatment condition. No further significant prognostic or prescriptive effects were detected. CONCLUSION: Our exploratory study indicates that resting oxytocin and glucocorticoid receptor feedback sensitivity early posttrauma are associated with subsequent PTSD symptom severity. Notably, prognostic effects depended on sex and hormonal contraception use, emphasizing the necessity to consider these factors in biomedical PTSD research.",2020,Jun 8,Eur J Psychotraumatol,11,1,1761622,32922686.0,10.1080/20008198.2020.1761622,,#370,Engel 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Effects of electroconvulsive therapy on amygdala function in major depression - a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging study,"Redlich, R.; Burger, C.; Dohm, K.; Grotegerd, D.; Opel, N.; Zaremba, D.; Meinert, S.; Forster, K.; Repple, J.; Schnelle, R.; Wagenknecht, C.; Zavorotnyy, M.; Heindel, W.; Kugel, H.; Gerbaulet, M.; Alferink, J.; Arolt, V.; Zwanzger, P.; Dannlowski, U.","BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for severe depression. However, little is known regarding brain functional processes mediating ECT effects. METHOD: In a non-randomized prospective study, functional magnetic resonance imaging data during the automatic processing of subliminally presented emotional faces were obtained twice, about 6 weeks apart, in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) before and after treatment with ECT (ECT, n = 24). Additionally, a control sample of MDD patients treated solely with pharmacotherapy (MED, n = 23) and a healthy control sample (HC, n = 22) were obtained. RESULTS: Before therapy, both patient groups equally showed elevated amygdala reactivity to sad faces compared with HC. After treatment, a decrease in amygdala activity to negative stimuli was discerned in both patient samples indicating a normalization of amygdala function, suggesting mechanisms potentially unspecific for ECT. Moreover, a decrease in amygdala activity to sad faces was associated with symptomatic improvements in the ECT sample (r spearman = -0.48, p = 0.044), and by tendency also for the MED sample (r spearman = -0.38, p = 0.098). However, we did not find any significant association between pre-treatment amygdala function to emotional stimuli and individual symptom improvement, neither for the ECT sample, nor for the MED sample.

The American and German validation studies resulted in a three-factor structure (concealing, adjusting, and tolerating). The present study aimed to investigate three aspects: (1) the validation of the ASQ within a clinical sample, (2) the examination of possible differences in affective styles between patients suffering from affective versus anxiety disorders, and (3) the association of affective styles and anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. METHODS: Overall 917 patients receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy at an outpatient clinic participated in this study, 550 participants were female. All data were collected before the beginning of treatment. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed the same three-factor structure found in the previous Western samples (CFI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.06): Concealing (alpha = 0.81), adjusting (alpha = 0.71), and tolerating (alpha = 0.70). Significantly lower scores in the ASQ subscale adjusting were found in patients suffering from affective disorders than patients suffering from anxiety disorders. The results of the regression analyses showed that the ASQ adjusting and concealing behavior seem to play a more important role than the ERQ reappraisal and suppression for depression, anxiety, and stress among clinical populations. LIMITATIONS: A number of limitations must be taken into consideration while evaluating the present study. First and foremost, the clinical data were based on primary diagnoses. We did not ascertain comorbid diagnoses. This distinction may be important, since affective and anxiety disorders are often linked to each other. In addition, we only used data collected before the beginning of psychotherapeutic treatment and were therefore not able to analyze changes in affective styles during and after intervention. Furthermore, all data were based on self-reported information of patients. We did not implement either a therapeutic rating of affective styles or physiological measures, for instance arousal, which could have shown whether the used strategies successfully reduce negative emotions. Future research should address this question. Another limitation is the fact that we concentrated on the main categories of mental disorders and, therefore, did not subdivide patients with affective and anxiety disorders in terms of their concrete diagnoses. This is of special importance, because there might also be differences in affective styles within the main categories.",2018,Oct 1,J Affect Disord,238,,392-398,29909302.0,10.1016/j.jad.2018.05.035,,#372,Totzeck 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Looking at food in sad mood: do attention biases lead emotional eaters into overeating after a negative mood induction?,"Werthmann, J.; Renner, F.; Roefs, A.; Huibers, M. J.; Plumanns, L.; Krott, N.; Jansen, A.","BACKGROUND: Emotional eating is associated with overeating and the development of obesity. Yet, empirical evidence for individual (trait) differences in emotional eating and cognitive mechanisms that contribute to eating during sad mood remain equivocal. AIM: The aim of this study was to test if attention bias for food moderates the effect of self-reported emotional eating during sad mood (vs neutral mood) on actual food intake. It was expected that emotional eating is predictive of elevated attention for food and higher food intake after an experimentally induced sad mood and that attentional maintenance on food predicts food intake during a sad versus a neutral mood. METHOD: Participants (N = 85) were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental mood induction conditions (sad/neutral). Attentional biases for high caloric foods were measured by eye tracking during a visual probe task with pictorial food and neutral stimuli. Self-reported emotional eating was assessed with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) and ad libitum food intake was tested by a disguised food offer. RESULTS: Hierarchical multivariate regression modeling showed that self-reported emotional eating did not account for changes in attention allocation for food or food intake in either condition. Yet, attention maintenance on food cues was significantly related to increased intake specifically in the neutral condition, but not in the sad mood condition. DISCUSSION: The current findings show that self-reported emotional eating (based on the DEBQ) might not validly predict who overeats when sad, at least not in a laboratory setting with healthy women. Results further suggest that attention maintenance on food relates to eating motivation when in a neutral affective state, and might therefore be a cognitive mechanism contributing to increased food intake in general, but maybe not during sad mood.",2014,Apr,Eat Behav,15,2,230-6,24854809.0,10.1016/j.eatbeh.2014.02.001,,#373,Werthmann 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Validation and application of the Non-Verbal Behavior Analyzer: An automated tool to assess non-verbal emotional expressions in psychotherapy,"Terhurne, P.; Schwartz, B.; Baur, T.; Schiller, D.; Eberhardt, S. T.; Andre, E.; Lutz, W.","BACKGROUND: Emotions play a key role in psychotherapy. However, a problem with examining emotional states via self-report questionnaires is that the assessment usually takes place after the actual emotion has been experienced which might lead to biases and continuous human ratings are time and cost intensive. Using the AI-based software package Non-Verbal Behavior Analyzer (NOVA), video-based emotion recognition of arousal and valence can be applied in naturalistic psychotherapeutic settings. In this study, four emotion recognition models (ERM) each based on specific feature sets (facial: OpenFace, OpenFace-Aureg; body: OpenPose-Activation, OpenPose-Energy) were developed and compared in their ability to predict arousal and valence scores correlated to PANAS emotion scores and processes of change (interpersonal experience, coping experience, affective experience) as well as symptoms (depression and anxiety in HSCL-11). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 183 patient therapy videos were divided into a training sample (55 patients), a test sample (50 patients), and a holdout sample (78 patients). The best ERM was selected for further analyses. Then, ERM based arousal and valence scores were correlated with patient and therapist estimates of emotions and processes of change. Furthermore, using regression models arousal and valence were examined as predictors of symptom severity in depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The ERM based on OpenFace produced the best agreement to the human coder rating. Arousal and valence correlated significantly with therapists' ratings of sadness, shame, anxiety, and relaxation, but not with the patient ratings of their own emotions. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation indicates that negative valence was associated with higher affective experience. Negative valence was found to significantly predict higher anxiety but not depression scores. CONCLUSION: This study shows that emotion recognition with NOVA can be used to generate ERMs associated with patient emotions, affective experiences and symptoms. Nevertheless, limitations were obvious. It seems necessary to improve the ERMs using larger databases of sessions and the validity of ERMs needs to be further investigated in different samples and different applications. Furthermore, future research should take ERMs to identify emotional synchrony between patient and therapists into account.",2022,2022/10/28,Front Psychiatry,13,,1026015,36386975.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1026015,,#374,Terhurne 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Development and Validation of the Readiness for End-of-Life Conversations (REOLC) Scale,"Berlin, P.; Leppin, N.; Nagelschmidt, K.; Seifart, C.; Rief, W.; von Blanckenburg, P.","Background: Engaging in end-of-life care considerations is beneficial when the time is right. The purpose of this study is to provide a valid instrument to assess peoples readiness for end-of-life conversations before they are initiated. Materials and Methods: A community sample was recruited in study one for exploratory factor analysis of a 13-item questionnaire. In study two, psychometric properties were analyzed with structural equation modeling in a population affected by cancer. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed with questionnaires measuring distress, depression, anxiety, fear of progression, and distress of death and dying. Results: In study one (N = 349) exploratory factor analysis resulted in three subscales readiness (alpha = 0.84), communication (alpha = 0.76), and values (alpha = 0.56) with a possible common factor (alpha = 0.84) for a community sample. In study two (N = 84) the three-factor solution with 13 items was not supported for cancer patients. Factor structure was adapted to 12 items with one common factor readiness (alpha = 0.87). Model fit was good: chi(2)(50) = 59.18, p>0.05 (Satorra-Bentler-correction = 1.27), with chi(2)/df = 1.184, rRMSEA = 0.053 (90%-CI[0.000;0.100]), and rSRMR = 0.072. Convergent validity was supported by moderate correlations to trait gratitude, ratings of readiness to provide a living will or talk with family about the end of life. Divergent validity was supported by no or small correlation with distress, depression, general and death anxiety and fear of progression, respectively. Conclusions: Results support usage of the REOLC Scale in different settings with adapted factor structure.

Look at the Audience? A Randomized Controlled Study of Shifting Attention From Self-Focus to Nonsocial vs. Social External Stimuli During Virtual Reality Exposure to Public Speaking in Social Anxiety,"Wechsler, T. F.; Pfaller, M.; van Eickels, R. E.; Schulz, L. H.; Muhlberger, A.","Background: Enhanced self-focused attention plays a central role in the maintenance and treatment of Social Anxiety and is targeted in contemporary cognitive behavioral therapy. Actual developments use Virtual Reality (VR) for behavioral training. However, no VR attention training combining exposure to public speaking with shifting attention from self-focus to external focus has been investigated, and no experimental evidence exists on different kinds of external cues as targets of attention. Therefore, we investigated the effects of an attention training during public speaking in VR and examined differential effects of an external focus on nonsocial vs. social stimuli. Methods: In this randomized controlled study, highly socially anxious participants were instructed to focus on either objects or the audience within a virtual speech task. We assessed the pre-post effects on affective reactions, self-perception, and attentional processes during public speaking as well as general Social Anxiety using subjective, physiological, and eye-tracking measures. Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were calculated to detect changes from pretest to posttest over both groups, and time x group interaction effects. Results: Within the analysis sample (n = 41), anxiety during public speaking and fear of negative evaluation significantly decreased, with no significant differences between groups. No significant time effect, but a significant time x group effect, was found for the looking time proportion on the audience members' heads. Follow-up tests confirmed a significant increase in the social-focus group and a significant decrease in the nonsocial-focus group. For all other variables, except external focus and fear of public speaking, significant improvements were found over both groups. Further significant time x group effects were found for positive affect during public speaking, with a significant increase in the social focus, and no significant change in the nonsocial-focus group. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that attention training to reduce self-focus can be successfully conducted in VR. Both training versions showed positive short-term effects in the highly socially anxious, with particular advantages of an external social focus concerning eye contact to the audience and positive affect. Further research should investigate whether social focus is even more advantageous long term and if reinterpretations of dysfunctional beliefs could be achieved by not avoiding social cues.",2021,2021/12/14,Front Psychiatry,12,,751272,34970163.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2021.751272,,#376,Wechsler 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Post-stroke depression and post-stroke anxiety: prevalence and predictors,"Schottke, H.; Giabbiconi, C. M.","BACKGROUND: Epidemiological research on post-stroke affective disorders has been mainly focusing on post-stroke depression (PSD). In contrast, research on post-stroke anxiety (PSA) is in its early stages. The present study proposes a broad picture on post-stroke affective disorders, including PSD and PSA in German stroke in-patients during rehabilitation. In addition, we investigated whether lifetime affective disorders predict the emergence of PSD and PSA. METHODS: 289 stroke patients were assessed in the early weeks following stroke for a range of mood and anxiety disorders by means of the Structured Clinical Interview relying on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV. This assessment was conducted for two periods: for post-stroke and retroactively for the period preceding stroke (lifetime). The covariation between PSD and PSA was investigated using Spearman-rho correlation. Predictors of PSD and PSA prevalence based on the respective lifetime prevalence were investigated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: PSD prevalence was 31.1%, PSA prevalence was 20.4%. We also found significant correlations between depression and anxiety at post-stroke and for the lifetime period. Interestingly, lifetime depression could not predict the emergence of PSD. In contrast, lifetime anxiety was a good predictor of PSA. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to highlight the complexity of post-stroke affective disorders by strengthening the comorbidity of depression and anxiety. In addition, we contrasted the predictability of PSA based on its lifetime history compared to PSD which was not predictable based on lifetime depression.",2015,Nov,Int Psychogeriatr,27,11,1805-12,26178418.0,10.1017/S1041610215000988,,#378,Schottke 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Benefits of Individualized Feedback in Internet-Based Interventions for Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Zagorscak, P.; Heinrich, M.; Sommer, D.; Wagner, B.; Knaevelsrud, C.","BACKGROUND: Even though there is an increasing number of studies on the efficacy of Internet-based interventions (IBI) for depression, experimental trials on the benefits of added guidance by clinicians are scarce and inconsistent. This study compared the efficacy of semistandardized feedback provided by psychologists with fully standardized feedback in IBI. METHODS: Participants with mild-to-moderate depression (n = 1,089, 66% female) from the client pool of a health insurance company participated in a cognitive-behavioral IBI targeting depression over 6 weeks. Individuals were randomized to weekly semistandardized e-mail feedback from psychologists (individual counseling; IC) or to automated, standardized feedback where a psychologist could be contacted on demand (CoD). The contents and tasks were identical across conditions. The primary outcome was depression; secondary outcomes included anxiety, rumination, and well-being. Outcomes were assessed before and after the intervention and 3, 6, and 12 months later. Changes in outcomes were evaluated using latent change score modeling. RESULTS: Both interventions yielded large pre-post effects on depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II: dIC = 1.53, dCoD = 1.37; Patient Health Questionnaire-9: dIC = 1.20, dCoD = 1.04), as well as significant improvements of all other outcome measures. The effects remained significant after 3, 6, and 12 months. The groups differed with regard to attrition (IC: 17.3%, CoD: 25.8%, p = 0.001). Between-group effects were statistically nonsignificant across outcomes and measurement occasions. CONCLUSION: Adding semistandardized guidance in IBI for depression did not prove to be more effective than fully standardized feedback on primary and secondary outcomes, but it had positive effects on attrition.",2018,,Psychother Psychosom,87,1,32-45,29306945.0,10.1159/000481515,,#381,Zagorscak 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Do lifetime anxiety disorders (anxiety liability) and pregnancy-related anxiety predict complications during pregnancy and delivery?,"Hoyer, J.; Wieder, G.; Hofler, M.; Krause, L.; Wittchen, H. U.; Martini, J.","BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that maternal anxiety is associated with adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes, such as preterm birth, vaginal bleedings and low birth weight. AIMS: To examine the association of lifetime anxiety disorders and pregnancy-related anxiety and complications during pregnancy and delivery. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective-longitudinal study (MARI). SUBJECTS: N = 306 pregnant women who were investigated repeatedly during the peripartum period. OUTCOME MEASURES: Information on lifetime anxiety disorders was assessed using a dimensional score (lifetime anxiety liability index) based on the standardized Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V). Pregnancy-related anxiety was surveyed with the Pregnancy and Childbirth Related Fears (PCF) questionnaire. Common pregnancy (e.g. vaginal bleedings) and delivery complications (e.g. labor induction) were assessed via medical records, interviews and questionnaires. RESULTS: The global tests on the association between lifetime anxiety liability and pregnancy complications and on the association between pregnancy-related anxiety and pregnancy/delivery complications revealed significant associations. Further analyses revealed associations of lifetime anxiety liability with preterm labor (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.0) as well as pregnancy-related anxiety with vaginal bleedings (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-1.8), preterm labor (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.0-1.7), gestational diabetes (OR 0.5, 95% CI = 0.2-0.9), labor induction (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9) and use of labor medication (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.0). After adjustment for maternal age, maternal body mass index, maternal smoking, socioeconomic status (occupation, household income) and social support (cohabitation), the associations between pregnancy-related anxiety and labor induction as well as use of labor medication remained significant.

Online training for evidence-based child trauma treatment: evaluation of the German language TF-CBT-Web,"Kasparik, B.; Saupe, L. B.; Makitalo, S.; Rosner, R.","BACKGROUND: Evidence-based trauma-focused interventions for treating PTSD in children and youth are barely used in practice. Web-based training has proven to be an effective way of transferring knowledge to healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVE: TF-CBT Web is a web-based training programme designed to foster the dissemination of Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT) for children and youth, and is run by the Medical University of South Carolina. This paper describes the characteristics of healthcare professionals who registered for the adapted German language version of TF-CBT Web. It evaluates the effectiveness and user friendliness of the programme. METHOD: : Similar to the TF-CBT treatment manual, the German language TF-CBT Web contains 12 modules. Between 2018 and 2020, 4,020 users registered for the programme. During the registration process users provided demographic information. The knowledge of users regarding the TF-CBT components was assessed via pre-tests and post-tests in each module. RESULTS: The programme was accessed by a sample of mostly German users with varying professional health care backgrounds and a wide-ranging spread of work experience. The results indicated a significant knowledge gain and high rates of user satisfaction with the programme. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the results of this study suggested that web-based training is an effective and well-accepted method for knowledge gain in trauma-focused interventions. Future research should evaluate the actual application of the taught methods in clinical practice. HIGHLIGHTS: Children and adolescents with PTSD require trauma-focused treatment. However, evidence-based interventions for this patient population are barely used. Therefore, it is necessary to expand professional training for the treatment of traumatised children and adolescents.Our evaluation showed the effectiveness and feasibility of a web-based training programme for mental health practitioners in an evidence-based treatment for children and youth with PTSD (TF-CBT).

Transdiagnostic efficacy of a group exercise intervention for outpatients with heterogenous psychiatric disorders: a randomized controlled trial,"Zeibig, J. M.; Seiffer, B.; Sudeck, G.; Rosel, I.; Hautzinger, M.; Wolf, S.","BACKGROUND: Exercise efficaciously reduces disorder-specific symptoms of psychiatric disorders. The current study aimed to examine the efficacy of a group exercise intervention on global symptom severity and disorder-specific symptoms among a mixed outpatient sample. METHODS: Groups of inactive outpatients, waiting for psychotherapy, with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, insomnia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders were randomized to a manualized 12-week exercise intervention, combining moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise with techniques for sustainable exercise behaviour change (n = 38, female = 71.1% (n = 27), M(age) = 36.66), or a passive control group (n = 36, female = 75.0% (n = 27), M(age) = 34.33). Primary outcomes were global symptom severity and disorder-specific symptoms, measured with the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index pre- and post-treatment. Secondary outcome was the self-reported amount of exercise (Physical Activity, Exercise, and Sport Questionnaire), measured pre-treatment, intermediate-, and post-treatment. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using linear mixed models. Linear regressions were conducted to examine the effect of the change of exercise behaviour on the change of symptoms. RESULTS: The intervention significantly improved global symptom severity (d = 0.77, p = .007), depression (d = 0.68, p = .015), anxiety (d = 0.87, p = .002), sleep quality (d = 0.88, p = .001), and increased the amount of exercise (d = 0.82, p < .001), compared to the control group. Post-treatment differences between groups were significant for depression (d = 0.63, p = .031), sleep quality (d = 0.61, p = .035) and the amount of exercise (d = 1.45, p < .001). Across both groups, the reduction of global symptom severity was significantly predicted by an increase of exercise (b = .35, p = .012). CONCLUSIONS: The exercise intervention showed transdiagnostic efficacy among a heterogeneous clinical sample in a realistic outpatient setting and led to sustained exercise behaviour change. Exercise may serve as an efficacious and feasible transdiagnostic treatment option improving the existing treatment gap within outpatient mental health care settings.

How expectancy violations facilitate learning to cope with pain - An experimental approach,"Kube, T.; Korfer, K.; Riecke, J.; Glombiewski, J. A.","BACKGROUND: Expectations of painful sensations constitute a core feature of chronic pain. An important clinical question is whether such expectations are revised when disconfirming experiences are made (e.g., less pain than expected). This study examined how people adjust their pain expectations when the experience of decreasing pain is expected vs. unexpected. METHODS: In a novel randomized between-subjects design, a subclinical sample of people who frequently experience pain was provided with painful thermal stimulations. Unbeknownst to participants, the temperature applied was decreased from trial to trial. Based on the experimental instructions provided, this experience of decreasing pain was expected in one condition (expectation-confirmation; n = 34), whereas it was unexpected in another (expectation-disconfirmation; n = 39). RESULTS: Perceived pain intensity was lower in the expectation-confirmation condition than in the expectation-disconfirmation condition (p = .014, eta(p)(2) = 0.083). The expectation-confirmation condition also showed a greater adjustment of their pain expectations than the expectation-disconfirmation condition (p = .046, eta(p)(2) = 0.047). Across groups, large expectation violations (i.e., less pain than expected) were associated with increases in pain tolerance and the ability to cope with pain at a one-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of assimilation, perceived pain intensity was shaped in the direction of pain expectations. The greater adjustment of expectations in the expectation-confirming condition is consistent with a confirmation bias in pain perception. Though participants who experienced large discrepancies between expected and experienced pain were hesitant to adjust their pain expectations immediately, expectation violations increased their ability to cope with pain one week later, suggesting some beneficial longer-term effects of expectation violations.",2022,Jun,J Psychosom Res,157,,110807,35390722.0,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2022.110807,,#385,Kube 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Mechanisms of exposure and response prevention in obsessive-compulsive disorder: effects of habituation and expectancy violation on short-term outcome in cognitive behavioral therapy,"Elsner, B.; Jacobi, T.; Kischkel, E.; Schulze, D.; Reuter, B.","BACKGROUND: Exposure and response prevention is effective and recommended as the first choice for treating obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). Its mechanisms of action are rarely studied, but two major theories make distinct assumptions: while the emotional processing theory assumes that treatment effects are associated with habituation within and between exposure sessions, the inhibitory learning approach highlights the acquisition of additional associations, implying alternative mechanisms like expectancy violation. The present study aimed to investigate whether process variables derived from both theories predict short-term outcome. METHOD: In a university outpatient unit, 110 patients (63 female) with OCD received manual-based cognitive-behavioral therapy with high standardization of the first two exposure sessions. Specifically, therapists repeated the first exposure session identically and assessed subjective units of distress as well as expectancy ratings in the course of exposure sessions. Based on these data, individual scores for habituation and distress-related expectancy violation were calculated and used for prediction of both percentage change on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and remission status after 20 therapy sessions. RESULTS: In a multiple regression model for percentage change, within-session habituation during the first exposure was a significant predictor, while in a logistic regression predicting remission status, distress-related expectancy violation during the first exposure revealed significance. A path model further supported these findings. CONCLUSIONS: The results represent first evidence for distress-related expectancy violation and confirm preliminary findings for habituation, suggesting that both processes contribute to treatment benefits of exposure in OCD, and both mechanisms appear to be independent.",2022,Jan 27,BMC Psychiatry,22,1,66,35086513.0,10.1186/s12888-022-03701-z,,#386,Elsner 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
How am I doing compared to different standards? Comparative thinking and well-being following exposure to a vehicle-ramming attack,"Morina, N.","Background: Exposure to potentially adverse events might intensify thinking about different comparison standards in relation to one's own well-being. Objective: To examine how frequently survivors of a recent potentially traumatic event use different comparison standards to evaluate their current well-being. Method: A survey with 223 participants directly or indirectly exposed to a vehicle-ramming attack was conducted. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, quality of life, and the sum score of the frequency of different types of comparison standards were assessed. The latter consisted of temporal, counterfactual, social, dimensional, and criteria-based comparisons. Results: In total, 98% of participants reported some form of comparative thinking during the last two weeks. The most frequent comparison types were temporal and dimensional comparisons, with 94 and 87% of participants reporting them, respectively. Notably, comparative thinking predicted unique variance in PTSD symptoms, over and above depressive symptoms.

Generalizability of harm and pain expectations after exposure in chronic low back pain patients,"Riecke, J.; Rief, W.; Vlaeyen, J. W. S.; Glombiewski, J. A.","BACKGROUND: Exposure treatments are shown to be effective in reducing pain-related fear and the perceived harmfulness of physical activities. However, due to the fragility of extinction its stability is questionable. We investigated the generalizability of exposure effects in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients by integrating a behavioral test in the context of an intervention study. METHODS: The study is an additional analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of exposure in vivo. A total of 67 CLBP patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: Exposure-short (EXP-S); exposure-long (EXP-L) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Participants rated the expected harmfulness of daily activities (Photograph Series of Daily Activities) before and after therapy. Post-treatment participants were confronted with an individually tailored, threatening movement in a new context. Harm and pain expectations before the exposure were compared to the actual experience after exposure. RESULTS: We found that EXP leads to more strongly reduced harm expectations (F(2,50) = 11.37, p < .001, eta(2) = 0.31) compared to CBT, regardless of the duration of EXP. After therapy, patients expected less harm (F(2,50) = 3.61, p = .034, eta(2) = 0.13) but not less pain (F(2,50) = 3.61, p = .034, eta(2) = 0.13) when confronted with a novel movement. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure successfully reduced harm but not pain expectations in patients with CLBP. Further, preliminary results showed that these specific exposure effects were generalized to a novel activity in a different context outside therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigats the generalizability and stability of exposure effects in patients with CLBP by combining a behavioral test with an intervention study. We found strong and stable effects on harm expectations but not on pain expectations. Results show promising preliminary evidence that reduced harm expectations can be generalized to a novel threatening activity in a new context.

Individual differences in cognitive reappraisal usage modulate the time course of brain activation during symptom provocation in specific phobia,"Hermann, A.; Leutgeb, V.; Scharmuller, W.; Vaitl, D.; Schienle, A.; Stark, R.","BACKGROUND: Extinction learning is proposed to be one key mechanism of action underlying exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in specific phobia. Beyond that, cognitive reappraisal, one important strategy to regulate negative emotions, is a crucial component of CBT interventions, but has been disregarded in previous studies investigating neural change processes in specific phobia. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of individual differences in habitual/dispositional cognitive reappraisal usage and the time course of brain activation during phobic stimulation in specific phobia. METHODS: Dental phobic patients and healthy control subjects participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study whilst being confronted with phobic, disgust, fear and neutral pictures. Individual differences in cognitive reappraisal usage were assessed via a self-report questionnaire and correlated with activation decreases over the course of time. RESULTS: Phobic individuals with higher dispositional cognitive reappraisal scores showed a more pronounced activation decline in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) which might be associated with a diminution of explicit cognitive emotion regulation over the course of time. Less decrease of activation in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) over time in subjects with higher cognitive reappraisal scores might be related to a stronger automatic regulation of emotions or even emotional relearning. Additionally, phobic subjects compared with healthy controls showed a stronger habituation of the left dmPFC over the course of symptom provocation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show for the first time that individual differences in cognitive reappraisal usage are associated with the time course of brain activation during symptom provocation in specific phobia. Additionally, the present study gives first indications for the importance of considering individual differences in cognitive reappraisal usage in the treatment of specific phobia.",2013,Aug 12,Biol Mood Anxiety Disord,3,1,16,23937792.0,10.1186/2045-5380-3-16,,#389,Hermann 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Brain structural connectivity and context-dependent extinction memory,"Hermann, A.; Stark, R.; Blecker, C. R.; Milad, M. R.; Merz, C. J.","BACKGROUND: Extinction of conditioned fear represents an important mechanism in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Return of fear after successful extinction or exposure therapy in patients with anxiety disorders might be linked to poor temporal or contextual generalization of extinction due to individual differences in brain structural connectivity. The goal of this magnetic resonance imaging study was therefore to investigate the association of context-dependent extinction recall with brain structural connectivity. METHODS: Diffusion-tensor imaging was used to determine the fractional anisotropy as a measure of white matter structural integrity of fiber tracts connecting central brain regions of the fear and extinction circuit (uncinate fasciculus, cingulum). Forty-five healthy men participated in a two-day fear conditioning experiment with fear acquisition in context A and extinction learning in context B on the first day. Extinction recall in the extinction context as well as renewal in the acquisition context and a novel context C took place one day later. RESULTS: Renewal of conditioned fear (skin conductance responses) in the acquisition context was associated with higher structural integrity of the hippocampal part of the cingulum. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced structural integrity of the cingulum might be related to stronger hippocampal modulation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a region important for modulating conditioned fear output by excitatory projections to the amygdala. This finding underpins the crucial role of individual differences in the structural integrity of relevant fiber tracts for context-dependent extinction recall and return of fear after exposure therapy in anxiety disorders.",2017,Aug,Hippocampus,27,8,883-889,28498605.0,10.1002/hipo.22738,,#390,Hermann 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Neurophysiological correlates of holistic face processing in adolescents with and without autism spectrum disorder,"Naumann, S.; Senftleben, U.; Santhosh, M.; McPartland, J.; Webb, S. J.","BACKGROUND: Face processing has been found to be impaired in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). One hypothesis is that individuals with ASD engage in piecemeal compared to holistic face processing strategies. To investigate the role of possible impairments in holistic face processing in individuals with autism, the current study investigated behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of face processing (P1/N170 and gamma-band activity) in adolescents with ASD and sex-, age-, and IQ-matched neurotypical controls. METHODS: Participants were presented with upright and inverted Mooney stimuli; black and white low information faces that are only perceived as faces when processed holistically. Participants indicated behaviorally the detection of a face. EEG was collected time-locked to the presentation of the stimuli. RESULTS: Adolescents with ASD perceived Mooney stimuli as faces suggesting ability to use holistic processing but displayed a lower face detection rate and slower response times. ERP components suggest slowed temporal processing of Mooney stimuli in the ASD compared to control group for P1 latency but no differences between groups for P1 amplitude and at the N170. Increases in gamma-band activity was similar during the perception of the Mooney images by group, but the ASD group showed prolonged temporal elevation in activity. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results suggest that adolescents with ASD were able to utilize holistic processing to perceive a face within the Mooney stimuli. Delays in early processing, marked by the P1, and elongated elevation in gamma activity indicate that the neural systems supporting holistic processing are slightly altered suggesting a less automatic and less efficient facial processing system.

Developmental aspects of fear generalization - A MEG study on neurocognitive correlates in adolescents versus adults,"Roesmann, K.; Wessing, I.; Krass, S.; Leehr, E. J.; Klucken, T.; Straube, T.; Junghofer, M.","BACKGROUND: Fear generalization is pivotal for the survival-promoting avoidance of potential danger, but, if too pronounced, it promotes pathological anxiety. Similar to adult patients with anxiety disorders, healthy children tend to show overgeneralized fear responses. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate neuro-developmental aspects of fear generalization in adolescence - a critical age for the development of anxiety disorders. METHODS: We compared healthy adolescents (14-17 years) with healthy adults (19-34 years) regarding their fear responses towards tilted Gabor gratings (conditioned stimuli, CS; and slightly differently titled generalization stimuli, GS). In the conditioning phase, CS were paired (CS+) or remained unpaired (CS-) with an aversive stimulus (unconditioned stimuli, US). In the test phase, behavioral, peripheral and neural responses to CS and GS were captured by fear- and UCS expectancy ratings, a perceptual discrimination task, pupil dilation and source estimations of event-related magnetic fields. RESULTS: Closely resembling adults, adolescents showed robust generalization gradients of fear ratings, pupil dilation, and estimated neural source activity. However, in the UCS expectancy ratings, adolescents revealed shallower generalization gradients indicating overgeneralization. Moreover, adolescents showed stronger visual cortical activity after as compared to before conditioning to all stimuli. CONCLUSION: Various aspects of fear learning and generalization appear to be mature in healthy adolescents. Yet, cognitive aspects might show a slower course of development.",2022,Dec,Dev Cogn Neurosci,58,,101169,36356485.0,10.1016/j.dcn.2022.101169,,#394,Roesmann 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Video feedback on functional task performance improves self-awareness after traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial,"Schmidt, J.; Fleming, J.; Ownsworth, T.; Lannin, N. A.","BACKGROUND: Feedback is used in rehabilitation to improve self-awareness in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but there have been no comparisons of the different methods of providing feedback. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of different methods of feedback on impaired self-awareness after TBI. METHOD: This was a randomized, assessor-blinded trial with concealed allocation. A total of 54 participants with TBI and impaired self-awareness (85% male) were recruited from inpatient and community rehabilitation settings. Participants performed a meal preparation task on 4 occasions and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 feedback intervention groups: video plus verbal feedback, verbal feedback, or experiential feedback. The primary outcome was improvement in online awareness measured by the number of errors made during task completion. Secondary outcomes included level of intellectual awareness, self-perception of rehabilitation, and emotional status. RESULTS: Receiving video plus verbal feedback reduced the number of errors more than verbal feedback alone (mean difference = 19.7 errors; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.2-30.1) and experiential feedback alone (mean difference = 12.4 errors; 95% CI = 1.8-23.0). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the video plus verbal feedback approach used in this study was effective in improving self-awareness in people with TBI. The results also provide evidence that improvement in self-awareness was not accompanied by deterioration in emotional status.",2013,May,Neurorehabil Neural Repair,27,4,316-24,23270921.0,10.1177/1545968312469838,,#395,Schmidt 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Conflict monitoring and adaptation as reflected by N2 amplitude in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Riesel, A.; Klawohn, J.; Kathmann, N.; Endrass, T.","BACKGROUND: Feelings of doubt and perseverative behaviours are key symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and have been linked to hyperactive error and conflict signals in the brain. While enhanced neural correlates of error monitoring have been robustly shown, far less is known about conflict processing and adaptation in OCD. METHOD: We examined event-related potentials during conflict processing in 70 patients with OCD and 70 matched healthy comparison participants, focusing on the stimulus-locked N2 elicited in a flanker task. Conflict adaptation was evaluated by analysing sequential adjustments in N2 and behaviour, i.e. current conflict effects as a function of preceding conflict. RESULTS: Patients with OCD showed enhanced N2 amplitudes compared with healthy controls. Further, patients showed stronger conflict adaptation effects on reaction times and N2 amplitude. Thus, the effect of previous compatibility was larger in patients than in healthy participants as indicated by greater N2 adjustments in change trials (i.e. iC, cI). As a result of stronger conflict adaptation in patients, N2 amplitudes were comparable between groups in incompatible trials following incompatible trials. CONCLUSIONS: Larger N2 amplitudes and greater conflict adaptation in OCD point to enhanced conflict monitoring leading to increased recruitment of cognitive control in patients. This was most pronounced in change trials and was associated with stronger conflict adjustment in N2 and behaviour. Thus, hyperactive conflict monitoring in OCD may be beneficial in situations that require a high amount of control to resolve conflict, but may also reflect an effortful process that is linked to distress and symptoms of OCD.",2017,Jun,Psychol Med,47,8,1379-1388,28095945.0,10.1017/S0033291716003597,,#396,Riesel 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Maternal avoidance, anxiety cognitions and interactive behaviour predicts infant development at 12 months in the context of anxiety disorders in the postpartum period","Reck, C.; Van Den Bergh, B.; Tietz, A.; Muller, M.; Ropeter, A.; Zipser, B.; Pauen, S.","BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the relation between anxiety disorders in the postpartum period and cognitive as well as language development in infancy. AIMS: This longitudinal study investigated whether anxiety disorder in the postpartum period is linked to infant development at twelve months. A closer look was also taken at a possible link between maternal interaction and infant development. STUDY DESIGN: Subjects were videotaped during a Face-to-Face-Still-Face interaction with their infant (M = 4.0 months). Specific maternal anxiety symptoms were measured by self-report questionnaires (Anxiety Cognition Questionnaire (ACQ), Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ), Mobility Inventory (MI)) to check for a connection with infant development. The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III) were used to assess infant language and cognitive development at one year of age. SUBJECTS: n = 34 mothers with anxiety disorder (SCID-I; DSM-IV) and n = 47 healthy mothers with their infant. OUTCOME MEASURES: Infant performance on Bayley-III language and cognitive scales. RESULTS: Infants of mothers with anxiety disorder yielded significantly lower language scores than infants of controls. No significant group differences were found regarding infant cognitive development. Exploratory analyses revealed the vital role of ""maternal avoidance accompanied"" in infant language and cognitive development. Maternal neutral engagement, which lacks positive affect and vocalisations, turned out as the strongest negative predictor of cognitive development. Maternal anxiety cognitions and joint activity in mother-infant interaction were the strongest predictors of infant language performance.

Implicit Attitudes Toward Psychotherapy and Explicit Barriers to Accessing Psychotherapy in Youths and Parent-Youth Dyads,"Pfeiffer, S.; Huffer, A.; Feil, A.; In-Albon, T.","BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated implicit and explicit attitudes toward psychotherapy in youths (Study 1), although information about attitudes would improve interventions that aim to decrease barriers to accessing psychotherapy including parents (Study 2), who facilitate the help-seeking process of youths. METHOD: The Study 1 sample comprised 96 youths (14-21 years) and the Study 2 sample 38 parent-youth dyads. Differences in implicit attitudes regarding psychotherapy and a medical treatment were measured with the Implicit Association Test, and psychotherapy knowledge and self-reported barriers to psychotherapy were assessed with questionnaires. The actor-partner interdependence model was used to test the dyadic effects of implicit attitudes on explicit attitudes in parents and youths. RESULTS: We did not find evidence for an implicit bias toward psychotherapy compared to a medical treatment, neither in youths, nor in parents. Self-reported barriers were a predictor for lower help-seeking intentions. Deficits in psychotherapy knowledge were more relevant in younger participants. Having a prior or current experience with psychotherapy and having a friend or family member with a prior or current experience with psychotherapy were predictors for better psychotherapy knowledge, but was not for lower barriers to accessing psychotherapy. Partner effects (degree to which the individual's implicit attitudes are associated with explicit attitudes of the other dyad's member) were not found. CONCLUSION: Specific deficits in psychotherapy knowledge should be addressed in interventions to lower barriers accessing psychotherapy. Parents should be included in interventions as a valuable resource to support youths in seeking psychotherapy for mental disorders.",2022,Sep,Clin Psychol Eur,4,3,e7375,36398007.0,10.32872/cpe.7375,,#398,Pfeiffer 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
A comprehensive model of food addiction in patients with binge-eating symptomatology: The essential role of negative urgency,"Wolz, I.; Granero, R.; Fernandez-Aranda, F.","BACKGROUND: Food addiction has been widely researched in past years. However, there is a debate on the mechanisms underlying addictive eating and a better understanding of the processes associated to these behaviors is needed. Previous studies have found characteristic psychological correlates of food addiction, such as high negative urgency, emotion regulation difficulties and low self-directedness, in different samples of adults with addictive eating patterns. Still, it seems difficult to disentangle effects independent from general eating disorder psychopathology. Therefore, this study aimed to test a comprehensive model under control of eating disorder severity, in order to find independent predictors of food addiction. METHODS: 315 patients with eating disorder diagnoses on the binge-eating spectrum were assessed in personality, emotion regulation, negative urgency, eating disorder symptomatology, and food addiction by self-report. Hypothesis-driven structural equation modeling was conducted to test the comprehensive model. RESULTS: The only independent predictor found for food addiction was negative urgency, while self-directedness and emotion regulation predicted negative urgency and were highly related to eating disorder symptomatology, but not to food addiction. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether the model suggests that low self-directedness and difficulties in emotion regulation are related to higher eating disorder symptomatology in general. Those patients who, in addition to these traits, tend to act impulsively when in negative mood states, are at risk for developing addictive eating patterns. Urgency-based treatments are therefore recommended for this subgroup of patients.",2017,Apr,Compr Psychiatry,74,,118-124,28160693.0,10.1016/j.comppsych.2017.01.012,,#399,Wolz 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Stress reactivity in childhood functional abdominal pain or irritable bowel syndrome,"Gulewitsch, M. D.; Weimer, K.; Enck, P.; Schwille-Kiuntke, J.; Hautzinger, M.; Schlarb, A. A.","BACKGROUND: Frequent abdominal pain (AP) in childhood has been shown to be associated with elevated experience of stress and with deficits in stress coping, but psychophysiological stress reactivity has been studied rarely. METHODS: We examined whether children with frequent AP show altered reactions of the parasympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during and following an afternoon laboratory social stress task in comparison to healthy children and children with anxiety disorders. Twenty-four children with frequent AP (18 with functional AP and six with irritable bowel syndrome; M = 9.9 years), and 24 healthy controls underwent stressful free speech and arithmetic tasks. Twelve children with anxiety disorders served as second comparison sample. Groups were compared regarding parasympathetic reaction and saliva cortisol concentration. RESULTS: We found no differences in parasympathetic withdrawal between the groups. Concerning the HPA axis, we detected an attenuated cortisol reactivity in children with AP compared to both other groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that childhood AP is not associated with altered parasympathetic withdrawal during stress. It seems to be related to a down-regulated reactivity of the HPA axis. This pattern was ascertained in comparison to healthy children and also in comparison to children with anxiety disorders. SIGNIFICANCE: Childhood abdominal pain could be related to down-regulated HPA axis reactivity to stress but not to altered parasympathetic reaction. Children with abdominal pain and children with anxiety disorders exhibit a divergent stress-related HPA axis reaction.",2017,Jan,Eur J Pain,21,1,166-177,27470170.0,10.1002/ejp.914,,#400,Gulewitsch 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Distress criterion influences prevalence rates of functional gastrointestinal disorders,"Markert, C.; Suarez-Hitz, K.; Ehlert, U.; Nater, U. M.","BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) are defined by a combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms. Prevalence rates of FGID are high. Symptoms are associated with distress, and sufferers show high stress levels. However, the current diagnostic criteria do not consider subjective distress elicited by the symptoms, thus potentially leading to overestimated prevalence rates. The aim of this study was to explore the reduction in prevalence rates when distress is considered in the diagnostic criteria. METHODS: In this web-based study, FGID were diagnosed using the Rome II criteria. Prevalence rates with and without subjective distress elicited by the symptoms were computed. Additionally, stress levels and stress reactivity were assessed. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of FGID in our sample were similar to those in other studies. However, when considering the distress criterion, on average, a decrease of 38.51% was found in the prevalence rates of FGID. Sufferers who were subjectively distressed by their symptoms reported significantly higher stress levels than non-distressed subjects (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The consideration of a criterion of subjective distress in the diagnosis of FGID has consequences for actual prevalence rates of FGID. Distressed subjects differ markedly from non-distressed subjects in terms of their stress levels. The inclusion of a distress criterion in the ongoing development of diagnostic criteria for FGID is therefore warranted.",2014,Dec 18,BMC Gastroenterol,14,1,215,25518853.0,10.1186/s12876-014-0215-9,,#401,Markert 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Trauma, attentional dysregulation, and the development of posttraumatic stress: An investigation of risk pathways","Schafer, J.; Zvielli, A.; Hofler, M.; Wittchen, H. U.; Bernstein, A.","BACKGROUND: Fundamental questions regarding the nature and function of attentional bias (AB) to threat in the etiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remain unanswered. We tested the temporal interplay between trauma exposure, dysregulated attentional processing of threatening information pre- and post-trauma, and the development of posttraumatic intrusions. METHODS: Response time to trauma-related threat, trauma-unrelated threat, as well as to trauma-related but typically emotionally-neutral stimuli was assessed using the dot probe task before and one week after watching a violent movie scene that served as a trauma analogue. AB was analyzed as a dynamic process by means of a recently developed approach indexing momentary fluctuations of AB toward and away from emotional stimuli. Posttraumatic intrusions were measured daily over the week following analogue trauma exposure. RESULTS: We found that key features of AB dynamics to trauma-related stimuli at post-, but not pre-, trauma exposure were associated with posttraumatic intrusions. Notably, these post-trauma exposure effects were specific to biased attentional processing of trauma-related but not threatening stimuli unrelated to the traumatic event. In line with a growing body of findings, pre- and post-trauma exposure traditional aggregated mean AB scores were not similarly associated with posttraumatic intrusions. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that one mechanism through which trauma exposure may contribute to the development of PTSD is through its dysregulation of attentional processing of trauma event-related cues. Future work may focus on delineating the developmental course through which attentional dysregulation post-trauma and posttraumatic intrusions unfold and interact.",2018,Mar,Behav Res Ther,102,,60-66,29353159.0,10.1016/j.brat.2018.01.004,,#402,Schafer 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Separating generalized anxiety disorder from major depression using clinical, hormonal, and structural MRI data: A multimodal machine learning study","Hilbert, K.; Lueken, U.; Muehlhan, M.; Beesdo-Baum, K.","BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is difficult to recognize and hard to separate from major depression (MD) in clinical settings. Biomarkers might support diagnostic decisions. This study used machine learning on multimodal biobehavioral data from a sample of GAD, MD and healthy subjects to differentiate subjects with a disorder from healthy subjects (case-classification) and to differentiate GAD from MD (disorder-classification). METHODS: Subjects with GAD (n = 19), MD without GAD (n = 14), and healthy comparison subjects (n = 24) were included. The sample was matched regarding age, sex, handedness and education and free of psychopharmacological medication. Binary support vector machines were used within a nested leave-one-out cross-validation framework. Clinical questionnaires, cortisol release, gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) volumes were used as input data separately and in combination. RESULTS: Questionnaire data were well-suited for case-classification but not disorder-classification (accuracies: 96.40%, p < .001; 56.58%, p > .22). The opposite pattern was found for imaging data (case-classification GM/WM: 58.71%, p = .09/43.18%, p > .66; disorder-classification GM/WM: 68.05%, p = .034/58.27%, p > .15) and for cortisol data (38.02%, p = .84; 74.60%, p = .009). All data combined achieved 90.10% accuracy (p < .001) for case-classification and 67.46% accuracy (p = .0268) for disorder-classification. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous evidence, classification of GAD was difficult using clinical questionnaire data alone. Particularly cortisol and GM volume data were able to provide incremental value for the classification of GAD.

Internet-Based Cognitive-Behavioural Intervention for Women with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Weise, C.; Kaiser, G.; Janda, C.; Kues, J. N.; Andersson, G.; Strahler, J.; Kleinstauber, M.","BACKGROUND: Given the high prevalence of clinically relevant premenstrual symptoms and the associated impairment, there is a need for effective treatments. Initial evidence suggests cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The aim of the current randomized clinical trial was to evaluate an Internet-based CBT (iCBT) to reduce the burden of PMDD. METHODS: In all, 174 women with PMDD were recruited via newspaper articles, flyers, and social media. They were randomized to a treatment group (TG; n = 86) or waitlist control group (CG; n = 88). Women of the TG received an 8-week therapist-guided iCBT. Data were assessed before and after treatment/waiting, and 6 months after intervention with prospective symptom diaries and questionnaires in the premenstrual phase. Treatment effects and moderators were analysed using hierarchical linear modelling. RESULTS: Significant time x group interaction effects on functional impairment and psychological impairment, impact on everyday life, symptom intensity, and symptom disability in favour of the TG indicated the efficacy of the treatment. Follow-up assessments demonstrated treatment effects to be stable until 6 months after treatment. Additionally, significant interactions with moderator variables were found. In the TG, higher levels of active coping and lower levels of support-seeking coping were associated with stronger improvement in interference in everyday life and symptom intensity. In addition, lower levels of perceived stress were associated with stronger improvement in functional impairment. CONCLUSION: The iCBT was highly effective in reducing the burden of PMDD.

Blending group-based psychoeducation with a smartphone intervention for the reduction of depressive symptoms: results of a randomized controlled pilot study,"Lukas, C. A.; Berking, M.","BACKGROUND: Given their ubiquity and technological facilities, smartphone-based interventions (SBIs) hold potential to support the cost-effective dissemination of evidence-based treatments for depression. As technologically enriched, blended approach-avoidance modification trainings (AAMTs) have recently been shown effective for symptom reduction in various mental health problems, we developed a blended SBI combining group-based psychoeducation and 14 days of app training utilizing principles from AAMT to reduce depressive symptoms. METHODS: In this pilot trial, N = 16 individuals with heightened depression scores were randomized to either an intervention group using the mentalis Phoenix app or a wait list control condition. As outcomes, we descriptively explored usability of the app, engagement with the intervention, and possible reductions of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Data analyses suggest that the SBI tested in this pilot trial possesses high usability, is frequently engaged with, and reduces depressive symptoms in participants in the intervention group when compared to wait list controls.

Predominant attention allocation to illness-related information is regarded as a central process in the development and maintenance of HA, yet little is known about the neuronal correlates of this attentional bias. METHODS: An emotional Stroop task with body symptom, illness, and neutral words was employed to elicit emotional interference in healthy participants with high (HA+, n = 12) and low (HA-, n = 12) HA during functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Prolonged reaction times for indicating the color of symptom words and a decrease in rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) activation were seen in HA+ participants. Emotional interference effects on the behavioral level were negatively related to rACC activity over the whole group. Groups did not differ during the processing of threatening illness words. CONCLUSION: The results indicate stronger attention allocation toward body symptom words already in subclinical HA. This attentional bias appears to be linked to hypoactivity of the rACC which impedes effective emotional interference reduction, leading instead to a ruminative processing of the stimulus content.",2013,,Neuropsychobiology,67,2,93-102,23296017.0,10.1159/000345545,,#407,Witthoft 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Increased impulsivity as a vulnerability marker for bipolar disorder: evidence from self-report and experimental measures in two high-risk populations,"Wessa, M.; Kollmann, B.; Linke, J.; Schonfelder, S.; Kanske, P.","BACKGROUND: Heightened impulsivity has been suggested as a possible risk factor for bipolar disorder (BD). However, studies on high-risk populations are scarce and have mainly focused on individuals with a genetic risk. The present study investigated two high-risk samples for BD with regard to several aspects of the impulsivity construct. METHODS: Unaffected relatives of BD patients (genetically defined high-risk group, N=29) and participants scoring high on the Hypomanic Personality Scale (psychometrically defined high-risk sample, N=25) were being compared to respective control groups (N=27 and N=25) using a multi-method approach. Participants were accessed on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11, trait impulsivity), the Stop Signal Task (response inhibition), and the Cambridge Gambling Task (impulsive behavior in decision-making processes). RESULTS: Both high-risk groups reported heightened impulsivity on the BIS-11, as well as impulsive decision-making, whereas no significant group differences in response inhibition were observed. LIMITATIONS: Limitations were the lack in specificity of the results for BD and the cross-sectional study design, which does not allow conclusions about the influence of impulsivity on the development of or resilience for BD in risk groups.

Reward-related decision making and long-term weight loss maintenance,"Brockmeyer, T.; Simon, J. J.; Becker, A.; Friederich, H. C.","BACKGROUND: Heightened sensitivity towards reward and insensitivity towards disadvantageous consequences may constitute a driving factor underlying unrestricted food intake and consequent weight gain in people with overweight and obesity. Therefore, the present study applied a behavioral economics approach to investigate the potential contribution of poor reward-related decision making to unsuccessful long-term weight loss maintenance (i.e. weight cycling). Based on previous research, it was expected that successful long-term weight loss maintainers would show a better performance in a gambling task than their less successful counterparts. METHODS: Reward-related decision making was assessed post hoc using the Game of Dice Task in a total of 33 overweight and obese women who had either (a) successfully maintained initial weight loss of at least 10% of their body weight over one year or (b) had regained weight until at least their initial body weight prior to weight reduction (i.e. showed weight cycling). RESULTS: The groups did not differ in terms of age, current body weight, magnitude of initial weight reduction, educational level, and global intelligence level. As hypothesized, however, the group of successful long-term weight loss maintainers performed significantly better (i.e. showed less impulsive, more advantageous choices) in the Game of Dice Task than their less successful counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that poor reward-related decision making is associated with weight cycling which is considered a key concern in weight loss treatments for overweight and obesity.

We investigated performance monitoring in OCD with simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals to determine the neural source of the enhanced ERN. METHODS: Concurrent EEG and fMRI data were collected from 20 patients with OCD and 22 healthy control subjects during a flanker task. Independent component analysis was used separately on EEG and fMRI to segment the data functionally and focus on processes of interest. The ERN, hemodynamic responses following errors, and intraindividual correlation of the ERN and blood oxygen level-dependent activity were compared between groups. RESULTS: Patients with OCD showed significantly increased ERN amplitudes. Blood oxygen level-dependent activity in midcingulate cortex was not significantly different between groups. Increased activation of the right amygdala and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex following errors was observed in patients with OCD. Increased intraindividual correlation of the ERN and activity of the presupplementary motor area was found in patients with OCD compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Higher error-related activity was found in the amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting a stronger affective response toward errors in patients with OCD. Additionally, increased correlation of the ERN and presupplementary motor area may indicate stronger recruitment of proactive control in OCD.",2016,Oct 1,Biol Psychiatry,80,7,562-71,25659234.0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.12.010,,#410,Grutzmann 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Alpha-2 Adrenoreceptor Antagonist Yohimbine Potentiates Consolidation of Conditioned Fear,"Sperl, M. F. J.; Panitz, C.; Skoluda, N.; Nater, U. M.; Pizzagalli, D. A.; Hermann, C.; Mueller, E. M.","BACKGROUND: Hyperconsolidation of aversive associations and poor extinction learning have been hypothesized to be crucial in the acquisition of pathological fear. Previous animal and human research points to the potential role of the catecholaminergic system, particularly noradrenaline and dopamine, in acquiring emotional memories. Here, we investigated in a between-participants design with 3 groups whether the noradrenergic alpha-2 adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine and the dopaminergic D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride modulate long-term fear conditioning and extinction in humans. METHODS: Fifty-five healthy male students were recruited. The final sample consisted of n = 51 participants who were explicitly aware of the contingencies between conditioned stimuli (CS) and unconditioned stimuli after fear acquisition. The participants were then randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups and received either yohimbine (10 mg, n = 17), sulpiride (200 mg, n = 16), or placebo (n = 18) between fear acquisition and extinction. Recall of conditioned (non-extinguished CS+ vs CS-) and extinguished fear (extinguished CS+ vs CS-) was assessed 1 day later, and a 64-channel electroencephalogram was recorded. RESULTS: The yohimbine group showed increased salivary alpha-amylase activity, confirming a successful manipulation of central noradrenergic release. Elevated fear-conditioned bradycardia and larger differential amplitudes of the N170 and late positive potential components in the event-related brain potential indicated that yohimbine treatment (compared with a placebo and sulpiride) enhanced fear recall during day 2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that yohimbine potentiates cardiac and central electrophysiological signatures of fear memory consolidation. They thereby elucidate the key role of noradrenaline in strengthening the consolidation of conditioned fear associations, which may be a key mechanism in the etiology of fear-related disorders.",2022,Sep 28,Int J Neuropsychopharmacol,25,9,759-773,35748393.0,10.1093/ijnp/pyac038,,#411,Sperl 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Response of young patients with probable ICD-11 complex PTSD to treatment with developmentally adapted cognitive processing therapy,"Eilers, R.; Rimane, E.; Vogel, A.; Renneberg, B.; Steil, R.; Rosner, R.","Background: ICD-11 features Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) as a new diagnosis. To date, very few studies have investigated CPTSD in young patients, and there is a need for evidence on effective treatment. Objective: The present study evaluates the applicability of developmentally adapted cognitive processing therapy (D-CPT) for CPTSD in young patients in a secondary analysis of the treatment condition of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy of D-CPT. Methods: The D-CPT treatment group in the original study included 44 patients (14-21 years) with DSM-IV PTSD after childhood abuse. We used the ICD-11 algorithm to divide the sample into a probable CPTSD and a non-CPTSD group. We performed multilevel models for interviewer-rated and self-rated PTSD symptoms with fixed effects of group (CPTSD, non-CPTSD) and time (up to 12 months follow-up) and their interaction. Treatment response rates for both groups were calculated. Results: Nineteen (43.2%) patients fulfilled criteria for probable ICD-11 CPTSD while 25 (56.8%) did not. Both CPTSD and non-CPTSD groups showed symptom reduction over time. The CPTSD group reported higher symptom severity before and after treatment. Linear improvement and treatment response rates were similar for both groups. D-CPT reduced symptoms of disturbances in self-regulation in both groups. Discussion: Both, patients with and without probable ICD-11 CPTSD seemed to benefit from D-CPT and the treatment also reduced disturbances in self-regulation. Conclusion: This study presents initial evidence of the applicability of D-CPT in clinical practice for young patients with CPTSD. It remains debatable whether CPTSD implies different treatment needs as opposed to PTSD.",2021,2021/01/01,Eur J Psychotraumatol,12,1,1929024,34262664.0,10.1080/20008198.2021.1929024,,#412,Eilers 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Lifestyle choices and mental health: a representative population survey,"Velten, J.; Lavallee, K. L.; Scholten, S.; Meyer, A. H.; Zhang, X. C.; Schneider, S.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: Identifying healthy lifestyle behaviours that promote psychological wellbeing is crucial to preventing mental disorders. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the individual and combined associations between different aspects of everyday life and mental health within a representative community sample in Germany. METHOD: The study was conducted in 2012/2013 and included 7,937 participants representative of the German population. Lifestyle factors were assessed via self-report and included frequency of physical and mental activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index as well as circadian and social regularity. Outcome variables were depression, anxiety, stress and satisfaction with life. RESULTS: All lifestyle factors were associated with the mental health outcomes. Better mental health was linked to higher frequency of physical and mental activity, moderate alcohol consumption (i.e. not increased or no alcohol consumption), non-smoking, a body mass index within the range of normal to overweight (i.e. not underweight or obese) and a regular life rhythm. The more healthy lifestyle choices an individual makes, the higher life satisfaction and lower psychological distress he or she tends to have.

Long-term effects of imaginal retraining in overweight and obesity: A controlled study,"Gehlenborg, J.; Goritz, A. S.; Moritz, S.; Kuhn, S.","BACKGROUND: Imaginal retraining (IR) is a self-help technique that targets automatic approach tendencies toward appetitive stimuli. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT; N = 384), IR reduced craving for high-calorie foods after a six-week intervention period (small effect). The aim of the present study was to evaluate long-term effects of IR in this sample. METHODS: One year after baseline, participants from the initial RCT were recontacted. A visual analogue scale measuring craving, the Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait-reduced (FCQ-T-r), the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, quality of life, and subjective appraisal of the intervention were assessed online. Participants were classified as users or nonusers based on self-reported usage of IR over the previous year. RESULTS: Linear-mixed models showed no significant interaction effects of time and group for any outcome (trend level effects were found for two subscales of the FCQ-T-r). Yet, higher usage of IR was associated with greater symptom reduction. Although overall subjective appraisal of the intervention was comparably good to the initial study, usage of IR and completion rate were unsatisfactory. LIMITATIONS: Main limitations of the present study include the nonrandomized group allocation and the low completion rate. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find evidence for the long-term efficacy of IR in individuals with craving for high-calorie foods. Only upon high usage of IR, improvement was found. However, low completion rate and usage of the intervention may have resulted in a Type-II error. Future studies may consider low-intensity professional guidance to increase adherence and assess the long-term effects of IR in RCTs.",2023,Mar,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,78,,101794,36435539.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2022.101794,,#414,Gehlenborg 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
What Are Reasons for the Large Gender Differences in the Lethality of Suicidal Acts? An Epidemiological Analysis in Four European Countries,"Mergl, R.; Koburger, N.; Heinrichs, K.; Szekely, A.; Toth, M. D.; Coyne, J.; Quintao, S.; Arensman, E.; Coffey, C.; Maxwell, M.; Varnik, A.; van Audenhove, C.; McDaid, D.; Sarchiapone, M.; Schmidtke, A.; Genz, A.; Gusmao, R.; Hegerl, U.","BACKGROUND: In Europe, men have lower rates of attempted suicide compared to women and at the same time a higher rate of completed suicides, indicating major gender differences in lethality of suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study was to analyse the extent to which these gender differences in lethality can be explained by factors such as choice of more lethal methods or lethality differences within the same suicide method or age. In addition, we explored gender differences in the intentionality of suicide attempts. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Methods. Design: Epidemiological study using a combination of self-report and official data. Setting: Mental health care services in four European countries: Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal. Data basis: Completed suicides derived from official statistics for each country (767 acts, 74.4% male) and assessed suicide attempts excluding habitual intentional self-harm (8,175 acts, 43.2% male). Main Outcome Measures and Data Analysis. We collected data on suicidal acts in eight regions of four European countries participating in the EU-funded ""OSPI-Europe""-project (www.ospi-europe.com). We calculated method-specific lethality using the number of completed suicides per method * 100 / (number of completed suicides per method + number of attempted suicides per method). We tested gender differences in the distribution of suicidal acts for significance by using the chi2-test for two-by-two tables. We assessed the effect sizes with phi coefficients (phi). We identified predictors of lethality with a binary logistic regression analysis. Poisson regression analysis examined the contribution of choice of methods and method-specific lethality to gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. FINDINGS MAIN RESULTS: Suicidal acts (fatal and non-fatal) were 3.4 times more lethal in men than in women (lethality 13.91% (regarding 4106 suicidal acts) versus 4.05% (regarding 4836 suicidal acts)), the difference being significant for the methods hanging, jumping, moving objects, sharp objects and poisoning by substances other than drugs. Median age at time of suicidal behaviour (35-44 years) did not differ between males and females. The overall gender difference in lethality of suicidal behaviour was explained by males choosing more lethal suicide methods (odds ratio (OR) = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.65 to 2.50; p < 0.000001) and additionally, but to a lesser degree, by a higher lethality of suicidal acts for males even within the same method (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.32 to 2.02; p = 0.000005). Results of a regression analysis revealed neither age nor country differences were significant predictors for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. The proportion of serious suicide attempts among all non-fatal suicidal acts with known intentionality (NFSAi) was significantly higher in men (57.1%; 1,207 of 2,115 NFSAi) than in women (48.6%; 1,508 of 3,100 NFSAi) (chi2 = 35.74; p < 0.000001). MAIN LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY: Due to restrictive data security regulations to ensure anonymity in Ireland, specific ages could not be provided because of the relatively low absolute numbers of suicide in the Irish intervention and control region. Therefore, analyses of the interaction between gender and age could only be conducted for three of the four countries. Attempted suicides were assessed for patients presenting to emergency departments or treated in hospitals. An unknown rate of attempted suicides remained undetected. This may have caused an overestimation of the lethality of certain methods. Moreover, the detection of attempted suicides and the registration of completed suicides might have differed across the four countries. Some suicides might be hidden and misclassified as undetermined deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Men more often used highly lethal methods in suicidal behaviour, but there was also a higher method-specific lethality which together explained the large gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts. Gender differences in the lethality of suicidal acts were fairly consistent across all four European countries examined. Males and females did not differ in age at time of suicidal behaviour. Suicide attempts by males were rated as being more serious independent of the method used, with the exceptions of attempted hanging, suggesting gender differences in intentionality associated with suicidal behaviour. These findings contribute to understanding of the spectrum of reasons for gender differences in the lethality of suicidal behaviour and should inform the development of gender specific strategies for suicide prevention.",2015,2015/07/06,PLOS ONE,10,7,e0129062,26147965.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0129062,,#416,Mergl 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The role of KIBRA in reconstructive episodic memory,"Zlomuzica, A.; Preusser, F.; Roberts, S.; Woud, M. L.; Lester, K. J.; Dere, E.; Eley, T. C.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: In order to retrieve episodic past events, the missing information needs to be reconstructed using information stored in semantic memory. Failures in these reconstructive processes are expressed as false memories. KIBRA single nucleotide polymorphism (rs17070145) has been linked to episodic memory performance as well as an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Here, the role of KIBRA rs17070145 polymorphism (male and female CC vs. CT/TT carriers) in reconstructive episodic memory in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm was investigated in N = 219 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Female participants outperformed males in the free recall condition. Furthermore, a trend towards a gender x genotype interaction was found for false recognition rates. Female CT/TT carriers exhibited a lower proportion of false recognition rates for associated critical lures as compared to male CT/TT. Additionally, an association between KIBRA rs17070145 genotype, familiarity and recollection based recognition performance was found. In trials with correct recognition of listed items CT/TT carriers showed more ""remember"", but fewer ""know"" responses as compared to CC carriers. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the T-allele of KIBRA rs17070145 supports recollection based episodic memory retrieval and contributes to memory accuracy in a gender dependent manner. Findings are discussed in the context of the specific contribution of KIBRA related SNPs to reconstructive episodic memory and its implications for cognitive and emotional symptoms in dementia and PTSD.",2018,Mar 15,Mol Med,24,1,7,30134813.0,10.1186/s10020-018-0007-8,,#418,Zlomuzica 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
The posttraumatic stress interview for children (KID-PIN): development and validation of a semi-structured interview of PTSD symptoms among displaced children in the Middle East,"Ibrahim, H.; Catani, C.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND: In populations affected by mass disaster such as armed conflict and displacement, children are at risk of developing mental ill-health, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Valid and reliable screening instruments are needed to assess the severity of PTSD symptoms among children and to identify individuals in need of treatment. METHOD: In the context of an ongoing war in the Middle East, we developed the KID-PIN as a semi-structured interview for PTSD symptoms that can be administered by trained paraprofessionals. To achieve a culturally and contextually appropriate instrument, the development was based on open-ended interviews with affected children and involved both local and international experts. Using the KID-PIN and instruments for constructs associated with PTSD, 332 Iraqi and Syrian displaced children were interviewed. A subset of the sample (n = 86) participated in validation interviews based on experts applying the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5-Child/Adolescent Version (CAPS-CA-5). RESULTS: The KID-PIN demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94) with good convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analyses of the KID-PIN showed an acceptable fit with the DSM-5 and other common models; the best fit was reached with the Hybrid model. Receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated that the cut-off score of 28 or higher on the KID-PIN is the optimum cut-off for a probable PTSD diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The utility of the newly developed KID-PIN as a screening instrument for PTSD in children is supported by the measure's high internal consistency and good convergent and structural validity, as well as its diagnostic accuracy.",2021,2021/12/15,PeerJ,9,,e12403,35003912.0,10.7717/peerj.12403,,#419,Ibrahim 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Web-based psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in war-traumatized Arab patients: randomized controlled trial,"Knaevelsrud, C.; Brand, J.; Lange, A.; Ruwaard, J.; Wagner, B.","BACKGROUND: In recent years, armed conflicts in the Middle East have resulted in high rates of exposure to traumatic events. Despite the increasing demand of mental health care provision, ongoing violence limits conventional approaches of mental health care provision. Internet-based interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have proved feasible and effective in Western countries, but their applicability and efficacy in war and conflict regions remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral Internet-based intervention for war-traumatized Arab patients, with focus on Iraq. METHODS: A total of 159 individuals with PTSD participated in a parallel group randomized trial. Participants were randomly allocated by a computer-generated sequence to a treatment group (n=79) or a waiting list control group (n=80). The treatment group received 2 weekly 45-minute cognitive behavioral interventions via Internet over a 5-week period (10 sessions in total). The primary outcome was recovery from posttraumatic stress symptoms. RESULTS: Posttraumatic stress symptoms were significantly reduced from baseline to posttreatment (intention-to-treat analysis) in the treatment group relative to the control group (F1,157=44.29, P<.001, d=0.92). Treatment effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up. Completer analysis indicated that 29 of 47 patients (62%) in the treatment group had recovered from posttraumatic stress symptoms at posttreatment (reliable change and Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale score <20) versus 1 patient (2%) in the control group (OR 74.19, 95% CI 9.93-585.8, P<.001) indicating that the chance of recovering was 74.19 times higher in the treatment than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate, even in unstable and insecure settings with ongoing exposure to human rights violations through war and dictatorships, people with posttraumatic stress symptoms benefit from a cognitive behavioral treatment provided entirely through the Internet. This method of delivery could improve patients' access to humanitarian aid in the form of e-mental health services.

"Putative juvenile terrorists: the relationship between multiple traumatization, mental health, and expectations for reintegration among Islamic State recruited adolescent and young adult fighters","Mohammed, R.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND: In several conflicts worldwide children are recruited as fighters in irregular forces. These children need to be reintegrated into the society after the conflict. However, concurrent to various reservations in the communities, the reintegration of former child soldiers is challenged by the fact that many of the affected children were indoctrinated by the armed group and traumatized through war events. Even several years after the defeat of the terrorist organization ISIS in Iraq, systematic efforts towards the reintegration of children who had been recruited by ISIS are notably absent. METHODS: we conducted clinical interviews with a sample of N = 59 adolescents and young adults who were incarcerated for terrorism in the prisons of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq to assess levels and types of trauma exposure, PTSD, depression, readiness to reintegrate and ongoing identification with ISIS. RESULTS: We found high levels of PTSD and depression that were associated with trauma exposure. The subjective readiness to reintegrate into the communities was associated with trauma exposure and was mediated by depression, even after controlling for the influence of ongoing identification with the armed group. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that trauma-related mental ill-health should be considered in efforts to reintegrate young former terrorists.",2022,Nov 10,Confl Health,16,1,58,36357892.0,10.1186/s13031-022-00489-3,,#422,Mohammed 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Aggression inoculates against PTSD symptom severity-insights from armed groups in the eastern DR Congo,"Hecker, T.; Hermenau, K.; Maedl, A.; Schauer, M.; Elbert, T.","BACKGROUND: In the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), combatants are exposed to massive forms of violence and other traumatic stressors. Nevertheless, many combatants do not suffer from trauma-related disorders, although they have experienced numerous traumatizing events. Perceiving aggressive behavior as fascinating and arousing might be a defense against trauma-related disorders in the violent environment of war and conflict. OBJECTIVE: Thus, in this study we investigated the relationship between the exposure to traumatic stressors, appetitive aggression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity. We hypothesized that cumulative traumatic experiences correlated positively and appetitive aggression negatively with PTSD symptom severity. METHOD: In total, 105 voluntary male combatants from different armed groups in the eastern DRC took part in this study. In a semistructured interview, respondents were questioned about their exposure to traumatic stressors, the extent of appetitive aggression (Appetitive Aggression Scale) and their PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Symptom Scale - Interview). RESULTS: A multiple sequential regression analysis showed that traumatic events were positively related to PTSD symptom severity. For participants with low to medium PTSD symptom severity, appetitive aggression correlated negatively with PTSD symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide further support for earlier findings that repeated exposure to traumatic stressors cumulatively heightens the risk of PTSD and revealed that appetitive aggression buffers the risk of developing PTSD symptoms under certain circumstances. Thus, the perception of aggressive behavior as fascinating and arousing seem to help combatants to adapt to violent environments but may also be one reason for recurrent failure of reintegration programs for excombatants.",2013,2013/05/13,Eur J Psychotraumatol,4,1,,23671766.0,10.3402/ejpt.v4i0.20070,,#423,Hecker 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
How negative mood hinders belief updating in depression: results from two experimental studies,"Kube, T.; Kirchner, L.; Gartner, T.; Glombiewski, J. A.","BACKGROUND: In two experimental studies, we tested the hypothesis that negative mood would hinder the revision of negative beliefs in response to unexpectedly positive information in depression, whereas positive mood was expected to enhance belief updating. METHODS: In study 1 (N = 101), we used a subclinical sample to compare the film-based induction of sad v. happy mood with a distraction control group. Subsequently, participants underwent a well-established paradigm to examine intra-individual changes in performance-related expectations after unexpectedly positive performance feedback. In study 2, we applied the belief-updating task from study 1 to an inpatient sample (N = 81) and induced sad v. happy mood via film-clips v. recall of autobiographic events. RESULTS: The results of study 1 showed no significant group differences in belief updating; the severity of depressive symptoms was a negative predictor of belief revision, though, and there was a non-significant trend suggesting that the presence of sad mood hindered belief updating in the subgroup of participants with a diagnosed depressive episode. Study 2 revealed that participants updated their expectations significantly less in line with positive feedback when they underwent the induction of negative mood prior to feedback, relative to positive mood. CONCLUSIONS: By indicating that the presence of negative mood can hinder the revision of negative beliefs in clinically depressed people, our findings suggest that learning from new experiences can be hampered if state negative mood is activated. Thus, interventions relying on learning from novel positive experiences should aim at reducing state negative mood in depression.",2023,Mar,Psychol Med,53,4,1288-1301,34247664.0,10.1017/S0033291721002798,,#424,Kube 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Error-related brain activity as a transdiagnostic endophenotype for obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety and substance use disorder","Riesel, A.; Klawohn, J.; Grutzmann, R.; Kaufmann, C.; Heinzel, S.; Bey, K.; Lennertz, L.; Wagner, M.; Kathmann, N.","BACKGROUND: Increased neural error-signals have been observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, and inconsistently in depression. Reduced neural error-signals have been observed in substance use disorders (SUD). Thus, alterations in error-monitoring are proposed as a transdiagnostic endophenotype. To strengthen this notion, data from unaffected individuals with a family history for the respective disorders are needed. METHODS: The error-related negativity (ERN) as a neural indicator of error-monitoring was measured during a flanker task from 117 OCD patients, 50 unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients, and 130 healthy comparison participants. Family history information indicated, that 76 healthy controls were free of a family history for psychopathology, whereas the remaining had first-degree relatives with depression (n = 28), anxiety (n = 27), and/or SUD (n = 27). RESULTS: Increased ERN amplitudes were found in OCD patients and unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients. In addition, unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with anxiety disorders were also characterized by increased ERN amplitudes, whereas relatives of individuals with SUD showed reduced amplitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in neural error-signals in unaffected first-degree relatives with a family history of OCD, anxiety, or SUD support the utility of the ERN as a transdiagnostic endophenotype. Reduced neural error-signals may indicate vulnerability for under-controlled behavior and risk for substance use, whereas a harm- or error-avoidant response style and vulnerability for OCD and anxiety appears to be associated with increased ERN.

Increased Anxiety of Public Situations During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From a Community and a Patient Sample,"Pittig, A.; Gluck, V. M.; Boschet, J. M.; Wong, A. H. K.; Engelke, P.","BACKGROUND: Increases in emotional distress in response to the global outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic have been reported. So far, little is known about how anxiety responses in specific everyday public life situations have been affected. METHOD: Self-reported anxiety in selected public situations, which are relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic, was investigated in non-representative samples from the community (n = 352) and patients undergoing psychotherapy (n = 228). Situational anxiety in each situation was rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = no anxiety at all to 4 = very strong anxiety). Situational anxiety during the pandemic was compared with retrospectively reported situational anxiety before the pandemic (direct change) and with anxiety levels in a matched sample assessed before the pandemic (n = 100; indirect change). RESULTS: In the community and patient sample, indirect and direct change analyses demonstrated an increase in anxiety in relevant public situations but not in control situations. Average anxiety levels during the pandemic were moderate, but 5-28% of participants reported high to very high levels of anxiety in specific situations. Interestingly, the direct increase in anxiety levels was higher in the community sample: patients reported higher anxiety levels than the community sample before, but not during the pandemic. Finally, a higher increase in situational anxiety was associated with a higher perceived danger of COVID-19, a higher perceived likelihood of contracting COVID-19, and stronger symptoms of general anxiety and stress. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings demonstrate an increase in anxiety in public situations during the COVID-19 pandemic in a community and a patient sample. Moderate anxiety may facilitate compliance with public safety measures.

Error-Related Brain Activity in Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Unaffected First-Degree Relatives: Evidence for Protective Patterns,"Grutzmann, R.; Kaufmann, C.; Wudarczyk, O. A.; Balzus, L.; Klawohn, J.; Riesel, A.; Bey, K.; Wagner, M.; Heinzel, S.; Kathmann, N.","BACKGROUND: Indicators of increased error monitoring are associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as shown in electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. As most studies used strictly controlled samples (excluding comorbidity and medication), it remains open whether these findings extend to naturalistic settings. Thus, we assessed error-related brain activity in a large, naturalistic OCD sample. We also explored which activity patterns might qualify as vulnerability endophenotypes or protective factors for the disorder. To this aim, a sample of unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with OCD was also included. METHODS: Participants (84 patients with OCD, 99 healthy control participants, and 37 unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with OCD) completed a flanker task while blood oxygen level-dependent responses were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Aberrant error-related brain activity in patients and relatives was identified. RESULTS: Patients with OCD showed increased error-related activity in the supplementary motor area and within the default mode network, specifically in the precuneus and postcentral gyrus. Unaffected first-degree relatives showed increased error-related activity in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Increased supplementary motor area and default mode network activity in patients with OCD replicates previous studies and might indicate excessive error signals and increased self-referential error processing.

Real-life self-control conflicts in anorexia nervosa: An ecological momentary assessment investigation,"Furtjes, S.; Seidel, M.; Diestel, S.; Wolff, M.; King, J. A.; Hellerhoff, I.; Bernadoni, F.; Gramatke, K.; Goschke, T.; Roessner, V.; Ehrlich, S.","BACKGROUND: Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) are often thought to show heightened self-control and increased ability to inhibit desires. In addition to inhibitory self-control, antecedent-focused strategies (e.g., cognitive reconstrual-the re-evaluation of tempting situations) might contribute to disorder maintenance and enable disorder-typical, maladaptive behaviors. METHODS: Over a period of 14 days, 40 acutely underweight young female patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and 40 healthy control (HC) participants reported their affect and behavior in self-control situations via ecological momentary assessment during inpatient treatment (AN) and everyday life (HC). Data were analyzed via hierarchical analyses (linear and logistic modeling). RESULTS: Conflict strength had a significantly lower impact on self-control success in AN compared to HC. While AN and HC did not generally differ in the number or strength of self-control conflicts or in the percentage of self-control success, AN reported self-controlled behavior to be less dependent on conflict strength. CONCLUSIONS: While patients with AN were not generally more successful at self-control, they appeared to resolve self-control conflicts more effectively. These findings suggest that the magnitude of self-control conflicts has comparatively little impact on individuals with AN, possibly due to the use of antecedent-focused strategies. If confirmed, cognitive-behavioral therapy might focus on and help patients to exploit these alternative self-control strategies in the battle against their illness.",2022,Jun 16,Eur Psychiatry,65,1,e39,35707860.0,10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.29,,#430,Furtjes 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Taking a walk through time: aversive memory re-experiencing may be linked to spatio-temporal distance,"Meyer, T.; Nelson, J.; Morina, N.","BACKGROUND: Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often report intrusive memories that appear to lack the appropriate spatio-temporal context. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether focusing on the spatio-temporal context of aversive autobiographical memories reduces negative emotions, appraisals, and re-experiencing symptoms. METHODS: We recruited 109 healthy adults and had them rate emotionality, vividness, and re-experiencing of an aversive autobiographical memory. Furthermore, we assessed automatic associations of idiosyncratic memory triggers with the concepts 'past' vs. 'now', and self-reported sense of memory closure and distancing. To manipulate spatio-temporal memory (re-)organization, the experimental group (n = 53) performed a lifeline exercise in virtual reality (VR), where participants symbolically placed memory triggers along a path representing their own personal life story. The control group (n = 56) completed a non-personalized VR task. RESULTS: We found a marked decrease in negative emotions, negative appraisals, and re-experiencing in the following week, but on average, the lifeline exercise was not superior to the control condition. However, those in the lifeline group with stronger trigger-past associations subsequently exhibited a more pronounced reduction in re-experiencing. Also, participants with a higher subjective sense of memory distancing reported less re-experiencing. CONCLUSIONS: The findings lend tentative support for theoretical assumptions about PTSD, but the potential causal role of automatic associations with spatio-temporal information remains to be clarified.",2022,2021/12/22,Eur J Psychotraumatol,13,1,2003993,34992760.0,10.1080/20008198.2021.2003993,,#432,Meyer 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Working memory moderates the relation between the brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and psychotherapy outcome for depression,"Bruijniks, S. J. E.; van Grootheest, G.; Cuijpers, P.; de Kluiver, H.; Vinkers, C. H.; Peeters, F.; Penninx, B.; Teunissen, C. E.; Huibers, M. J. H.","BACKGROUND: Insight into patient characteristics that predict response to treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) may help to personalize treatment and improve outcomes. One mechanism that has been linked to the success of treatment for MDD is brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). BDNF is implicated in learning and memory and may play a role in the effects of psychotherapy that involves changing cognitions and behaviors. In addition, only in individuals with low BDNF, low working memory capacity has been associated with increased symptoms of depression. However, the role of BDNF and working memory capacity in psychotherapy outcome is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of BDNF and its interaction with working memory capacity in psychotherapy outcomes for MDD. METHOD: Adult patients with MDD were randomized to weekly or twice weekly sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy. BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) (n = 138) was defined and serum BDNF was quantified before (n = 138) and after psychotherapy (n = 82). RESULTS: Baseline serum BDNF and the Val66Met polymorphism were not associated with outcome and associations did not differ between treatment conditions. Working memory capacity significantly moderated the relation between baseline serum BDNF and outcome: high serum BDNF at baseline was related to less depressive symptoms following psychotherapy in the presence of high working memory capacity, but not low working memory capacity. DISCUSSION: These findings, if replicated, might indicate that while BDNF may not be related to psychotherapy outcomes in general, they may play a role in the presence of specific learning processes such as working memory capacity.",2020,Nov,J Psychiatr Res,130,,424-432,32891918.0,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.045,,#435,Bruijniks 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
External Validity of the Multicomponent Group Treatment KiSS for School-Aged Children With Insomnia,"Schwerdtle, B.; Kubler, A.; Schlarb, A.","Background: Insomnia is common in school-aged children and often associated with other mental disorders. Here, we investigated the effectiveness and acceptance of the KiSS program in an ""all-comer"" pediatric insomnia clinic. Participants/Methods: Forty-five families (children: 5-10 years, 57.8% female) were randomly assigned to the multicomponent six-session KiSS treatment (CBT-I, hypnotherapy, and imaginations) or a wait-list control group. A sleep diary was recorded before intervention or waiting time, immediately after, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months postintervention (primary outcome: sleep efficiency, SE; sleep-onset latency, SOL). Results: Sleep improved significantly after the KiSS intervention. Three to 12 months after the intervention, only 1.75% of treated children still met the diagnostic criteria for insomnia. SE improved to 96%, and both SOL (reduced to 23 min) and total sleep time were normalized. All improvements were stable for at least one year after the intervention. KiSS was well accepted (0% dropout during intervention) and well tolerated. Conclusions: Treatment with the multimodal sleep training KiSS leads to positive changes in the sleep of children with insomnia, including a subset of children that presented with comorbid mental disorders. With only three sessions for parents and three sessions for children, the treatment can be readily implemented as a stand-alone treatment or be combined with other interventions.

User Experience and Effects of an Individually Tailored Transdiagnostic Internet-Based and Mobile-Supported Intervention for Anxiety Disorders: Mixed-Methods Study,"Weisel, K. K.; Zarski, A. C.; Berger, T.; Krieger, T.; Moser, C. T.; Schaub, M. P.; Gorlich, D.; Berking, M.; Ebert, D. D.","BACKGROUND: Internet interventions have been shown to be effective in treating anxiety disorders. Most interventions to date focus on single disorders and disregard potential comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this mixed-methods study was to investigate feasibility, user experience, and effects of a newly developed individually tailored transdiagnostic guided internet intervention for anxiety disorders. METHODS: This study is an uncontrolled, within-group, baseline, postintervention pilot trial with an embedded qualitative and quantitative process and effect evaluation. In total, 49 adults with anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder n=20, social phobia n=19, agoraphobia without panic n=12, panic with agoraphobia n=6, panic without agoraphobia n=4, subclinical depression n=41) received access to the 7-session intervention. We examined motivation and expectations, intervention use, user experience, impact, and modification requests. Qualitative data were assessed using semistructured interviews and analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Quantitative outcomes included symptom severity of anxiety and depression (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A], Quick Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology clinician rating [QIDS-C]), diagnostic status in clinical interviews (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]), and web-based self-reports (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7], Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D], Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI], Panic and Agoraphobia Scale [PAS], Social Phobia Scale [SPS], Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at baseline and postassessment. Quantitative data was analyzed by comparing within-group means expressed as Cohen d. RESULTS: Anxiety symptom severity (HAM-A d=1.19) and depressive symptoms (QIDS-C d=0.42) improved significantly, and 54% (21/39) no longer were diagnosed as having any anxiety disorder. The main positive effects were the general improvement of disease burden and attentiveness to feelings and risk situations while the main negative effects experienced were lack of change in disease burden and symptom deterioration. The most prevalent reasons for participation were the advantages of online treatment, symptom burden, and openness toward online treatment. Helpful factors included support, psychoeducation and practicing strategies in daily life; the main hindering factors were too little individualization and being overwhelmed by the content and pace. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was found to be feasible and results show preliminary data indicating potential efficacy for improving anxiety and depression. The next step should be the evaluation within a randomized controlled trial. Concerning intervention development, it was found that future interventions should emphasize individualization even more in order to further improve the fit to individual characteristics, preferences, and needs.",2020,Sep 16,J Med Internet Res,22,9,e16450,32936085.0,10.2196/16450,,#438,Weisel 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Treating tinnitus distress via the Internet: A mixed methods approach of what makes patients seek help and stay motivated during Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy,"Heinrich, S.; Rozental, A.; Carlbring, P.; Andersson, G.; Cotter, K.; Weise, C.","BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) has proven to be an effective treatment in improving patients' ability to cope with tinnitus. However, some patients prefer face-to-face therapy to ICBT, and a few studies have shown considerable dropout rates if the treatment is not guided. This renders it important to identify factors that contribute to the commencement and continuation of ICBT programs. AIMS: Because treatment motivation and expectations are important factors in psychological treatment, the aim of our study was to investigate what leads tinnitus patients to seek out ICBT, what helps them to keep up with the treatment, and what (if any) impact these factors have on dropout rates and treatment outcomes. METHOD: 112 tinnitus patients taking part in ICBT for tinnitus responded to symptom-related questionnaires at three points in time (pre-treatment, post-treatment, and one-year-follow-up) and to a questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions about their treatment motivation and expectations before beginning treatment. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, and the results were used to divide the participants into groups. The treatment outcomes of these groups were compared using t-tests, chi(2)-tests, and both one-factorial and mixed ANOVAs. RESULTS: Four main categories emerged as factors conducive to starting treatment: 1) Targets participants wanted to address, 2) circumstances that led to participation, 3) attitudes towards the treatment, and 4) training features. Participants identified six facilitators for continuing the treatment: success, training, individual attitude, hope, evidence, and support. Naming specific tinnitus-associated problems as targets was associated with greater improvement from pre-treatment to 1-year-follow-up. Describing an active involvement in the treatment was related to increased improvement from post-treatment to follow-up. CONCLUSION: There are several motivational factors that tinnitus patients consider relevant for beginning and continuing ICBT. Particularly, focusing on specific targets that do not involve the tinnitus itself, and encouraging participants to take an active role in treatment may increase treatment effectiveness. However, further hypothesis-guided research is necessary to confirm our explorative results.",2016,May,Internet Interv,4,,120-130,30135798.0,10.1016/j.invent.2016.04.001,,#439,Heinrich 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Is only one cognitive technique also effective? Results from a randomized controlled trial of two different versions of an internet-based cognitive behavioural intervention for post-traumatic stress disorder in Arabic-speaking countries,"Bottche, M.; Wagner, B.; Vohringer, M.; Heinrich, M.; Stein, J.; Selmo, P.; Stammel, N.; Knaevelsrud, C.","BACKGROUND: Internet-based cognitive-behavioural interventions seem to be effective for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Arabic-speaking countries in the MENA region. However, due to high prevalence rates of trauma-related mental disorders in this region, it is important to scale up existing Internet-based interventions in order to increase the number of clients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine whether a brief Internet-based intervention with one cognitive technique (TF-short, 6 assignments) results in the same PTSD symptom change and lower dropouts compared to a longer intervention with two cognitive techniques (TF-reg, 10 assignments). METHOD: A total of 224 Arab participants (67.4% female; M = 25.3 years old) with PTSD were randomly assigned to Internet-based CBT with either a TF-reg protocol (n = 110) or a TF-short protocol (n = 114). Symptoms of PTSD and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, quality of life) were self-assessed online at baseline and post-treatment. Treatment-associated changes were estimated using multigroup latent difference score models. RESULTS: The overall PTSD score assessed with the PDS decreased by about 15 points in both conditions. The between-group differences (TF-reg vs. TF-short) at post-assessment were non-significant, Delta = 0.29, p = .896, d = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.30, 0.34]. Like the primary outcome, all within-group changes for the secondary outcomes throughout the intervention were statistically significant and all between-group effects were non-significant. Overall, the dropout rates did not differ between the two conditions, chi2 (1/N = 175) = 0.83, p = .364. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the shorter condition results in the same symptom change and dropout rate as the longer condition. This highlights the potential of shorter, more scalable Internet-based interventions in socially restricted and (post-)conflict societies.

Barriers to and Facilitators of Engaging With and Adhering to Guided Internet-Based Interventions for Depression Prevention and Reduction of Pain-Related Disability in Green Professions: Mixed Methods Study,"Braun, L.; Freund, J.; Thielecke, J.; Baumeister, H.; Ebert, D. D.; Titzler, I.","BACKGROUND: Internet-based interventions (IBIs) are effective for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders and are valuable additions for improving routine care. However, the uptake of and adherence to IBIs are often limited. To increase the actual use of IBIs, it is important to identify factors for engaging with and adhering to IBIs. OBJECTIVE: We qualitatively evaluated barriers and facilitators regarding a portfolio of guided IBIs in green professions (farmers, gardeners, and foresters). METHODS: Interview participants were selected from 2 randomized controlled trials for either the prevention of depression (Prevention of Depression in Agriculturists [PROD-A]) or the reduction of pain interference (Preventive Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Chronic Pain in Agriculturists [PACT-A]) in green professions. The intervention group in PROD-A (N=180) participated in an IBI program, receiving access to 1 of 6 symptom-tailored IBIs. The intervention group in PACT-A (N=44) received access to an IBI for chronic pain. Overall, 41 semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted and transcribed verbatim. Barriers and facilitators were identified via inductive qualitative content analysis, with 2 independent coders reaching almost perfect intercoder reliability (Cohen kappa=0.92). A quantitative follow-up survey (30/41, 73%) was conducted to validate the results. Subgroup analyses were performed based on intervention characteristics. RESULTS: We identified 42 barriers and 26 facilitators, which we assigned to 4 superordinate categories related to the intervention (20 barriers; 17 facilitators), work (4 barriers; 1 facilitator), individual (13 barriers; 8 facilitators), and technical (5 barriers; 0 facilitators) aspects. Key barriers (identified by at least 50% of the interviewees) were time-consuming work life (29/40, 73%) and time-consuming private life (23/40, 58%). Similarly, the most frequently identified facilitators included presence of motivation, curiosity, interest and perseverance (30/40, 75%), flexible time management at work (25/40, 63%), and support from family and friends (20/40, 50%). Although agreement with barriers in the quantitative follow-up survey was rather low (mean 24%, SD 11%), agreement with facilitators was substantially higher (mean 80%, SD 13%). Differences in agreement rates were found particularly between intervention completers and noncompleters. Completers agreed significantly more often that perceived IBI success; being motivated, curious, interested, and perseverant; and having a persisting level of psychological strain have been facilitating. Noncompleters agreed more often with experiencing the e-coach contact as insufficient and technical problems as hindering for intervention completion. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, strategies such as customization of modules for more flexible and adaptive use; video chat options with the e-coach; options to facilitate social support by family, friends, or other participants; or using prompts to facilitate training completion can be derived. These approaches could be evaluated in further quantitative research designs in terms of their potential to enhance intervention use in this occupational group.

"Listen to Your Heart-Ecological Momentary Assessment of Interoceptive Accuracy, Awareness and Sensibility: A Pilot Study","Holler, I.; Stenzel, J. S.; Rath, D.; Forkmann, T.","Background: Interoception is a multi-facetted phenomenon including interoceptive accuracy, awareness and sensibility. Deficits in interoception have been associated with psychological distress. However, little is known about the course of interoception over time. The present study aimed at examining interoception in an ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-setting. Methods: A seven-day smartphone-based EMA was conducted in a community sample of sixty-one participants (age: M = 24.1, SD = 7.00, n = 54 female (88.5%)). To control for potential practice effects of repeated assessments during the EMA phase, participants were randomly assigned to a control (n = 30) and an interoception (n = 31) group. The latter was assessed for interoceptive accuracy, awareness and sensibility. Before and after the EMA phase, all participants were assessed for interoception in the laboratory. Results: Multilevel analyses revealed significant fluctuations for all three interoceptive facets, around 50% of variance was due to within-person variability. There were only practice effects for the subscale ""Attention Regulation"", measuring interoceptive sensibility. Conclusion: The facets of interoception can be assessed in an EMA-setting. Repeated interoceptive assessments do not necessarily lead to an improvement of participants' interoceptive abilities. It could be shown that all interoceptive facets fluctuate, which should be considered in future research.",2021,May 4,Int J Environ Res Public Health,18,9,4893,34064438.0,10.3390/ijerph18094893,,#442,Holler 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Atypical Self-Focus Effect on Interoceptive Accuracy in Anorexia Nervosa,"Pollatos, O.; Herbert, B. M.; Berberich, G.; Zaudig, M.; Krauseneck, T.; Tsakiris, M.","Background: Interoceptive abilities are known to be affected in anorexia nervosa (AN). Previous studies could show that private self-focus can enhance interoceptive accuracy (IAcc) in healthy participants. As body dissatisfaction is high in AN, confrontation with bodily features such as the own face might have a directly opposed effect in AN. Whether patients with AN can benefit from self-focus in their IAcc and whether this pattern changes over the time-course of cognitive behavioral therapy was investigated in this study. Methods: Fifteen patients with AN from the Psychosomatic Clinic in Windach were assessed three times in the time course of a standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy. They were compared to 15 controls, recruited from Ulm University and tested in a comparable setting. Both groups performed the heartbeat perception task assessing IAcc under two conditions either enhancing (""Self"") or decreasing (""Other"") self-focused attention. Furthermore, body dissatisfaction was assessed by a subscale of the Eating Disorder (ED) Inventory 2. Results: Patients with AN scored higher in IAcc when watching others' faces as compared to one's own face while performing the heartbeat perception task. The opposite pattern was observed in controls. IAcc remained reduced in AN as compared to controls in the time-course of cognitive-behavioral therapy, while body-dissatisfaction improved in AN. High body dissatisfaction was related to poorer IAcc in the ""Self"" condition. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that using self-focused attention reduces IAcc in AN while the opposite pattern was observed in controls. Confronting anorexic patients with bodily features might increase body-related avoidance and therefore decrease IAcc. The current study introduces a new perspective concerning the role of interoceptive processes in AN and generates further questions regarding the therapeutic utility of methods targeting self-focus in the treatment of AN.",2016,2016/09/27,Front Hum Neurosci,10,,484,27729855.0,10.3389/fnhum.2016.00484,,#443,Pollatos 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The Effects of a Standardized Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy and an Additional Mindfulness-Based Training on Interoceptive Abilities in a Depressed Cohort,"Karanassios, G.; Schultchen, D.; Mohrle, M.; Berberich, G.; Pollatos, O.","BACKGROUND: Interoceptive accuracy and sensibility are decreased in depressive samples. However, different studies showed that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness interventions are promising approaches to improve interoceptive abilities. Based on these findings, the study aims to investigate the pre-post effect of CBT in a depressive sample. Additionally, we examined the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training in the context of CBT. METHODS: Sixty depressive patients were investigated over four weeks, with two conditions-CBT vs. CBT + MBSR. Further, the changes in interoceptive abilities (interoceptive accuracy and sensibility) of the depressive patients were compared to baseline data of healthy controls. RESULTS: The depressive patients showed significantly higher levels of depression and lower mindfulness and interoceptive abilities than healthy controls. The depressive sample showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and increased mindfulness and interoceptive abilities after CBT. Lastly, depressive patients of the CBT + MBSR condition did not differ from those who only received CBT in the levels of depression, mindfulness or interoceptive abilities over the time course. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a positive effect of CBT on interoceptive abilities in a depressive sample. It is shown that the depressive sample did not profit from additional mindfulness training. It can be concluded that CBT is an efficient treatment, resulting in increased interoceptive abilities. Unexpectedly, the combination of CBT and MBSR has no additional effect on these changes.

Sense it and use it: interoceptive accuracy and sensibility in suicide ideators,"Forkmann, T.; Volz-Sidiropoulou, E.; Helbing, T.; Druke, B.; Mainz, V.; Rath, D.; Gauggel, S.; Teismann, T.","BACKGROUND: Interoceptive deficits have been found to be associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. However, an objective measure of interoceptive accuracy has not been investigated in participants with suicide ideation, by now. This study aimed at investigating interoceptive accuracy and sensibility in persons with and without suicide ideation (SI) while controlling for severity of depressive symptoms. METHOD: Ninety-five participants (age: M = 34.8, SD = 11.6, n = 56 female [58.9%]; n = 51 patients with a Major Depressive Disorder and n = 44 healthy participants) were assessed for interoceptive accuracy and sensibility, depression and SI. RESULTS: Twenty-five participants (26%) reported SI. They showed interoceptive accuracy comparable to persons without SI (t = -.81, p = .422), but significantly lower interoceptive sensibility. After controlling for severity of depressive symptoms in a hierarchical linear regression analysis, most associations between interoceptive sensibility and SI disappeared. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that suicide ideators do not lack the ability to perceive their own bodily signals but they feel less able to use them in a way that is advantageous for them.

A comparison of interpreters' wellbeing and work-related characteristics in the care of refugees across different work settings,"Geiling, A.; Bottche, M.; Knaevelsrud, C.; Stammel, N.","BACKGROUND: Interpreters in the care of refugees work in various different settings. Qualitative studies suggest that interpreters are confronted with a variety of demands depending on the context in which they work, which may in turn influence their wellbeing. To date, no larger-scale study has investigated differences between work settings regarding interpreters' work-related characteristics or wellbeing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the work-related characteristics and possible changes in the wellbeing of interpreters between four main work settings (psychotherapy, counselling, medical setting, and authorities) in the care of refugees. METHOD: Interpreters in refugee care were recruited for a nationwide online survey in Germany with two measurement time points. Participants provided socio-demographic data and answered questions about the working conditions in their respective main work setting. In addition, psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI-18), work-related exhaustion (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, CBI), and compassion satisfaction (Professional Quality of Life, ProQOL) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 158 interpreters were included at t1, of whom 63 were also included at t2. Significantly more traumatic content was interpreted in counselling settings and psychotherapy than in medical and authorities settings (H (3) = 26.09, p < .001). The highest proportion of interpreters with an interpreting degree worked in the authorities setting (Fisher's exact test, p = .002). Significant differences between the four settings were found for psychological distress (Kruskal-Wallis-test, H (3) = 12.02, p = .01) and work-related exhaustion (Kruskal-Wallis-test, H (3) = 8.10, p = .04) but not for compassion satisfaction.

Seeing in the Mind's eye: Imagery rescripting for patients with body dysmorphic disorder. A single case series,"Ritter, V.; Stangier, U.","BACKGROUND: Intrusive images of appearance play an important role in the maintenance of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and are often linked to negative autobiographical experiences. However, to date there is no study examining the use and efficacy of imagery rescripting in BDD. METHOD: This study investigated imagery rescripting in six patients with BDD, using a single case series A-B design. The intervention consisted of two treatment sessions (T1, T2). BDD and depressive symptoms were evaluated prior to (T1), post (T2) and two weeks after intervention (FU), using the Yale -Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale for BDD (BDD-YBOCS), the Body Dysmorphic Symptoms Inventory, and the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: At post-treatment, significant reductions in negative affect, distress, vividness and encapsulated beliefs associated with images and memories as well as an increased control were observed for five of six patients. These were maintained or decreased at two weeks follow-up. Scores on the BDD-YBOCS indicated a significant 26% improvement in BDD severity at follow-up for the whole group. Considering response as a >/= 30% reduction in BDD-YBOCS score, four of six patients were classified as treatment responders. At follow-up, significant improvements in BDD and depressive symptoms were observed for the whole group. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size and the lack of a control group limit the generalizability of our results.

Mental imagery in adolescent PTSD patients after child abuse: a comparison with matched healthy controls,"Steil, R.; Fischer, A.; Gutermann, J.; Rosner, R.","BACKGROUND: Intrusive mental imagery (MI) plays a crucial role in the maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. Evidence on the characteristics of MI in adolescents suffering from PTSD is sparse. The aim of this study was to thoroughly assess MI in an adolescent sample suffering from PTSD after the experience of childhood sexual abuse and/or childhood physical abuse (CA). METHODS: Thirty-two adolescents with a primary diagnosis of PTSD after CA and 32 adolescents without any mental disorder and without a history of CA, matched for age and gender, completed questionnaires assessing the characteristics of negative and positive MI, as well as images of injury and death that lead to positive emotions (ID-images). RESULTS: The PTSD group reported significantly more frequent, more vivid, more distressing and more strongly autobiographically linked negative MI compared to the control group. Although positive MI was highly present in both groups (PTSD: 65.6%; controls: 71.9%), no significant differences emerged between the two groups regarding the distinct characteristics of positive MI. The frequency of the ID-images did not significantly differ between the two groups (PTSD: 21.9%; controls: 9.4%), although the ID-images were more vivid in the PTSD group. DISCUSSION: Negative MI appears to be crucial in adolescent PTSD, whilst positive MI are unexpectedly common in both the PTSD and the control group. The role of positive MI as well as that of ID-images remain unclear. Specific interventions for changing negative MI that are tailored to the developmental challenges in adolescents with PTSD should be developed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Some of the PTSD patients in this study were also part of a randomized controlled trial on Developmentally adapted Cognitive Processing Therapy (D-CPT).

"Drinking to ease the burden: a cross-sectional study on trauma, alcohol abuse and psychopathology in a post-conflict context","Ertl, V.; Saile, R.; Neuner, F.; Catani, C.","BACKGROUND: It is likely that alcohol use and abuse increase during and after violent conflicts. The most prominent explanation of this phenomenon has been referred to as self-medication hypothesis. It predicts that psychotropic substances are consumed to deal with conflict-related psychic strains and trauma. In northern Uganda, a region that has been affected by a devastating civil war and is characterized by high levels of alcohol abuse we examined the associations between war-trauma, childhood maltreatment and problems related to alcohol use. Deducing from the self-medication hypothesis we assumed alcohol consumption moderates the relationship between trauma-exposure and psychopathology. METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological survey targeting war-affected families in post-conflict northern Uganda included data of male (n = 304) and female (n = 365) guardians. We used standardized questionnaires in an interview format to collect data on the guardians' socio-demography, trauma-exposure, alcohol consumption and symptoms of alcohol abuse, PTSD and depression. RESULTS: Symptoms of current alcohol use disorders were present in 46 % of the male and 1 % of the female respondents. A multiple regression model revealed the unique contributions of emotional abuse in the families of origin and trauma experienced outside the family-context in the prediction of men's alcohol-related symptoms. We found that alcohol consumption moderated the dose-effect relationship between trauma-exposure and symptoms of depression and PTSD. Significant interactions indicated that men who reported more alcohol-related problems experienced less increase in symptoms of PTSD and depression with increasing trauma-exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The gradual attenuation of the dose-effect the more alcohol-related problems were reported is consistent with the self-medication hypothesis. Hence, the functionality of alcohol consumption has to be considered when designing and implementing addiction treatment in post-conflict contexts.",2016,Jun 24,BMC Psychiatry,16,1,202,27342048.0,10.1186/s12888-016-0905-7,,#449,Ertl 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

H.","BACKGROUND: It is unclear what session frequency is most effective in cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for depression. AIMS: Compare the effects of once weekly and twice weekly sessions of CBT and IPT for depression. METHOD: We conducted a multicentre randomised trial from November 2014 through December 2017. We recruited 200 adults with depression across nine specialised mental health centres in the Netherlands. This study used a 2 x 2 factorial design, randomising patients to once or twice weekly sessions of CBT or IPT over 16-24 weeks, up to a maximum of 20 sessions. Main outcome measures were depression severity, measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II at baseline, before session 1, and 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months after start of the intervention. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Compared with patients who received weekly sessions, patients who received twice weekly sessions showed a statistically significant decrease in depressive symptoms (estimated mean difference between weekly and twice weekly sessions at month 6: 3.85 points, difference in effect size d = 0.55), lower attrition rates (n = 16 compared with n = 32) and an increased rate of response (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% CI 1.00-2.18).

The significance of job-anxiety in a working population,"Muschalla, B.; Heldmann, M.; Fay, D.","BACKGROUND: Job-anxiety, as distinguished from trait-anxiety, is associated with long-term sickness absence. The prevalence of job-anxiety within a working population is not known. Identifying individuals who would benefit from intervention might be useful. AIMS: To investigate job-anxiety in employees not undergoing treatment for mental health illness, firstly by assessing the level of job-anxiety and work-related avoidance tendencies in a working sample, and secondly by testing whether job-anxiety is distinguishable from trait-anxiety. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample obtained through personal contact distribution. Employees from different professional settings completed an anonymous questionnaire and provided information on their employment status. The State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) was used to measure trait-anxiety and the Job-Anxiety-Scale (JAS) was used to assess job (state) anxiety. RESULTS: There was a 69% response rate (240 responses); 188 responses were available for analysis of whom 62% were women. There were no employees with high trait-anxiety. Ten employees (5%) reported increased job-anxiety and of these nine employees reported high 'tendencies of avoidance and workplace absence'. Avoidance was most often accompanied by the comorbid job-anxieties 'job-related social anxiety', 'fear of changes at work' and 'fears of existence', 'anticipatory' and 'conditioned' job-anxiety and 'panic symptoms'. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, self-reported job-anxiety appeared as a specific type of anxiety as opposed to trait-anxiety. In the workplace job-anxiety can present as job-avoidance and sickness absence and should be distinguished from trait-anxiety. In practice, employers and occupational health practitioners should be aware of those employees prone to sickness absence.",2013,Sep,Occup Med (Lond),63,6,415-21,23771887.0,10.1093/occmed/kqt072,,#451,Muschalla 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Tracking Stress, Mental Health, and Resilience Factors in Medical Students Before, During, and After a Stress-Inducing Exam Period: Protocol and Proof-of-Principle Analyses for the RESIST Cohort Study","Fritz, J.; Stochl, J.; Kievit, R. A.; van Harmelen, A. L.; Wilkinson, P. O.","BACKGROUND: Knowledge of mental distress and resilience factors over the time span from before to after a stressor is important to be able to leverage the most promising resilience factors and promote mental health at the right time. To shed light on this topic, we designed the RESIST (Resilience Study) study, in which we assessed medical students before, during, and after their yearly exam period. Exam time is generally a period of notable stress among medical students, and it has been suggested that exam time triggers mental distress. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to describe the study protocol and to examine whether the exam period indeed induces higher perceived stress and mental distress. We also aim to explore whether perceived stress and mental distress coevolve in response to exams. METHODS: RESIST is a cohort study in which exam stress functions as a within-subject natural stress manipulation. In this paper, we outline the sample (N=451), procedure, assessed measures (including demographics, perceived stress, mental distress, 13 resilience factors, and adversity), and ethical considerations. Moreover, we conducted a series of latent growth models and bivariate latent change score models to analyze perceived stress and mental distress changes over the 3 time points. RESULTS: We found that perceived stress and mental distress increased from the time before the exams to the exam period and decreased after the exams to a lower level than before the exams. Our findings further suggest that higher mental distress before exams increased the risk of developing more perceived stress during exams. Higher perceived stress during exams, in turn, increased the risk of experiencing a less successful (or quick) recovery of mental distress after exams. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, the exam period caused a temporary increase in perceived stress and mental distress. Therefore, the RESIST study lends itself well to exploring resilience factors in response to naturally occurring exam stress. Such knowledge will eventually help researchers to find out which resilience factors lend themselves best as prevention targets and which lend themselves best as treatment targets for the mitigation of mental health problems that are triggered or accelerated by natural exam stress. The findings from the RESIST study may therefore inform student support services, mental health services, and resilience theory.",2021,Jun 8,JMIR Form Res,5,6,e20128,34100761.0,10.2196/20128,,#452,Fritz 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Wealth, justice and freedom: Objective and subjective measures predicting poor mental health in a study across eight countries","Scholten, S.; Velten, J.; Neher, T.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: Macro-level factors (MF) such as wealth, justice and freedom measured with objective country-level indicators (objective MF), for instance the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), have been investigated in relation to health and well-being, but rarely in connection with depression, anxiety and stress subsumed as poor mental health. Also, a combination of different objective MF and of how individuals perceive those MF (subjective MF) has not been taken into consideration. In the present study, we combined subjective and objective measures of wealth, justice and freedom and examined their relationship with poor mental health. METHOD: Population-based interviews were conducted in France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K. and U.S.A. (n approximately 1000 per country). GDP, GINI coefficient, Justice Index and Freedom Index were used as objective MF, whereas subjective MF were perceived wealth, justice and freedom measured at the individual level. Poor mental health was assessed as a combination of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. RESULTS: In a random-intercept-model, GINI coefficient and Freedom Index were significant positive country-level, and perceived wealth, justice, and freedom significant negative individual-level predictors of symptoms of poor mental health. CONCLUSION: Multiple subjective and objective MF should be combined to assess the macrosystem's relationship with poor mental health more precisely. The relationship between MF and poor mental health indicates that the macrosystem should be taken into account as relevant context for mental health problems, too.",2017,Dec,SSM Popul Health,3,,639-648,29349252.0,10.1016/j.ssmph.2017.07.010,,#453,Scholten 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Effectiveness of guided internet-based interventions in the indicated prevention of depression in green professions (PROD-A): Results of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Braun, L.; Titzler, I.; Terhorst, Y.; Freund, J.; Thielecke, J.; Ebert, D. D.; Baumeister, H.","BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has a major impact on public health. Reduction of depression burden in general population is of greatest importance and might be achieved by implementation of depression prevention measures into routine care. We evaluate an online prevention measure as part of a national project aiming to reduce depression in the occupational group of green professions. METHODS: This two-armed pragmatic RCT (n = 360) evaluates the effectiveness of a tailored internet-based intervention (IMI) program compared to enhanced treatment as usual. The IMI program entailed access to one of six guided IMIs each focusing on different symptom areas (depressive mood with optional comorbid diabetes, perceived stress, insomnia, panic and agoraphobia and harmful alcohol consumption). Eligible were entrepreneurs, spouses, family members and pensioners in green professions with adequate insurance status and at least subthreshold depression (PHQ>/=5). Primary outcome was depressive symptom severity (QIDS-SR16) at 9-weeks post-treatment (T1). Various secondary outcomes were assessed at T1. RESULTS: A small effect of depression reduction (d=-0.28, 95%-CI: -0.50 to -0.07) was found at T1 favouring the IMI program (beta=-0.22, 95%-CI: -0.41 to -0.02, p=.033). Categorical analysis indicated a reduced risk of potential MDD with NNTB=28.11. Adherence to the IMI program at T1 was exceptionally low. LIMITATIONS: Results are limited to green professions and representativeness might be restricted by self-selection of participants. CONCLUSION: Depression burden in green professions can be reduced by this online prevention measure. Yet, short-term effectiveness is restricted by low adherence rates.

Cognitive and affective trait and state factors influencing the long-term symptom course in remitted depressed patients,"Timm, C.; Ubl, B.; Zamoscik, V.; Ebner-Priemer, U.; Reinhard, I.; Huffziger, S.; Kirsch, P.; Kuehner, C.","BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a high risk for relapses and chronic developments. Clinical characteristics such as residual symptoms have been shown to negatively affect the long-term course of MDD. However, it is unclear so far how trait repetitive negative thinking (RNT) as well as cognitive and affective momentary states, the latter experienced during daily-life, affect the long-term course of MDD. METHOD: We followed up 57 remitted depressed (rMDD) individuals six (T2) and 36 (T3) months after baseline. Clinical outcomes were time to relapse, time spent with significant symptoms as a marker of chronicity, and levels of depressive symptoms at T2 and T3. Predictors assessed at baseline included residual symptoms and trait RNT. Furthermore, momentary daily life affect and momentary rumination, and their variation over the day were assessed at baseline using ambulatory assessment (AA). RESULTS: In multiple models, residual symptoms and instability of daily-life affect at baseline independently predicted a faster time to relapse, while chronicity was significantly predicted by trait RNT. Multilevel models revealed that depressive symptom levels during follow-up were predicted by baseline residual symptom levels and by instability of daily-life rumination. Both instability features were linked to a higher number of anamnestic MDD episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that trait RNT, but also affective and cognitive processes during daily life impact the longer-term course of MDD. Future longitudinal research on the role of respective AA-phenotypes as potential transdiagnostic course-modifiers is warranted.",2017,2017/06/02,PLOS ONE,12,6,e0178759,28575049.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0178759,,#457,Timm 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Barriers and Facilitators for Referrals of Primary Care Patients to Blended Internet-Based Psychotherapy for Depression: Mixed Methods Study of General Practitioners' Views,"Titzler, I.; Berking, M.; Schlicker, S.; Riper, H.; Ebert, D. D.","BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and often managed by general practitioners (GPs). GPs mostly prescribe medication and show low referral rates to psychotherapy. Many patients remain untreated. Blended psychotherapy (bPT) combines internet-based interventions with face-to-face psychotherapy and could increase treatment access and availability. Effectively implementing bPT in routine care requires an understanding of professional users' perspectives and behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators perceived by GPs in referring patients to bPT. Explanations for variations in referral rates were examined. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 of 110 GPs participating in a German randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate barriers to and facilitators for referrals to bPT for MDD (10 web-based modules, app-based assessments, and 6 face-to-face sessions). The interview guide was based on the theoretical domains framework. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and the qualitative content was analyzed by 2 independent coders (intercoder agreement, k=0.71). A follow-up survey with 12 interviewed GPs enabled the validation of emergent themes. The differences in the barriers and facilitators identified between groups with different characteristics (eg, GPs with high or low referral rates) were described. Correlations between referrals and characteristics, self-rated competences, and experiences managing depression of the RCT-GPs (n=76) were conducted. RESULTS: GPs referred few patients to bPT, although varied in their referral rates, and interviewees referred more than twice as many patients as RCT-GPs (interview-GPs: mean 6.34, SD 9.42; RCT-GPs: mean 2.65, SD 3.92). A negative correlation was found between GPs' referrals and their self-rated pharmacotherapeutic competence, r(73)=-0.31, P<.001. The qualitative findings revealed a total of 19 barriers (B) and 29 facilitators (F), at the levels of GP (B=4 and F=11), patient (B=11 and F=9), GP practice (B=1 and F=3), and sociopolitical circumstances (B=3 and F=6). Key barriers stated by all interviewed GPs included ""little knowledge about internet-based interventions"" and ""patients' lack of familiarity with technology/internet/media"" (number of statements, each k=22). Key facilitators were ""perceived patient suitability, e.g. well-educated, young"" (k=22) and ""no conflict with GP's role"" (k=16). The follow-up survey showed a very high agreement rate of at least 75% for 71% (34/48) of the identified themes. Descriptive findings indicated differences between GPs with low and high referral rates in terms of which and how many barriers (low: mean 9.75, SD 1.83; high: mean 10.50, SD 2.38) and facilitators (low: mean 18.25, SD 4.13; high: mean 21.00; SD 3.92) they mentioned. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into factors influencing GPs' referrals to bPT as gatekeepers to depression care. Barriers and facilitators should be considered when designing implementation strategies to enhance referral rates. The findings should be interpreted with care because of the small and self-selected sample and low response rates.",2020,Aug 18,JMIR Ment Health,7,8,e18642,32673213.0,10.2196/18642,,#458,Titzler 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

The purpose of this study was to examine the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the German version of the Counselor Activity Self-Efficacy Scales-Revised (CASES-R). Method: The sample consisted of 670 German psychotherapy trainees, who completed an online survey. We examined the factor structure by applying exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to the instrument as a whole. Results: A bifactor-exploratory structural equation modeling model with one general and five specific factors provided the best fit to the data. Omega hierarchical coefficients indicated optimal reliability for the general factor, acceptable reliability for the Action Skills-Revised (AS-R) factor, and insufficient estimates for the remaining factors. The CASES-R scales yielded significant correlations with related measures, but also with therapeutic orientations. Conclusion: We found support for the reliability and validity of the German CASES-R.

Turning Good Intentions Into Actions by Using the Health Action Process Approach to Predict Adherence to Internet-Based Depression Prevention: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Zarski, A. C.; Berking, M.; Reis, D.; Lehr, D.; Buntrock, C.; Schwarzer, R.; Ebert, D. D.","BACKGROUND: Many individuals engaging in Internet-based interventions fail to complete these treatments as intended. The processes responsible for treatment adherence in Internet-based interventions are still poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent adherence in an Internet-based intervention can be predicted by motivational and volitional factors outlined in the health action process approach (HAPA). METHODS: This study investigated motivational and volitional factors included in HAPA in a randomized controlled trial to predict treatment adherence of N=101 individuals with subclinical depression in the intervention group of a depression prevention intervention (GET.ON Mood Enhancer). Adherence was operationalized as the number of completed treatment modules. Using longitudinal structural equation modeling, HAPA variables (motivational, maintenance, and recovery self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, intention, and planning) were assessed at baseline and their associations with adherence 7 weeks later. RESULTS: Planning predicted adherence. Better planning was, in turn, associated with higher levels of maintenance self-efficacy, and the latter significantly affected treatment adherence via planning. The other hypothesized direct associations were not significant. In total, the HAPA variables accounted for 14% of variance in treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Planning emerged as the strongest predictor of treatment adherence in highly motivated participants in an Internet-based intervention out of all HAPA variables investigated. Findings are in line with the hypothesis that planning facilitates the translation of good intentions into actions. The findings imply that systematically fostering planning skills and maintenance self-efficacy prior to or during Internet-based interventions would help participants to successfully complete these treatments.

Comparison of two neonatal pain assessment tools (Children and Infant's Postoperative Pain Scale and the Neonatal Facial Coding System-Revised) and their relations to clinicians' intuitive pain estimates,"Kappesser, J.; de Laffolie, J.; Faas, D.; Ehrhardt, H.; Hermann, C.","BACKGROUND: Many neonatal observational pain assessment tools are available. Their application in clinical settings, however, has been limited. A further difficulty for decision makers may be to choose among the variety of available tools the appropriate one(s) for their patients. Aims of the present study were (1) to compare two commonly cited neonatal pain assessment tools, the Neonatal Facial Coding System-Revised (NFCS-R) and the Children and Infant's Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS), with regard to their psychometric qualities and (2) to explore intuitive clinicians' ratings by relating them to the tools' items. METHODS: Three coders applied both pain assessment tools to videos of 44 neonates who were videotaped while undergoing a painful and a stressful procedure. Clinicians rated the pain neonates experienced on a numerical rating scale. Analyses of variances and regression analyses were used to investigate whether tools could discriminate between the procedures and whether tools' items were predictors of intuitive clinicians' ratings. RESULTS: Interrater reliability, internal consistency and relative convergent validity were high for both assessment tools. Both tools discriminated between painful and stressful situations equally well. Roughly one third of variance in clinicians' intuitive ratings could be explained by items of each tool, however, no single item was found to be a significant predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Both pain assessment tools performed equally well regarding psychometric comparisons. Therefore, clinical utility needs to be considered when having to choose. Possibilities of improvement for both tools were identified. Cues clinicians base their intuitive pain judgements need to be further investigated. SIGNIFICANCE: Psychometric comparisons of neonatal assessment tools provide useful information that can help health care professionals to choose among tools and researchers to improve them. Both tools compared here performed psychometrically equally well. Their clinical utility, however, can be improved, for example by providing a manual (CHIPPS) and training opportunities.",2019,Apr,Eur J Pain,23,4,708-718,30407684.0,10.1002/ejp.1338,,#462,Kappesser 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Sustainability of effects and secondary long-term outcomes: One-year follow-up of a cluster-randomized controlled trial to prevent maltreatment in institutional care,"Hecker, T.; Mkinga, G.; Hartmann, E.; Nkuba, M.; Hermenau, K.","BACKGROUND: Many orphans in East Africa are living in institutional care facilities where they experience poor quality of care and ongoing maltreatment. We report on the extension of a cluster-randomized controlled trial aiming to replicate and show sustainability of previous found effects and to discover long-term effects of the intervention Interaction Competencies with Children-for Caregivers (ICC-C) 12-months after the intervention's conclusion. METHODS: Conducting a robust 2x3 analysis of variance, we investigated the changes over time in the waitlist orphanages (n = 75, 62.7% female, Mage = 37.63 years, SDage = 11.81), which participated in the intervention after first follow-up and in the initial intervention orphanages (n = 81, 61.7% female, Mage = 38.73 years, SDage = 11.94). RESULTS: The caregivers in the waitlist orphanages reported less reported levels of maltreatment (d = -0.09), fewer positive attitudes towards violent discipline (d = -0.44) and increased childcare knowledge (d = 1.26) three months after intervention, replicating our findings of the initial intervention condition. In addition, these effects were maintained in the intervention orphanages 12 months post intervention. Furthermore, we found long-term improvements in negative caregiver-child relationship (d = -0.83), caregivers' stress level (d = -0.98) and their mental health problems (d = -0.61). CONCLUSIONS: The replication and maintenance of the intervention effects and first hints to additional long-term effects substantiates the effectiveness of ICC-C. As long as alternative care cannot be provided for all children in need, brief caregiver trainings can make an important contribution to enlarge the opportunities for many children.

Physical exercise training as preceding treatment to cognitive behavioral therapy in mild to moderate major depressive disorder: A randomized controlled trial,"Heinzel, S.; Schwefel, M.; Sanchez, A.; Heinen, D.; Fehm, L.; Henze, R.; Teran, C.; Kallies, G.; Rapp, M. A.; Fydrich, T.; Strohle, A.; Heissel, A.","BACKGROUND: Many patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) remain untreated or do not respond to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Physical exercise shows antidepressive effects and may serve as an effective augmentation treatment. However, research on combining exercise with CBT is sparse in MDD and underlying mechanisms of exercise are not well understood to date. METHODS: 120 outpatients with MDD were randomized to either a high intensity exercise group (HEX), a low intensity exercise group (LEX), or a waiting list control group (WL). After 12 weeks of exercise training or waiting period, all patients received a manualized CBT. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients with MDD completed both the exercise program/ waiting period and the CBT. While physical fitness improved in HEX after the exercise program, it did not change in LEX and WL. Depressive symptoms improved in all three groups from baseline to post-CBT and the group by time interaction was not significant. Regression analyses revealed that the amount of fitness improvement during exercise predicted the subsequent CBT response. LIMITATIONS: The dropout rate was relatively high, preparatory CBT sessions during exercise / waiting period may have influenced depressive symptoms, and no patients with severe MDD were included. CONCLUSIONS: High intense physical exercise did not lead to a general enhancement of CBT outcome, but higher increases in physical fitness seem to improve symptom change during CBT.

"Individual changes in stress, depression, anxiety, pathological worry, posttraumatic stress, and health anxiety from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults from Southeastern Germany","Wechsler, T. F.; Schmidmeier, M.; Biehl, S.; Gerczuk, J.; Guerrero-Cerda, F. M.; Muhlberger, A.","BACKGROUND: Many studies have previously compared the prevalence or sample means of distress and mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, while results on changes at the individual-level, and regarding multiple outcome measures are demanded. METHODS: This online study investigated individual changes in stress and mental health from before the COVID-19 pandemic to the first lockdown in adults from Southeastern Germany. This region was selected as it was where SARS-CoV-2 was first documented in Germany, and also due to the implementation of strict stay-at-home orders and social contact prohibitions. From April 10-27, 2020, we collected state measures and their clinical relevance for the subareas of perceived stress: worries, tension, joy, and demands. We also collected information regarding the following mental health problems: depression, anxiety, pathological worry, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and health anxiety; as well as retrospective measures of how participants felt they have changed in comparison to before the pandemic, ranging from worse to better. RESULTS: The analytical sample comprised 396 adult participants. On average, participants experienced increases in worries, tension, and lack of joy, and increases in mental health problems, but a decrease in demands. Perceived increases in symptoms of depression (26.0%) and PTSD (25.5%) were significantly more frequent than in symptoms of anxiety (particularly acute fear and panic) (5.6%), pathological worry (9.8%), and health anxiety (7.3%) (ps<.001). One per 10 participants (10.4%) reported an increase in depressive symptoms, and nearly two per 10 (18.4%) an increase in PTSD symptoms and additionally showed a clinically relevant symptom strain during lockdown. Interestingly, mainly non-specific PTSD symptoms associated with a general stress reaction were experienced to be increased. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a dissociation of perceived changes in subareas of stress and mental health with a particular experience of increases in depressive and general stress symptoms and a decrease in external demands. This points to a need for a more differentiated view on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress and mental health, and for targeted interventions for mental health problems arising frequently during the pandemic.",2022,Aug 5,BMC Psychiatry,22,1,528,35927707.0,10.1186/s12888-022-04148-y,,#467,Wechsler 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Intergenerational Transmission of Internalizing Behavior: The Role of Maternal Psychopathology, Child Responsiveness and Maternal Attachment Style Insecurity","Reck, C.; Nonnenmacher, N.; Zietlow, A. L.","BACKGROUND: Maternal depression and anxiety disorders are risk factors for the development of internalizing disorders in offspring. Maternal attachment has been discussed as one factor accounting for transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate child internalizing behavior at preschool age on a symptomatic and behavioral level and possible links to maternal mental health over time and maternal attachment style insecurity in a sample of postpartum depressed and anxious mothers. SAMPLING AND METHODS: Child internalizing behavior at preschool age was rated by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form (C-TRF), and during a mother-child free-play situation. We focused on child responsiveness as it has been linked to child internalizing behavior. Maternal attachment style insecurity was tested to mediate the link between maternal mental health (assessed postpartum and at preschool age with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders, SCID-I) and child internalizing behavior/child responsiveness. Of the overall sample (n = 58), 28 women were diagnosed with postpartum depression and/or anxiety disorders according to DSM-IV, and 30 were healthy controls. Data were collected 3-9 months after delivery and at preschool age (mean = 4.6 years). RESULTS: At preschool age, children of postpartum depressed and anxious mothers were rated significantly higher on child internalizing behavior by mothers, fathers, and additional caregivers compared to the control group. Child internalizing behavior rated by mothers was influenced by current psychiatric symptoms; maternal attachment style insecurity did not mediate this link. During interaction, children in the clinical group displayed significantly less child responsiveness compared to the control group. Maternal attachment style insecurity mediated the relationship between maternal mental health over time and child responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the need for interventions focusing on mother-child interaction and maternal attachment.",2016,,Psychopathology,49,4,277-284,27399847.0,10.1159/000446846,,#468,Reck 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Examining differences in cognitive and affective theory of mind between persons with high and low extent of somatic symptoms: an experimental study,"Preis, M. A.; Golm, D.; Kroner-Herwig, B.; Barke, A.","BACKGROUND: Medically unexplained somatic symptoms are common, associated with disability and strongly related to depression and anxiety disorders. One interesting, but to date rarely tested, hypothesis is that deficits in both theory of mind (ToM) and emotional awareness may undergird the phenomenon of somatization. This study sought to investigate whether or not differences in ToM functioning and self-reported emotional awareness are associated with somatic symptoms in a sample from the general population. METHODS: The sample consisted of 50 healthy participants (37 females, 13 males) aged between 22 and 64 years (46.8 +/- 11.7) of whom 29 reported a high extent of somatic symptoms (HSR), whereas 21 reported a low extent of somatic symptoms (LSR) based on the 30 highest and lowest percentiles of the Symptom List norms. The participants' affective and cognitive ToM were assessed with two experimental paradigms by experimenters who were blind to the participants' group membership. In addition, self-reports regarding emotional awareness, alexithymia, depressive and anxiety symptoms and current affect were collected. RESULTS: In the experimental tasks, HSR showed lower affective ToM than LSR but the groups did not differ in cognitive ToM. Although HSR reported lower emotional awareness than LSR in the self-report measure, this group difference vanished when we controlled for anxiety and depression. Depression, anxiety, emotional awareness and alexithymia were correlated positively. CONCLUSIONS: The data supported the hypothesis that deficits in affective ToM are related to somatic symptoms. Neither cognitive ToM nor self-reported emotional awareness were associated with somatic symptoms. Self-reported emotional awareness, alexithymia and symptoms of depression and anxiety shared a considerable amount of variance.",2017,May 30,BMC Psychiatry,17,1,200,28558727.0,10.1186/s12888-017-1360-9,,#469,Preis 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The latent structure of medically unexplained symptoms and its relation to functional somatic syndromes,"Witthoft, M.; Hiller, W.; Loch, N.; Jasper, F.","BACKGROUND: Medically unexplained symptoms are the hallmark of somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes. PURPOSE: Although medically unexplained symptoms represent a common phenomenon both in the general population as well as in medical settings, the exact latent structure of somatic symptoms remains largely unclear. METHOD: We examined the latent structure of medically unexplained symptoms by means of the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) questionnaire (i.e., a popular symptom checklist) and provide support for the construct validity of our model. The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis in a general population sample (study 1; N = 414) and in a sample of primary care patients (study 2; N = 308). We compared four different latent structure models of medically unexplained symptoms: a general factor model, a correlated group factor model, a hierarchical model, and a bifactor model. RESULTS: In study 1, a bifactor model with one general factor and four independent specific symptom factors (i.e., gastrointestinal, pain, fatigue, and cardiopulmonary symptoms) showed the best model fit. This bifactor model was confirmed in the primary care sample (study 2). Additionally, the model explained 59 % of the variance of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this structural equation model, both the general factor (14 %) as well as the gastrointestinal symptom factor (42 %) significantly predicted the IBS. CONCLUSION: The findings of both studies help to clarify the latent structure of somatic symptoms in the PHQ-15. The bifactor model outperformed alternative models and demonstrated external validity in predicting IBS.",2013,Jun,Int J Behav Med,20,2,172-83,22618306.0,10.1007/s12529-012-9237-2,,#470,Witthoft 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Persistence and course of mental health problems from childhood into adolescence: results of a 10-year longitudinal study,"Supke, M.; Ferling, C.; Hahlweg, K.; Schulz, W.","BACKGROUND: Mental health problems (MHP) in children and adolescents (CA) are common. This longitudinal study analyzed the prevalence, course, and persistence of MHP over 10 years from childhood into adolescence based on a sample from the Future Family project (N = 230). METHODS: At the pre-assessment point the children were on average 5 (SE = 1) and the mothers 35 (SE = 5) years old. Descriptive methods, Chi(2)-tests, binary logistic regression, and different analytical approaches (number chains, transition probability) were used. RESULTS: Approximately 24% of the CA suffered from borderline clinical or clinically relevant MHP. The largest proportion of the sample was stable healthy (70%), whereas 15% of the CA showed chronic mentally ill, 8% transient, 4% negative and 4% positive courses. The mental health of the mother proved to be a decisive predictor for chronic mentally ill courses. Short-term persistence rates ranged between 60 and 70% from one assessment point to the next one. On the other hand, long-term persistence rates (from childhood into adolescence) were lower (51-59%). CONCLUSION: One in seven children in this sample suffered from chronic MHP, while only one third of the CA in Germany with clinically relevant MHP take advantage of psychological or psychiatric care. Prevention programs should be considered as an effective and economic approach to reduce childhood suffering in Germany.",2021,Feb 27,BMC Psychol,9,1,38,33640034.0,10.1186/s40359-021-00535-4,,#474,Supke 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Effectiveness of an Internet- and App-Based Intervention for College Students With Elevated Stress: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Harrer, M.; Adam, S. H.; Fleischmann, R. J.; Baumeister, H.; Auerbach, R.; Bruffaerts, R.; Cuijpers, P.; Kessler, R. C.; Berking, M.; Lehr, D.; Ebert, D. D.","BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are highly prevalent among college students. Most students with poor mental health, however, do not receive professional help. Internet-based self-help formats may increase the utilization of treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based, app-supported stress management intervention for college students. METHODS: College students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4-item version, PSS-4 >/=8) were randomly assigned to either an internet- and mobile-based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group. Self-report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS-4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college-related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale >17). RESULTS: A total of 106 participants (76.8%) indicated that they were first-time help-seekers, and 77.3% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95% CI 0.36-1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95% CI 0.43-1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95% CI 0.30-0.96), college-related productivity (d=0.33; 95% CI 0.01-0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95% CI 0.01-0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment). Response rates for stress symptoms were significantly higher for the intervention group (69%, 52/75) compared with the waitlist control group (35%, 26/75, P<.001; number needed to treat=2.89, 95% CI 2.01-5.08) at posttest (7 weeks). Effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up, and similar findings emerged in students with symptoms of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Internet- and mobile-based interventions could be an effective and cost-effective approach to reduce consequences of college-related stress and might potentially attract students with clinically relevant depression who would not otherwise seek help.

Language barriers often prevent timely access to appropriate health care, leading to chronic trajectories and abortive social integration. Tools for multilingual screening and assessment could be of great benefit for this particularly vulnerable population as well as for policy makers. This study aimed at testing the reliability, feasibility and usability of the Multi-Adaptive Psychological Screening Software (MAPSS), a newly developed Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview Software (ACASI) for touchscreen devices, for screening purposes in a clinical setting. METHODS: In a randomized cross-over design including both MAPSS and paper-pencil clinician-administered interviews, 30 treatment-seeking refugees completed clinical measures and a feasibility questionnaire to rate the user interface of MAPSS. Five professionals performed given tasks in MAPSS and completed usability questionnaires for the administration interface. RESULTS: Results showed no differences between the two assessment modalities with regard to symptom scores. The findings suggest good feasibility and usability of MAPSS in traumatized refugees. The administration via MAPSS was significantly shorter than the paper-pencil interview.

Work-Anxiety Rather Than Cognitive Performance Contributes to Workability Decisions in Patients With Mental Disorders,"Muschalla, B.","BACKGROUND: Mental workability decisions must be based on information on person's symptom load, cognitive performance, and workplace conditions. This investigation explores in which way these factors contribute to workability in persons with common mental disorders (CMDs). METHODS: One thousand five hundred seventy CMD-patients underwent multimodal medical diagnostic. Participants filled in questionnaires on work-phobic-anxiety and general mental symptom load. They were also investigated concerning their cognitive performance. Sick leave duration, workplace problems, and subjective workability were assessed. Physicians' decision on the persons' workability (fit or unfit for work) was given 5 weeks later. RESULTS: Negative workability perception, long previous sick leave duration, and high work phobic anxiety explained unfitness for work, whereas general symptom load and general cognitive performance did not.

Verbal learning impairment in adolescents with methamphetamine use disorder: a cross-sectional study,"Basedow, L. A.; Kuitunen-Paul, S.; Wiedmann, M. F.; Ehrlich, S.; Roessner, V.; Golub, Y.","BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA) use has been shown to be associated with deficits in impulsivity, verbal learning, and working memory. Additionally, methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is related to various brain changes, especially in adolescent users who might be more vulnerable to detrimental effects on brain development. However, little is known about the relationship between adolescent MA use and cognitive impairment. This cross-sectional study aims to explore how the presence of a MUD in adolescents is related to impairments of verbal memory, inhibition, and alertness. METHODS: N = 18 psychiatric outpatients with MUD were matched in terms of depressivity, age, and gender to n = 18 adolescents with other substance use disorders (SUDs), as well as n = 18 controls without SUDs. We compared these three groups on the Verbal Learning and Memory Task (VLMT), and the alertness and go/noGo subtests of the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP). Additionally, Spearman's rank order correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate whether cognitive functioning was directly associated with frequency of past year MA use. RESULTS: The three groups differed significantly in their verbal learning performance (H (2) = 11.7, p = .003, eta(p)(2) = .19), but not in short-term memory, inhibition, cued recall, or alertness. Post hoc tests revealed significant differences in verbal learning between the MA using group and the control group without a SUD (U = 56.5, p = .001, eta(p)(2) = .31). Frequency of past year MA use correlated negatively with short-term memory (rho = -.25, p < .01) and verbal learning (rho = -.41, p < .01). No other cognitive variables correlated significantly with MA use frequency. Significant p-values were considered significant after Bonferroni correction. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent MUD outpatients with regular MA use show specific impairment in verbal learning performance, but not in other basal cognitive functions when compared to adolescents without a MUD. Verbal learning and short-term memory performance is negatively associated with the frequency of MA use. Future research should apply longitudinal designs to investigate long-term effects of methamphetamine and reversibility of these effects on cognitive functioning.",2021,Mar 25,BMC Psychiatry,21,1,166,33765981.0,10.1186/s12888-021-03169-3,,#482,Basedow 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The Return of Fear: Variation of the Serotonin Transporter Gene Predicts Outcome of a Highly Standardized Exposure-Based One-Session Fear Treatment,"Wannemuller, A.; Moser, D.; Kumsta, R.; Johren, H. P.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: Methodological problems of existing research, such as the application of unstandardized treatments in heterogeneous samples, has hampered clear conclusions about the extent and direction to which allelic variation of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5- HTTLPR) is associated with a differential response to psychological treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on treatment outcome under highly standardized environmental conditions. METHODS: We treated 222 medication-free adults highly fearful of spiders, dental surgeries or blood, injuries and injections with a highly standardized exposure-based 1-session treatment and genotyped them for the 5-HTTLPR. Participants' subjective fear was assessed before, immediately after treatment and at 7 months of follow-up. RESULTS: There were no differences between 5-HTTLPR genotypes in treatment outcome effects at the immediate posttreatment assessment. However, we observed a highly significant genotype x treatment effect (p = 0.004) at the 7-month follow-up. Fear levels of homozygous S allele carriers differed from those heterozygous (p = 0.026) and homozygous (p = 0.012) for the L allele. Compared to posttreatment assessment, LL allele carriers exhibited a further fear decrease at the follow-up assessment. In contrast, SS allele carriers displayed a strong return of fear. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that genetic variation of the serotonin transporter is associated with differential stability of inhibitory learning processes, potentially reflecting heightened susceptibility for context-related processes that facilitate a return of fear in S allele carriers. If replicated, results suggest the 5-HTTLPR might represent a biomarker for the long-term outcome of brief exposure-based fear treatments and might inform genotype-based selection of psychotherapeutic interventions.",2018,,Psychother Psychosom,87,2,95-104,29462807.0,10.1159/000486100,,#483,Wannemuller 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Action inhibition in individuals with high obsessive-compulsive trait of incompleteness: An ERP study,"Dominke, C.; Graham-Schmidt, K.; Gentsch, A.; Schutz-Bosbach, S.","BACKGROUND: Missing action completion signals are assumed to trigger repetitive behavior and feelings of the action ""not being right"". This proposal is based mostly on individual's self-reports. Here, we investigated the influence of experimentally manipulated action completion experience and the obsessive-compulsive (OC) trait of incompleteness on behavioral and neurophysiological measures of action inhibition. METHODS: Action completion was manipulated in an adapted Go/NoGo task, and OC trait incompleteness was assessed in healthy participants. More commission errors and faster responses were expected after missing action completion, especially for individuals with high OC trait incompleteness. The inhibition-related event-related potentials (ERPs) N200 and P300 were also measured. RESULTS: High OC trait incompleteness led to more errors following omitted- and faster responses during commission errors following incongruent outcomes. Furthermore, lower N200 was associated with worse response inhibition, and high OC trait incompleteness was associated with reduced N200, but not reduced P300 amplitude. These findings provide evidence that trait-like feelings of incompleteness may underlie maladaptive action repetition and impaired inhibitory control as observed in OCD.",2021,Feb,Biol Psychol,159,,108019,33460785.0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108019,,#485,Dominke 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Validation of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS),"Terhorst, Y.; Philippi, P.; Sander, L. B.; Schultchen, D.; Paganini, S.; Bardus, M.; Santo, K.; Knitza, J.; Machado, G. C.; Schoeppe, S.; Bauereiss, N.; Portenhauser, A.; Domhardt, M.; Walter, B.; Krusche, M.; Baumeister, H.; Messner, E. M.","BACKGROUND: Mobile health apps (MHA) have the potential to improve health care. The commercial MHA market is rapidly growing, but the content and quality of available MHA are unknown. Instruments for the assessment of the quality and content of MHA are highly needed. The Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) is one of the most widely used tools to evaluate the quality of MHA. Only few validation studies investigated its metric quality. No study has evaluated the construct validity and concurrent validity. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the construct validity, concurrent validity, reliability, and objectivity, of the MARS. METHODS: Data was pooled from 15 international app quality reviews to evaluate the metric properties of the MARS. The MARS measures app quality across four dimensions: engagement, functionality, aesthetics and information quality. Construct validity was evaluated by assessing related competing confirmatory models by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Non-centrality (RMSEA), incremental (CFI, TLI) and residual (SRMR) fit indices were used to evaluate the goodness of fit. As a measure of concurrent validity, the correlations to another quality assessment tool (ENLIGHT) were investigated. Reliability was determined using Omega. Objectivity was assessed by intra-class correlation. RESULTS: In total, MARS ratings from 1,299 MHA covering 15 different health domains were included. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a bifactor model with a general factor and a factor for each dimension (RMSEA = 0.074, TLI = 0.922, CFI = 0.940, SRMR = 0.059). Reliability was good to excellent (Omega 0.79 to 0.93). Objectivity was high (ICC = 0.82). MARS correlated with ENLIGHT (ps<.05). CONCLUSION: The metric evaluation of the MARS demonstrated its suitability for the quality assessment. As such, the MARS could be used to make the quality of MHA transparent to health care stakeholders and patients.

Scientific studies on the problematic use of mobile phones have given initial indications of negative consequences, such as increased depression and anxiety rates and reduced sleep quality. The Problematic Use of Mobile Phone (PUMP) scale is a well evaluated, 20-item questionnaire, but a German version of the scale is still lacking. METHOD: An online sample (n = 723, age 27.8 +/- 11.2 years, 25.2% men) completed a German translation of the PUMP scale (PUMP-D). We conducted standard item analyses and calculated internal consistency and retest reliability. An exploratory (EFA) and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted using a random split of the sample, and correlations with the self-estimated time of mobile phone usage and a global self-rating of patterns of problematic use were computed. Additionally, a second sample (n = 256, age 25.0 +/- 8.8 years, 34.0% men) completed the paper version of the PUMP-D scale twice to determine the 14-day retest reliability.

Second, the relationship between the interpretation bias and levels of harmful drinking was investigated. METHODS: The sample included 125 clinically diagnosed AP and 69 clinically diagnosed control patients (CP) who had either a mood or an anxiety disorder. Participants completed a booklet containing 12 open-ended ambiguous scenarios. Seven scenarios were alcohol-relevant, and 5 were emotionally relevant, that is, panic- or depression-relevant. Participants were asked to read each scenario and to generate a continuation. In addition, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and Beck Depression Inventory were administered. RESULTS: Logistic multivariate multilevel analyses revealed that AP' probability of generating an alcohol-related continuation on all 3 scenario types was higher than that of CP. Moreover, alcohol-related interpretation biases were positively associated with levels of harmful drinking (i.e., AUDIT scores).

Neural correlates of fear conditioning are associated with treatment-outcomes to behavioral exposure in spider phobia - Evidence from magnetoencephalography,"Roesmann, K.; Toelle, J.; Leehr, E. J.; Wessing, I.; Bohnlein, J.; Seeger, F.; Schwarzmeier, H.; Siminski, N.; Herrmann, M. J.; Dannlowski, U.; Lueken, U.; Klucken, T.; Straube, T.; Junghofer, M.","BACKGROUND: Models of anxiety disorders and the rationale of exposure therapy (ET) are grounded on classical fear conditioning. Yet, it is unclear whether lower fear ratings of conditioned safety versus threat cues and corresponding neural markers of safety-learning and/or fear inhibition assessed before treatment would predict better outcomes of behavioral exposure. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with spider phobia completed pre-treatment clinical and experimental fear conditioning assessments, one session of virtual reality ET, a post-treatment clinical assessment, and a 6-month follow-up assessment. Tilted Gabor gratings served as conditioned stimuli (CS) that were either paired (CS+) or remained unpaired (CS-) with an aversive phobia-related and phobia-unrelated unconditioned stimulus (UCS). CS+/CS- differences in fear ratings and magnetoencephalographic event-related fields (ERFs) were related to percentual symptom reductions from pre- to post-treatment, as assessed via spider phobia questionnaire (SPQ), behavioral avoidance test (BAT), and remission status at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: We observed no associations between pre-treatment CS+/CS- differences in fear ratings and any treatment outcome. CS+/CS- differences in source estimations of ERFs revealed that higher CS- activity in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) was related with SPQ- and BAT-reductions. Associations between CS+/CS- differences and treatment outcomes were also observed in left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) regions, which additionally revealed associations with the follow-up remission status. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide initial evidence that neural pre-treatment CS+/CS- differences may hold predictive information regarding outcomes of behavioral exposure.

Research on attitudes toward Internet interventions might facilitate the dissemination of such interventions by identifying factors that help or hinder uptake and implementation, and by clarifying who is likely to benefit. This study examined whether attitudes toward Internet interventions moderate the effects of a depression-focused Internet intervention, and how attitudes change over the course of treatment among those who do or do not benefit. METHODS: We recruited 1,004 adults with mild-to-moderate depression symptoms and investigated how attitudes toward Internet interventions are associated with the efficacy of the program deprexis, and how attitudes in the intervention group change from pre to post over a 3 months intervention period, compared to a control group (care as usual). This study consists of a subgroup analysis of the randomized controlled EVIDENT trial. RESULTS: Positive initial attitudes toward Internet interventions were associated with greater efficacy (eta(2)(p) = .014) independent of usage time, whereas a negative attitude (perceived lack of personal contact) was associated with reduced efficacy (eta(2)(p) = .012). Users' attitudes changed during the trial, and both the magnitude and direction of attitude change were associated with the efficacy of the program over time (eta(2)(p) = .030).

RESULTS: Active treatments for PTSD yielded a large aggregated pre-post effect size (g = 1.29; 95% CI = [0.99; 1.59]) and a small to medium effect size at posttreatment when compared to control conditions (g = 0.39; 95% CI = [0.24; 0.55]). Effect sizes were similar for pretreatment versus follow-up (g = 1.75; 95% CI = [1.17; 2.32]) and in comparison to waitlist at follow-up (g = 0.93; 95% CI = [0.56; 1.31]). Active treatments for depression produced large pre-post (g = 1.28; 95% CI = [0.96; 1.61]) and controlled effect sizes (posttreatment, comparison to control conditions, g = 0.86; 95% CI = [0.54; 1.18]). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that psychological interventions can effectively reduce symptoms of PTSD and depression in LMICs. Future research needs to focus on cost-effective interventions that are likely to be disseminated to the large numbers of war survivors in LMICs.",2017,Aug,Depress Anxiety,34,8,679-691,28419625.0,10.1002/da.22618,,#493,Morina 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Dropout among patients in qualified alcohol detoxification treatment: the effect of treatment motivation is moderated by Trauma Load,"Odenwald, M.; Semrau, P.","BACKGROUND: Motivation to change has been proposed as a prerequisite for behavioral change, although empirical results are contradictory. Traumatic experiences are frequently found amongst patients in alcohol treatment, but this has not been systematically studied in terms of effects on treatment outcomes. This study aimed to clarify whether individual Trauma Load explains some of the inconsistencies between motivation to change and behavioral change. METHODS: Over the course of two months in 2009, 55 patients admitted to an alcohol detoxification unit of a psychiatric hospital were enrolled in this study. At treatment entry, we assessed lifetime Trauma Load and motivation to change. Mode of discharge was taken from patient files following therapy. We tested whether Trauma Load moderates the effect of motivation to change on dropout from alcohol detoxification using multivariate methods. RESULTS: 55.4% dropped out of detoxification treatment, while 44.6% completed the treatment. Age, gender and days in treatment did not differ between completers and dropouts. Patients who dropped out reported more traumatic event types on average than completers. Treatment completers had higher scores in the URICA subscale Maintenance. Multivariate methods confirmed the moderator effect of Trauma Load: among participants with high Trauma Load, treatment completion was related to higher Maintenance scores at treatment entry; this was not true among patients with low Trauma Load. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that the effect of motivation to change on detoxification treatment completion is moderated by Trauma Load: among patients with low Trauma Load, motivation to change is not relevant for treatment completion; among highly burdened patients, however, who a priori have a greater risk of dropping out, a high motivation to change might make the difference. This finding justifies targeted and specific interventions for highly burdened alcohol patients to increase their motivation to change.",2013,Mar 21,Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,8,1,14,23514277.0,10.1186/1747-597X-8-14,,#494,Odenwald 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Multidisciplinary treatment for traumatized refugees in a naturalistic setting: symptom courses and predictors,"Stammel, N.; Knaevelsrud, C.; Schock, K.; Walther, L. C. S.; Wenk-Ansohn, M.; Bottche, M.","Background: Multidisciplinary treatment approaches are commonly used in specialized psychosocial centres for the treatment of traumatized refugees, but empirical evidence for their efficacy is inconsistent. Objective: In order to obtain more evidence on the development of mental health and well-being of traumatized refugees who receive multidisciplinary treatment, symptom courses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and somatoform symptoms as well as in the subjective quality of life were investigated in the course of a multidisciplinary treatment. In addition, it was analysed if sociodemographic variables were predictors for possible changes in symptomatology and quality of life. Method: N = 76 patients of the outpatient clinic of a psychosocial centre for traumatized refugees receiving regular multidisciplinary treatment were surveyed using standardized questionnaires at three measurement points (at the beginning of treatment, and after an average of 7 and 14 months of treatment) in a single-group design. Results: Multilevel analysis showed significant improvements of symptoms of PTSD (p < .001), depression (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), and somatoform symptoms (p = .002) as well as of the subjective quality of life (p < .001) over time. Among the tested predictors (gender, age, country of origin), age was a significant predictor for the course of somatoform symptoms (p < .05). Younger patients showed greater improvements in symptomatology over time than older ones. Conclusions: The results suggest that the received multidisciplinary treatment had a positive effect on trauma-related symptoms as well as on quality of life of traumatized refugees. There was no indication that sociodemographic characteristics predicted the symptom courses of the patients, except for somatoform symptoms. Younger patients benefitted more from multidisciplinary treatment than older ones.",2017,2017/10/10,Eur J Psychotraumatol,8,sup2,1377552,29163866.0,10.1080/20008198.2017.1377552,,#496,Stammel 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Suicidal ideation, self-injury, aggressive behavior and substance use during intensive trauma-focused treatment with exposure-based components in adolescent and young adult PTSD patients","Fischer, A.; Rosner, R.; Renneberg, B.; Steil, R.","BACKGROUND: Multiple traumata such as child sexual and/or physical abuse often result in complex psychopathologies and a range of associated dysfunctional behaviors. Although evidence-based interventions exist, some therapists are concerned that trauma-focused psychotherapy with exposure-based elements may lead to the deterioration of associated dysfunctional behaviors in adolescents and young adults. Therefore, we examined the course of suicidal ideation, self-injury, aggressive behavior and substance use in a group of abuse-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients during phase-based, trauma-focused PTSD treatment. METHODS: Daily assessments from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Developmentally adapted Cognitive Processing Therapy (D-CPT) were analyzed to test for differences in the stated dysfunctional behaviors between the four treatment phases. We conducted multilevel modeling and repeated measure ANOVAs. RESULTS: We did not find any significant differences between the treatment phases concerning the stated dysfunctional behaviors, either at the level of urge or at the level of actual actions. On the contrary, in some primary outcomes (self-injury, aggressive behavior), as well as secondary outcomes (distress caused by trauma, joy), we observed significant improvements. DISCUSSION: Overall, during D-CPT, adolescents and young adults showed no deterioration in dysfunctional behaviors, while even showing improvements in some, suggesting that trauma-focused treatment preceded by skills building was not deleterious to this population. Hence, the dissemination of effective interventions such as D-CPT should be fostered, whilst the concerns of the therapists regarding exposure-based components need to be addressed during appropriate training. Nevertheless, further studies with momentary assessment, extended measurement methods, a control group and larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our preliminary findings.

The Impact of Negative Mood on Event-Related Potentials When Viewing Pornographic Pictures,"Markert, C.; Baranowski, A. M.; Koch, S.; Stark, R.; Strahler, J.","Background: Negative affective states may increase the risk for problematic pornography use. Underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are, however, not completely understood. Previous research suggests that the participants' emotional state may affect neural processing of sexual stimuli. The aim of this study was to investigate neural correlates of negative affect-induced alterations in sexual cue reactivity in healthy men. The moderating effects of habitual porn consumption, trait sexual motivation, and symptoms of cybersex addiction were also considered. Method: Sixty-four healthy men engaged in a sexual cue reactivity task (passive viewing of explicit sexual pictures and neutral pictures depicting scenes of social interaction) during negative (n = 32) vs. neutral affect (n = 32), induced via tailored feedback on a performance task. Self-reported sexual arousal and event-related brain potentials indicated cue reactivity and motivated attention. Symptoms of cybersex addiction and trait sexual motivation were assessed with the help of the short Internet Addiction Test, adapted to online sexual activities, and the Trait Sexual Motivation Questionnaire. Results: Negative feedback increased negative affect after the performance task. While sexual pictures compared to neutral pictures elicited significantly larger P300 and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes, there was no general effect of negative feedback on sexual stimuli-related P300 and LPP amplitudes. In the negative feedback group, men with higher solitary sexual motivation levels showed higher P300/LPP difference amplitudes for sexual stimuli compared to men with lower levels of solitary sexual motivation. The opposite effect was found in the group with neutral feedback. There was no link to other aspects of trait sexual motivation and symptoms of cybersex addiction. Conclusions: Results suggest that higher levels of solitary sexual motivation may enhance motivated attention toward sexual stimuli among men receiving negative performance feedback. Other characteristics of sexual behaviors and traits provided no exploratory value. Future studies extending onto men suffering from compulsive sexual behavior disorder will have to closer look at the neurophysiological bases of why and when some men develop an addictive pornography consumption.",2021,2021/07/05,Front Psychol,12,,673023,34290650.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.673023,,#498,Markert 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Comparing PTSD symptom networks in type I vs. type II trauma survivors,"Stefanovic, M.; Ehring, T.; Wittekind, C. E.; Kleim, B.; Rohde, J.; Kruger-Gottschalk, A.; Knaevelsrud, C.; Rau, H.; Schafer, I.; Schellong, J.; Dyer, A.; Takano, K.","Background: Network analysis has gained increasing attention as a new framework to study complex associations between symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A number of studies have been published to investigate symptom networks on different sets of symptoms in different populations, and the findings have been inconsistent. Objective: We aimed to extend previous research by testing whether differences in PTSD symptom networks can be found in survivors of type I (single event; sudden and unexpected, high levels of acute threat) vs. type II (repeated and/or protracted; anticipated) trauma (with regard to their index trauma). Method: Participants were trauma-exposed individuals with elevated levels of PTSD symptomatology, most of whom (94%) were undergoing assessment in preparation for PTSD treatment in several treatment centres in Germany and Switzerland (n = 286 with type I and n = 187 with type II trauma). We estimated Bayesian Gaussian graphical models for each trauma group and explored group differences in the symptom network. Results: First, for both trauma types, our analyses identified the edges that were repeatedly reported in previous network studies. Second, there was decisive evidence that the two networks were generated from different multivariate normal distributions, i.e. the networks differed on a global level. Third, explorative edge-wise comparisons showed moderate or strong evidence for specific 12 edges. Edges which emerged as especially important in distinguishing the networks were between intrusions and flashbacks, highlighting the stronger positive association in the group of type II trauma survivors compared to type I survivors. Flashbacks showed a similar pattern of results in the associations with detachment and sleep problems (type II > type I). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that trauma type contributes to the heterogeneity in the symptom network. Future research on PTSD symptom networks should include this variable in the analyses to reduce heterogeneity.",2022,2022/09/21,Eur J Psychotraumatol,13,2,2114260,36186163.0,10.1080/20008066.2022.2114260,,#499,Stefanovic 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Smartphone-based emotion recognition skills training for alexithymia - A randomized controlled pilot study,"Lukas, C. A.; Trevisi Fuentes, H.; Berking, M.","BACKGROUND: Neurobiological studies suggest that deficits in emotion recognition are common phenomena in alexithymia. Thus, effective treatments for alexithymia often include skills training in the domain of emotion recognition. Given that smartphone-based interventions (SBIs) offering skills training have been shown to be promising adjuncts to psychological treatments, a blended SBI facilitating the training of emotional skills might be effective in reducing alexithymia. METHODS: In this pilot trial, N = 29 individuals reporting elevated alexithymia levels were randomly assigned to a blended SBI including a psychoeducation session and 14 days of training with the mindtastic alexithymia app (MT-ALEX) or a psychoeducation-only control condition. Primary outcome was emotion recognition skills as assessed in a computer-based two-choice task paradigm. RESULTS: On average, participating in the SBI was associated with a significant increase in computer-assessed emotion recognition skills compared to the control condition (d = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Study findings provide preliminary evidence that SBIs can improve emotion recognition skills in alexithymic individuals.

Neural Correlates of Empathy with Pain Show Habituation Effects. An fMRI Study,"Preis, M. A.; Kroner-Herwig, B.; Schmidt-Samoa, C.; Dechent, P.; Barke, A.","BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the actual experience of pain and the perception of another person in pain share common neural substrates, including the bilateral anterior insular cortex and the anterior midcingulate cortex. As many fMRI studies include the exposure of participants to repeated, similar stimuli, we examined whether empathic neural responses were affected by habituation and whether the participants' prior pain experience influenced these habituation effects. METHOD: In 128 trials (four runs), 62 participants (31 women, 23.0 +/- 4.2 years) were shown pictures of hands exposed to painful pressure (pain pictures) and unexposed (neutral pictures). After each trial, the participants rated the pain of the model. Prior to the experiment, participants were either exposed to the same pain stimulus (pain exposure group) or not (touch exposure group). In order to assess possible habituation effects, linear changes in the strength of the BOLD response to the pain pictures (relative to the neutral pictures) and in the ratings of the model's pain were evaluated across the four runs. RESULTS: Although the ratings of the model's pain remained constant over time, we found neural habituation in the bilateral anterior/midinsular cortex, the posterior midcingulate extending to dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, the supplementary motor area, the cerebellum, the right inferior parietal lobule, and the left superior frontal gyrus, stretching to the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. The participant's prior pain experience did neither affect their ratings of the model's pain nor their maintenance of BOLD activity in areas associated with empathy. Interestingly, participants with high trait personal distress and fantasy tended to show less habituation in the anterior insula. CONCLUSION: Neural structures showed a decrease of the BOLD signal, indicating habituation over the course of 45 minutes. This can be interpreted as a neuronal mechanism responding to the repeated exposure to pain depictions, which may be regarded as functional in a range of contexts.",2015,2015/08/28,PLOS ONE,10,8,e0137056,26317858.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0137056,,#501,Preis 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Sex differences in PTSD risk: evidence from post-conflict populations challenges the general assumption of increased vulnerability in females,"Wilker, S.; Kolassa, S.; Ibrahim, H.; Rajan, V.; Pfeiffer, A.; Catani, C.; Kolassa, I. T.","Background: Next to the dose-dependent effect of trauma load, female sex represents a well-established risk factor for PTSD. Exposure to particularly toxic traumatic event types, different coping styles, and biological risk factors are frequently listed as potential causes for the increased PTSD vulnerability in females. Nevertheless, sex differences have not been consistently observed in all study populations. Objective: To investigate sex differences in PTSD risk in post-conflict populations from different countries while considering trauma load. Method: In civilian post-conflict samples from Northern Uganda (N = 1665), Rwanda (N = 433), Syria (N = 974) and Sri Lanka (N = 165), we investigated sex differences in PTSD risk while taking trauma load into account. PTSD and trauma load were assessed using standardized diagnostic interviews. Potential sex differences in PTSD risk were analysed by logistic regression analyses considering trauma load. Results: Across all samples, males reported more traumatic events than females. Both sexes predominantly reported war-related traumatic events. Without considering trauma load, sex effects in PTSD risk were only detected in the Syrian sample. When taking trauma load into account, evidence for an increased PTSD vulnerability in females was found in the Syrian sample, and, to a much lesser extent, in the Northern Ugandan sample. Conclusion: In contrast to the literature, we did not find evidence for a general increased PTSD vulnerability in females.

The Effects of an Internet-Based Imagery Rehearsal Intervention: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Gieselmann, A.; Bockermann, M.; Sorbi, M.; Pietrowsky, R.","BACKGROUND: Nightmares are extremely dysphoric dreams, which are prevalent and associated with psychological strain. This study investigated (a) the efficacy of an internet-based imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT), (b) the role of imagery rescription, and (c) the role of guidance during internet-based IRT. METHODS: A total of 127 patients suffering from mainly idiopathic nightmares were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 IRT internet-based groups (guided IRT; unguided IRT) or to 1 of 2 active control groups (frequency control group; narrative control group). RESULTS: IRT was more effective than a nightmare frequency control condition with respect to nightmare frequency and nightmare distress. Compared to the narrative control group, IRT was only superior in improving nightmare distress but not in nightmare frequency because the narrative control group also improved regarding nightmare frequency. Guidance by a nightmare coach did not affect efficacy, compliance, or dropout. CONCLUSION: Internet-based IRT seems to be an effective treatment even when offered with minimal guidance by a nightmare coach. Describing the nightmare narrative in detail already decreased nightmare frequency. However, with regard to inducing decreases in nightmare frequency and nightmare distress, IRT was superior to the narrative control group.

Smooth pursuit eye movement training promotes recovery from auditory and visual neglect: a randomized controlled study,"Kerkhoff, G.; Reinhart, S.; Ziegler, W.; Artinger, F.; Marquardt, C.; Keller, I.","BACKGROUND: No treatment for auditory neglect and no randomized controlled trial evaluating smooth pursuit eye movement therapy (SPT) for multimodal neglect are available. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of SPT and visual scanning therapy (VST) on auditory and visual neglect in chronic stroke patients with neglect. METHODS: A randomized, prospective trial was conducted. Fifty patients with left auditory and visual neglect were randomly assigned. Twenty-four patients completed SPT therapy and 21 patients VST. Five patients (4 VST, 1 SPT) were lost. Each group received 1-hour sessions of neglect therapy for 5 consecutive days totaling 5 hours. Outcome measures in visual neglect (digit cancellation, visuoperceptual- and motor line bisection, paragraph reading) and auditory neglect (auditory midline) were assessed twice before therapy, thereafter, and at 2-week follow-up. The SPT group practiced smooth pursuit eye movements while tracking stimuli moving leftward. The VST group systematically scanned the same but static stimuli. Both groups were divided into subgroups, and effects were separately investigated for mild and severe neglect. RESULTS: Both groups did not differ before therapy in clinical/demographic variables or neglect severity (auditory/visual). After treatment, the SPT group showed significant and lasting improvements in all visual measures and normal performance in the auditory midline. Neither visual nor auditory neglect impairments changed significantly after VST. Moreover, the treatment effect sizes (Cohen's d) were considerably higher for visual and auditory neglect after SPT versus VST, both for mild and severe neglect.

Differential Classical Conditioning of the Nocebo Effect: Increasing Heat-Pain Perception without Verbal Suggestions,"Brascher, A. K.; Kleinbohl, D.; Holzl, R.; Becker, S.","Background: Nocebo effects, including nocebo hyperalgesia, are a common phenomenon in clinical routine with manifold negative consequences. Both explicit expectations and learning by conditioning are known to induce nocebo effects, but the specific role of conditioning remains unclear, because conditioning is rarely implemented independent of verbal suggestions. Further, although pain is a multidimensional phenomenon, nocebo effects are usually assessed in subjective ratings only, neglecting, e.g., behavioral aspects. The aim of this study was to test whether nocebo hyperalgesia can be learned by conditioning without explicit expectations, to assess nocebo effects in different response channels, and to exploratively assess, whether contingency awareness is a necessary condition for conditioned nocebo hyperalgesia. Methods: Twenty-one healthy volunteers were classically conditioned using painful and non-painful heat stimuli that followed two different cues. The conditioned nocebo effect was assessed by subjective ratings of perceived stimulation intensity on a visual analog scale and a behavioral discrimination task, assessing sensitization and habituation in response to the same stimulation following the two cues. Results: Results show a conditioned nocebo effect indicated by the subjective intensity ratings. Conditioned effects were also seen in the behavioral responses, but paradoxically, behavioral responses indicated decreased perception after conditioning, but only for subjects successfully conditioned as indicated by the subjective ratings. Explorative analyses suggested that awareness of the contingencies and the different cues was not necessary for successful conditioning. Conclusion: Nocebo effects can be learned without inducing additional explicit expectations. The dissociation between the two response channels, possibly representing the conditioned and a compensatory response, highlights the importance of considering different outcomes in nocebo responses to fully understand underlying mechanisms. The present results challenge the role of explicit expectations in conditioned nocebo effects and are relevant with implications in clinical contexts, e.g., when transient adverse effects become conditioned.",2017,2017/12/13,Front Psychol,8,,2163,29321752.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02163,,#505,Brascher 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Adherence to Internet-Based Mobile-Supported Stress Management: A Pooled Analysis of Individual Participant Data From Three Randomized Controlled Trials,"Zarski, A. C.; Lehr, D.; Berking, M.; Riper, H.; Cuijpers, P.; Ebert, D. D.","BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to treatment is a prevalent issue in Internet interventions. Guidance from health care professionals has been found to increase treatment adherence rates in Internet interventions for a range of physical and mental disorders. Evaluating different guidance formats of varying intensity is important, particularly with respect to improvement of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Identifying predictors of nonadherence allows for the opportunity to better adapt Internet interventions to the needs of participants especially at risk for discontinuing treatment. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of different guidance formats (content-focused guidance, adherence-focused guidance, and administrative guidance) on adherence and to identify predictors of nonadherence in an Internet-based mobile-supported stress management intervention (ie, GET.ON Stress) for employees. METHODS: The data from the groups who received the intervention were pooled from three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of the same Internet-based mobile-supported stress management intervention (N=395). The RCTs only differed in terms of the guidance format (content-focused guidance vs waitlist control, adherence-focused guidance vs waitlist control, administrative guidance vs waitlist control). Adherence was defined by the number of completed treatment modules (0-7). An ANOVA was performed to compare the adherence rates from the different guidance formats. Multiple hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate predictors of nonadherence, which included gender, age, education, symptom-related factors, and hope for improvement. RESULTS: In all, 70.5% (93/132) of the content-focused guidance sample, 68.9% (91/132) of the adherence-focused guidance sample, and 42.0% (55/131) of the participants in the administrative guidance sample completed all treatment modules. Guidance had a significant effect on treatment adherence (F2,392=11.64, P<.001; omega(2)=.05). Participants in the content-focused guidance (mean 5.70, SD 2.32) and adherence-focused guidance samples (mean 5.58, SD 2.33) completed significantly more modules than participants in the administrative guidance sample (mean 4.36, SD 2.78; t223=4.53, P<.001; r=.29). Content-focused guidance was not significantly associated with higher adherence compared to adherence-focused guidance (t262=0.42, P=.67; r=.03). The effect size of r=.03 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.15) did not pass the equivalence margin of r=.20 and the upper bound of the 95% CI lay below the predefined margin, indicating equivalence between adherence-focused guidance and content-focused guidance. Beyond the influence of guidance, none of the predictors significantly predicted nonadherence. CONCLUSIONS: Guidance has been shown to be an influential factor in promoting adherence to an Internet-based mobile-supported stress management intervention. Adherence-focused guidance, which included email reminders and feedback on demand, was equivalent to content-focused guidance with regular feedback while requiring only approximately a quarter of the coaching resources. This could be a promising discovery in terms of cost-effectiveness. However, even after considering guidance, sociodemographic, and symptom-related characteristics, most interindividual differences in nonadherence remain unexplained.

Internet-based motivation program for women with eating disorders: eating disorder pathology and depressive mood predict dropout,"von Brachel, R.; Hotzel, K.; Hirschfeld, G.; Rieger, E.; Schmidt, U.; Kosfelder, J.; Hechler, T.; Schulte, D.; Vocks, S.","BACKGROUND: One of the main problems of Internet-delivered interventions for a range of disorders is the high dropout rate, yet little is known about the factors associated with this. We recently developed and tested a Web-based 6-session program to enhance motivation to change for women with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or related subthreshold eating pathology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of dropout from this Web program. METHODS: A total of 179 women took part in the study. We used survival analyses (Cox regression) to investigate the predictive effect of eating disorder pathology (assessed by the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire; EDE-Q), depressive mood (Hopkins Symptom Checklist), motivation to change (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale; URICA), and participants' age at dropout. To identify predictors, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. RESULTS: The dropout rate was 50.8% (91/179) and was equally distributed across the 6 treatment sessions. The LASSO analysis revealed that higher scores on the Shape Concerns subscale of the EDE-Q, a higher frequency of binge eating episodes and vomiting, as well as higher depression scores significantly increased the probability of dropout. However, we did not find any effect of the URICA or age on dropout. CONCLUSIONS: Women with more severe eating disorder pathology and depressive mood had a higher likelihood of dropping out from a Web-based motivational enhancement program. Interventions such as ours need to address the specific needs of women with more severe eating disorder pathology and depressive mood and offer them additional support to prevent them from prematurely discontinuing treatment.",2014,Mar 31,J Med Internet Res,16,3,e92,24686856.0,10.2196/jmir.3104,,#507,vonBrachel 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Development of a questionnaire measuring Attitudes towards Psychological Online Interventions-the APOI,"Schroder, J.; Sautier, L.; Kriston, L.; Berger, T.; Meyer, B.; Spath, C.; Kother, U.; Nestoriuc, Y.; Klein, J. P.; Moritz, S.","BACKGROUND: Only a minority of people suffering from depression receive adequate treatment. Psychological Online Interventions (POIs) could help bridge existing treatment gaps and augment the effectiveness of current treatments. Apart from effectiveness, user acceptance of POIs must be achieved if such interventions are to be broadly implemented in existing health-care. Valid measurement tools examining attitudes towards POIs are lacking. Therefore, we examined the dimensionality of attitudes towards POIs, developed a novel questionnaire, the Attitudes towards Psychological Online Interventions Questionnaire (APOI), and gathered data to examine its reliability. METHODS: We recruited a sample of 1004 adults with mild to moderate depressive symptoms from a range of sources. We constructed a set of 35 items based on literature review as well as expert and patient queries. The initial items were subjected to an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) in a randomly selected subsample. A final set of 16 items was subjected to a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to cross-validate the factor structure in a separate subsample. RESULTS: The EFA revealed four dimensions: ""Scepticism and Perception of Risks"", ""Confidence in Effectiveness"", ""Technologization Threat"" and ""Anonymity Benefits"".

Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Modulates Perceptual and Neural Patterns of Fear Generalization,"Roesmann, K.; Kroker, T.; Hein, S.; Rehbein, M.; Winker, C.; Leehr, E. J.; Klucken, T.; Junghofer, M.","BACKGROUND: Overgeneralization of fear is a pathogenic marker of anxiety and stress-related disorders and has been linked with perceptual discrimination deficits, reduced fear inhibition, and prefrontal hyporeactivity to safety-signaling stimuli. We aimed to examine whether behavioral and neural patterns of fear generalization are influenced by the fear-inhibiting ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). METHODS: Three groups of healthy participants received excitatory (n = 27), inhibitory (n = 26), or sham (n = 26) transcranial direct current stimulation of the vmPFC after a fear conditioning phase and before a fear generalization phase. We obtained, as dependent variables, fear ratings and unconditioned stimulus-expectancy ratings, perceptual aspects of fear generalization (perceptual discrimination), pupil dilations, and source estimations of event-related fields elicited by conditioned and generalization stimuli. RESULTS: After inhibitory (compared with excitatory and sham) vmPFC stimulation, we observed reduced performance in perceptual discrimination and less negative inhibitory gradients in frontal structures at midlatency and late time intervals. Fear and unconditioned stimulus-expectancy ratings as well as pupil dilation remained unaffected by stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a causal contribution of vmPFC reactivity to generalization patterns and suggest that vmPFC hyporeactivity consequent on inhibitory vmPFC stimulation may serve as a model for pathological processes of fear generalization (reduced discrimination, impaired fear inhibition via frontal brain structures). This encourages further basic and clinical research on the potential of targeted brain stimulation to modulate fear generalization and overgeneralization.",2022,Feb,Biol Psychiatry Cogn Neurosci Neuroimaging,7,2,210-220,34403785.0,10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.08.001,,#509,Roesmann 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Elevated costly avoidance in anxiety disorders: Patients show little downregulation of acquired avoidance in face of competing rewards for approach,"Pittig, A.; Boschet, J. M.; Gluck, V. M.; Schneider, K.","BACKGROUND: Pathological avoidance is a transdiagnostic characteristic of anxiety disorders. Avoidance conditioning re-emerged as a translational model to examine mechanisms and treatment of avoidance. However, its validity for anxiety disorders remains unclear. METHODS: This study tested for altered avoidance in patients with anxiety disorders compared to matched controls (n = 40/group) using instrumental conditioning assessing low-cost avoidance (avoiding a single aversive outcome) and costly avoidance (avoidance conflicted with gaining rewards). Autonomic arousal and threat expectancy were assessed as indicators of conditioned fear. Associations with dimensional symptom severity were examined. RESULTS: Patients and controls showed frequent low-cost avoidance without group differences. Controls subsequently inhibited avoidance to gain rewards, which was amplified when aversive outcomes discontinued. In contrast, patients failed to reduce avoidance when aversive and positive outcomes competed (elevated costly avoidance) and showed limited reduction when aversive outcomes discontinued (persistent costly avoidance). Interestingly, elevated costly avoidance was not linked to higher conditioned fear in patients. Moreover, individual data revealed a bimodal distribution of costly avoidance: Some patients showed persistent avoidance, others showed little to no avoidance. Persistent versus low avoiders did not differ in other task-related variables, response to gains and losses in absence of threat, sociodemographic data, or clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that anxious psychopathology is associated with a deficit to inhibit avoidance in presence of competing positive outcomes. This offers novel perspectives for research on mechanisms and treatment of anxiety disorders.",2021,Mar,Depress Anxiety,38,3,361-371,33258530.0,10.1002/da.23119,,#511,Pittig 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Familiality of neural preparation and response control in childhood attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder,"Albrecht, B.; Brandeis, D.; Uebel, H.; Valko, L.; Heinrich, H.; Drechsler, R.; Heise, A.; Muller, U. C.; Steinhausen, H. C.; Rothenberger, A.; Banaschewski, T.","BACKGROUND: Patients with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit difficulties in multiple attentional functions. Although high heritability rates suggest a strong genetic impact, aetiological pathways from genes and environmental factors to the ADHD phenotype are not well understood. Tracking the time course of deviant task processing using event-related electrophysiological brain activity should characterize the impact of familiality on the sequence of cognitive functions from preparation to response control in ADHD. Method Preparation and response control were assessed using behavioural and electrophysiological parameters of two versions of a cued continuous performance test with varying attentional load in boys with ADHD combined type (n = 97), their non-affected siblings (n = 27) and control children without a family history of ADHD (n = 43). RESULTS: Children with ADHD and non-affected siblings showed more variable performance and made more omission errors than controls. The preparatory Cue-P3 and contingent negative variation (CNV) following cues were reduced in both ADHD children and their non-affected siblings compared with controls. The NoGo-P3 was diminished in ADHD compared with controls whilst non-affected siblings were located intermediate but did not differ from both other groups. No clear familiality effects were found for the Go-P3. Better task performance was further associated with higher CNV and P3 amplitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Impairments in performance and electrophysiological parameters reflecting preparatory processes and to some extend also for inhibitory response control, especially under high attentional load, appeared to be familially driven in ADHD and may thus constitute functionally relevant endophenotypes for the disorder.",2013,Sep,Psychol Med,43,9,1997-2011,23200032.0,10.1017/S003329171200270X,,#512,Albrecht 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Feeling excluded no matter what? Bias in the processing of social participation in borderline personality disorder,"Weinbrecht, A.; Niedeggen, M.; Roepke, S.; Renneberg, B.","BACKGROUND: Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) feel ostracized even when they are included. This might be due to a biased processing of social participation in BPD. We examined whether patients with BPD also process social overinclusion in a biased manner, i.e., whether they feel ostracized even when the degree of social participation is increased. METHODS: An EEG-compatible version of Cyberball was used to investigate the effects of inclusion and overinclusion (33% vs. 45% ball receipt) on perceived ostracism, need threat and P3 amplitude, an EEG indicator for expectancy violation. Twenty-nine patients with BPD, 28 patients with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and 28 healthy controls (HC) participated. RESULTS: The P3 amplitude was enhanced for patients with BPD and SAD compared to HCs independent of condition. Both patient groups reported more perceived ostracism relative to HCs in the inclusion but not in the overinclusion condition. Only patients with BPD reported stronger need threat in both conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The EEG results imply that being socially included violates the expectations of patients with BPD, irrespective of the actual degree of social participation. However, when overincluded, patients with BPD no longer feel ostracized. Except for need threat, patients with SAD might show a comparable bias in the processing of social participation as patients with BPD.",2018,,Neuroimage Clin,19,,343-350,30013917.0,10.1016/j.nicl.2018.04.031,,#513,Weinbrecht 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Neural correlates of self-referential processing and implicit self-associations in chronic depression,"Renner, F.; Siep, N.; Lobbestael, J.; Arntz, A.; Peeters, F. P.; Huibers, M. J.","BACKGROUND: Patients with depression tend to process negative information with regard to the self (i.e. self-referential processing). A better understanding of the neural underpinnings of self-referential processing in patients with depression is clinically important as it can inform on potential treatment targets. METHOD: This fMRI study sought to study the neural correlates of self-referential processing in patients with chronic major depressive disorder (cMDD) (n=17) and non-patient controls (n=18) using a passive processing paradigm. Stimuli consisted of positive, negative, negative depression related and neutral personality trait words or non-words. Participants were instructed to indicate whether a presented word was an existing word or a non-word while undergoing an fMRI scan. Participants also completed an explicit and an implicit measure of positive and negative self-associations outside the scanner. RESULTS: Non-patient controls had relatively increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during processing of negative depression related vs. neutral words whereas patients with cMDD had relatively decreased activity. Non-patient controls had relatively increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity during processing of positive vs. neutral words whereas patients with cMDD had relatively decreased activity. Explicit but not implicit self-associations with depression related words were associated with neural activity in the mPFC and the dlPFC. LIMITATIONS: The study did not include a clinical control group and therefore the specificity of findings remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: The distinct neural processing of emotional self-relevant stimuli in the mPFC and the dlPFC in patients with cMDD might represent an emotional blunting response towards negative self-relevant stimuli.",2015,Nov 1,J Affect Disord,186,,40-7,26226432.0,10.1016/j.jad.2015.07.008,,#514,Renner 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Uncertainty increases neural indices of attention in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Dieterich, R.; Endrass, T.; Kathmann, N.","BACKGROUND: Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) experience abnormally high levels of uncertainty, and unpredictability is evaluated negatively and not well tolerated. The current study examined neural correlates of attentional processing in response to experimentally induced uncertainty in OCD. METHODS: Twenty-four OCD patients and 24 healthy controls performed a task where neutral and negative pictures were preceded by a cue, either being predictive (certain condition) or nonpredictive (uncertain condition) of subsequent picture valence. We examined prepicture anticipatory attention through alpha ( approximately 8-12 Hz) suppression, and attentional allocation during picture presentation with the P1, N1, P2, N2, and late positive potential (LPP) of the event-related potential. Additionally, we tested how clinical measures related to these attentional markers. RESULTS: Subjectively, patients overestimated the frequency of negative pictures after nonpredictive cues. Patients, but not controls, showed upper alpha(10-12 Hz) suppression after nonpredictive and predictive negative cues relative to predictive neutral cues. Only patients showed increased P2 and decreased N2 amplitudes for pictures after nonpredictive cues, and, whereas both groups showed increased LPP amplitudes for pictures after nonpredictive cues, this modulation was more pronounced in OCD during the early LPP (<1,000 ms). In patients, P2 and LPP amplitudes for negative pictures were associated positively with anxiety and negatively with depression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that OCD patients process anticipation of inevitable and potential threat similarly and highlight the substantial motivational impact of uncertain events to OCD patients.

An experimental study on the effectiveness of emotion regulation in patients with acute delusions,"Opoka, S. M.; Ludwig, L.; Mehl, S.; Lincoln, T. M.","BACKGROUND: Patients with psychotic disorders report to apply more maladaptive and less adaptive emotion-regulation (ER) strategies compared to healthy controls. However, few studies have used experimental designs to investigate the success in ER and the results of those at hand are equivocal. AIM: This study investigated whether patients with delusions show problems in downregulating negative affect via cognitive ER-strategies. METHOD: Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and acute delusions (n = 78) and healthy controls (n = 41) took part in an ER-experiment, in which they were instructed to downregulate anxiety and sadness via three ER-strategies (reappraisal, distraction, acceptance) or not to regulate their emotions (control-condition). ER-success was measured as the change in subjective emotion-intensity and physiological indicators (skin conductance and heart rate) from before to after regulation and was analyzed with mixed-repeated-measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: We found a significant effect of the ER-strategy in the sense that the subjective emotion-intensity was significantly lower after applying the reappraisal- and distraction-strategies than after the just view-condition (p's < .001). This effect was not found for the acceptance strategy (p = .060). There was no ER-strategy * time * group interaction-effect F(4.918, 575.416) = 0.778, p = .564, n(2)(partial) = 0.007. In all conditions, skin conductance decreased from pre- to post regulation (p < .001).

Effects of feedback-based visual line-orientation discrimination training for visuospatial disorders after stroke,"Funk, J.; Finke, K.; Reinhart, S.; Kardinal, M.; Utz, K. S.; Rosenthal, A.; Kuhn, C.; Muller, H.; Kerkhoff, G.","BACKGROUND: Patients with right or more rarely left parietotemporal lesions after stroke may have profound visuospatial disorders that impair activities of daily living (ADL) and long-term outcome. Clinical studies indicate improvements with systematic training of perception. Studies of perceptual learning in healthy persons suggest rapid improvements in perceptual learning of spatial line orientation with partial transfer to nontrained line orientations. OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated a novel feedback-based perceptual training procedure for the rehabilitation of patients after stroke. METHODS: In an uncontrolled trial, 13 participants showing profound deficits in line orientation and related visuospatial tasks within 12 to 28 weeks of onset performed repetitive feedback-based, computerized training of visual line orientation over 4 weeks of treatment. Visual line-orientation discrimination and visuospatial and visuoconstructive tasks were assessed before and after training. RESULTS: The authors found (a) rapid improvements in trained but also in nontrained spatial orientation tests in all 13 participants, partially up to a normal level; (b) stability of the obtained improvements at 2-month follow-up; (c) interocular transfer of training effects to the nontrained eye in 2 participants suggesting a central, postchiasmatic locus for this perceptual improvement; and (d) graded transfer of improvements to related spatial tasks, such as horizontal writing, analog clock reading, and visuoconstructive capacities but no transfer to unrelated measures of visual performance.

Habitual aversive and appetitive well-being comparisons in dysphoria: Introducing the Comparison Standards Scale for well-being,"Morina, N.; Schlechter, P.","BACKGROUND: People are constantly preoccupied with how they are doing compared to different standards. This preoccupation influences judgments of well-being, including depression. However, research on well-being comparisons is scarce, also due to a lack of a measure of multi-standard comparisons. METHODS: Our research goals were twofold. First, we validated the Comparison Standards Scale for well-being (CSS-W). Second, by drawing on central propositions of the general comparative-processing model, we examined the association of habitual well-being comparisons, their perceived discrepancies with the standard, and engendered affect with depressive symptoms and psychological well-being in dysphoric participants (N = 500). The CSS-W assesses habitual social, temporal, counterfactual, and criteria-based upward and downward comparisons regarding their a) frequency, b) perceived discrepancy, and c) engendered affect. RESULTS: The findings confirmed the theoretically expected two-factor solution representing aversive (mostly upward) and appetitive (mostly downward) comparisons. Comparison frequency, discrepancy, and engendered affect were associated with depression and well-being. Yet, aversive comparisons displayed higher associations with the outcomes than appetitive comparisons. In particular, frequency of appetitive comparisons was not significantly correlated to depression. In line with our central theory-driven hypothesis, the relationship between frequency of aversive comparisons with depression was partially mediated by serial effects of comparison discrepancy and affect, whereas the relationship with well-being was fully mediated by comparison discrepancy and affect. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design of the study does not allow for conclusions of causal relations between the measured variables.

Belief updating in depression is not related to increased sensitivity to unexpectedly negative information,"Kube, T.; Kirchner, L.; Rief, W.; Gartner, T.; Glombiewski, J. A.","BACKGROUND: People with depression differ from healthy people in the extent to which they use novel positive information to adjust negative expectations. In this study, we examined whether the two groups also differ in updating positive expectations after receiving unexpectedly negative information. METHODS: Examining 76 people with depressive symptoms and 81 healthy controls, we used an adapted version of a previously validated paradigm. After the initial establishment of positive performance expectations, participants worked on the TEMINT performance test, whereupon half of the participants received standardized feedback that confirmed previous positive expectations while the other half received disconfirming negative feedback. Subsequently, participants' performance expectations were assessed again. Additionally, we assessed participants' appraisal of the feedback, particularly whether they tended to disregard it. RESULTS: Results indicated that healthy subjects had overall more positive expectations than people with depressive symptoms, but the two samples did not differ in updating their expectations: both groups changed their expectations in a negative direction after receiving negative feedback; similarly, there were no differences between the two samples after receiving confirmatory positive feedback. Both people with and without depressive symptoms were more likely to disregard the feedback received if the feedback was negative, and such a negative appraisal of the feedback was associated with smaller expectation update. CONCLUSIONS: In combination with prior work, the current findings suggest that people with depressive symptoms do not over-sensitively react to unexpectedly negative information; rather, the main problem of depression seems to be the integration of novel positive information, as shown previously.",2019,Dec,Behav Res Ther,123,,103509,31715323.0,10.1016/j.brat.2019.103509,,#521,Kube 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Are perinatal measures associated with adolescent mental health? A retrospective exploration with original data from psychiatric cohorts,"Basedow, L. A.; Kuitunen-Paul, S.; Roessner, V.; Moll, G. H.; Golub, Y.; Eichler, A.","BACKGROUND: Perinatal markers of prenatal development are associated with offspring psychiatric symptoms. However, there is little research investigating the specificity of perinatal markers for the development of specific disorders. This study aimed to explore if perinatal markers are specifically associated with adolescent substance use disorder (SUDs). METHODS: Adolescent participants from two study centers, one for SUD patients (n = 196) and one for general psychopathology (n = 307), were recruited for participation. Since the SUD participants presented with a number of comorbid disorders, we performed a 1-on-1 matching procedure, based on age, gender, and specific pattern of comorbid disorders. This procedure resulted in n = 51 participants from each group. From all participants and their mothers we recorded perinatal markers (mode of birth, weeks of completed pregnancy, birth weight, Apgar score after 5 min) as well as intelligence quotient (IQ). The SUD sample additionally filled out the Youth Safe Report (YSR) as well as the PQ-16 and the DUDIT. We aimed to distinguish the two groups (SUD sample vs. general psychiatric sample) based on the perinatal variables via a logistic regression analysis. Additionally, linear regressions were performed for the total group and the subgroups to assess the relationship between perinatal variables and IQ, YSR, DUDIT and PQ-16. RESULTS: The perinatal variables were not able to predict group membership (X(2) [4] = 4.77, p = .312, Cox & Snell R(2) = 0.053). Odds ratios indicated a small increase in probability to belonging to the general psychiatric sample instead of the SUD sample if birth was completed via C-section. After Bonferroni-correction, the linear regression models showed no relation between perinatal markers and IQ (p = .60, R(2) = 0.068), YSR (p = .09, R(2) = 0.121), DUDIT (p = .65, R(2) = 0.020), and PQ-16 (p = .73, R(2) =0.021). CONCLUSION: Perinatal markers were not able to distinguish SUD patients from patients with diverse psychopathologies. This pattern contradicts previous findings, perhaps because our chosen markers reflect general processes instead of specific mechanistic explanations.

Group cohesion in group-based personal practice,"Maass, U.; Kuhne, F.; Hahn, D.; Weck, F.","BACKGROUND: Personal practice (PP) is an integral component of many psychotherapy training programmes. It aims to promote personal and professional growth and is often conducted in a group format (g-PP). Group cohesion is one of the most researched mechanisms in group psychotherapy, but has rarely been studied in the context of g-PP. AIMS AND METHOD: This exploratory study examines the associations between cohesion, satisfaction with g-PP, its impact on personal and professional development, and theoretical orientation in a sample of n = 329 German psychotherapy trainees. Cohesion was assessed with the group questionnaire (GQ-D; Positive Bonding, Positive Working, Negative Relationship). RESULTS: Overall, participants reported high levels of all outcome variables. Positive Bonding was the strongest predictor of satisfaction with g-PP (beta = 0.46, p<.001). While trainees in cognitive behaviour therapy reported significantly better cohesion scores (d>/=0.31), trainees in psychodynamic therapy reported significantly higher satisfaction with g-PP and its impact on their developments (d>/=0.30).

Interaction of physical activity and interoception in children,"Georgiou, E.; Matthias, E.; Kobel, S.; Kettner, S.; Dreyhaupt, J.; Steinacker, J. M.; Pollatos, O.","BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is associated with positive health outcomes, whereas physical inactivity is related to an increased risk for various health issues including obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Previous research indicates that interindividual differences in the perception of bodily processes (interoceptive sensitivity, IS) interact with the degree of PA in adults. Whether there is a similar relationship between PA and IS in children has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between IS and PA during physical performance tasks and in everyday situations. METHODS: IS was assessed using a heartbeat perception task in a sample of 49 children within the health promotion program ""Join the Healthy Boat"" which is implemented in several primary schools in the southwest of Germany. PA was examined using a physical performance task, assessing the distance covered during a standardized 6-min run. In a subsample of 21 children, everyday PA was measured by a multi-sensor device (Actiheart, CamNtech, Cambridge, UK) during five consecutive days with more than 10 h of daily data collection. RESULTS: Children with higher IS performed better in the physical performance task. Additionally, based on energy expenditure defined as metabolic equivalents, IS was positively correlated with the extent of light PA levels in the morning and afternoon.

Assessment of Capacity Impairment in Patients with Mental Disorders by Routine Clinical Assessment and by Structured Assessment with the Mini-ICF-APP,"Muschalla, B.; Poguntke, K. J.; Linden, M.","BACKGROUND: Physicians and therapists are also consulted to give judgments on working ability. Ability to work cannot simply be derived from the patient's symptom status but from the illness-related capacity impairments in relation to the work demands. A structured assessment of capacity impairments has been evaluated and applied internationally: the Mini-ICF-APP Social Functioning Scale. It is currently unclear whether a free-text clinical report (i.e., usual clinical practice: clinical exploration according to clinical standards, but without a standardized documentation form, instead a text is written) and a structured capacity assessment correspond to the overall work ability judgment, i.e., the decision whether a patient is ""fit for work"" or ""unfit for work."" OBJECTIVES: This investigation assessed, for the first time, whether usual clinical judgment and the additional structured capacity rating support the work ability decision. METHODS: A total of 100 medical reports from patients in a psychotherapy hospital were excerpted for psychopathological symptoms and capacity disorders using a checklist. Additionally, a structured assessment of capacity disorders was documented on the Mini-ICF-APP rating for all patients. RESULTS: In the free-text clinical medical report, endurance, flexibility, and contacts to others were the things mainly reported as impaired. This was similar to the structured Mini-ICF-APP rating. However, other capacity impairments were also reported in the Mini-ICF-APP, i.e., adherence to rules and regulations, planning and structuring, assertiveness, and group integration. When the free-text clinical report and the structured Mini-ICF-APP rating were compared, there was a higher rate of stated impairments covering all capacity dimensions in the Mini-ICF-APP rating. CONCLUSIONS: The free-text report in the medical report shows the differences between patients who are fit for work and those who are not, and thus speak for the validity of work ability decisions. However, optimization is possible in terms of depth and differentiation of capacity impairment description by adhering to the standard set by the Mini-ICF-APP.",2019,,Psychopathology,52,4,248-255,31578018.0,10.1159/000502123,,#529,Muschalla 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Bits and pieces. Food texture influences food acceptance in young children,"Werthmann, J.; Jansen, A.; Havermans, R.; Nederkoorn, C.; Kremers, S.; Roefs, A.","BACKGROUND: Picky or fussy eating is common in early childhood and associated with a decreased preference for a variety of foods. The aim of the current study was to test experimentally which sensory food feature influences food acceptance, which, in turn is an indication for fussy eating, in young children (32 - 48 months). Another aim was to evaluate if the behavioural measurement of food acceptance is related to parental reports of their child's fussy eating behaviour, parental feeding styles and children's BMI. METHOD: In a repeated-measures-design, three sensory features were manipulated separately (i.e., colour, texture and taste) while keeping the other two features constant. The baseline measurement consisted of a well-liked yoghurt, which was presented before each manipulation variant. The number of spoons that children (N = 32) consumed from each variant were registered as behavioural indication for food acceptance. Parental reports of children's eating behaviour and parental feeding styles; and children's BMI were also measured. RESULTS: The manipulation of food texture caused a significant decrease in intake. Colour and taste manipulations of the yoghurt did not affect children's intake. Parental reports of children's fussy eating behaviour and parental feeding styles were not related to the behavioural observation of food acceptance. The behavioural measurement of food acceptance and parental accounts of fussy eating were not related to children's BMI. CONCLUSION: Food texture but not taste or colour alternations affected food acceptance, at least when consuming variations of a well-liked yoghurt. This knowledge is important for further research on picky-eating interventions. Parental reports of fussy eating did not concur with the behavioural observation of food acceptance. Further research is warranted to test whether these findings generalize to other food types.",2015,Jan,Appetite,84,,181-7,25312750.0,10.1016/j.appet.2014.09.025,,#530,Werthmann 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Preoperative optimization of patient expectations improves long-term outcome in heart surgery patients: results of the randomized controlled PSY-HEART trial,"Rief, W.; Shedden-Mora, M. C.; Laferton, J. A.; Auer, C.; Petrie, K. J.; Salzmann, S.; Schedlowski, M.; Moosdorf, R.","BACKGROUND: Placebo effects contribute substantially to outcome in most fields of medicine. While clinical trials typically try to control or minimize these effects, the potential of placebo mechanisms to improve outcome is rarely used. Patient expectations about treatment efficacy and outcome are major mechanisms that contribute to these placebo effects. We aimed to optimize these expectations to improve outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. METHODS: In a prospective three-arm randomized clinical trial with a 6 month follow-up, 124 patients scheduled for CABG surgery were randomized to either a brief psychological pre-surgery intervention to optimize outcome expectations (EXPECT); or a psychological control intervention focusing on emotional support and general advice, but not on expectations (SUPPORT); or to standard medical care (SMC). Interventions were kept brief to be feasible with a heart surgery environment; ""dose"" of therapy was identical for both pre-surgery interventions. Primary outcome was disability 6 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes comprised further clinical and immunological variables. RESULTS: Patients in the EXPECT group showed significantly larger improvements in disability (-12.6; -17.6 to -7.5) than the SMC group (-1.9; -6.6 to +2.7); patients in the SUPPORT group (-6.7; -11.8 to 1.7) did not differ from the SMC group. Comparing follow-up scores and controlling for baseline scores of EXPECT versus SUPPORT on the variable disability only revealed a trend in favor of the EXPECT group (P = 0.09). Specific advantages for EXPECT compared to SUPPORT were found for mental quality of life and fitness for work (hours per week). Both psychological pre-surgery interventions induced less pronounced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations reflected by decreased interleukin-8 levels post-surgery compared to changes in SMC patients and lower interleukin-6 levels in patients of the EXPECT group at follow-up. Both pre-surgery interventions were characterized by great patient acceptability and no adverse effects were attributed to them. Considering the innovative nature of this approach, replication in larger, multicenter trials is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing patients' expectations pre-surgery helps to improve outcome 6 months after treatment. This implies that making use of placebo mechanisms has the potential to improve long-term outcome of highly invasive medical interventions. Further studies are warranted to generalize this approach to other fields of medicine.

Providing open-label placebos remotely-A randomized controlled trial in allergic rhinitis,"Kube, T.; Hofmann, V. E.; Glombiewski, J. A.; Kirsch, I.","BACKGROUND: Placebos can reduce physical symptoms even when provided with full honesty and disclosure. Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of ""open-label placebos"" (OLPs) have remained subject of debate. Furthermore, it is unclear whether OLPs are similarly effective when provided remotely, as is sometimes required e.g. in the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a randomized-controlled trial, we examined the effects of OLP plus treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone on symptom reduction in people with allergic rhinitis (N = 54) over the course of two weeks. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was provided remotely (i.e. sent via postal service). To investigate the potential influence of the clinical encounter on the effects of OLP, we manipulated the perception of the virtual clinical encounter, both with respect to verbal and nonverbal factors (augmented vs. limited encounter). RESULTS: The results of the manipulation check confirmed that the augmented clinical encounter was evaluated more positively than the limited encounter, in terms of perceived warmth of the provider. Participants from all treatment groups showed significant symptom reduction from baseline to two weeks later, but OLP had no incremental effect over TAU. Participants benefitted more from OLP when they did not take any other medication against allergic symptoms than when taking medication on demand. When controlling for baseline symptoms, a significant treatment by encounter interaction was found, pointing to greater symptom improvement in the OLP group when the encounter was augmented, whereas the control group improved more when the encounter was limited. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that providing OLP and enhancing the encounter remotely is possible, but their effectiveness might be lower in comparison to previous studies relying on physical patient-provider interaction. The study raises questions for future research about the potential and challenges of remote placebo studies and virtual clinical encounters. The study has been registered as a clinical trial at ISRCTN (record number: 39018).",2021,2021/03/11,PLOS ONE,16,3,e0248367,33705475.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0248367,,#532,Kube 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Expectancy Effects in Self-Help Depression Treatment: First Evidence that the Rationale Given for an Online Study Impacts the Outcome,"Cludius, B.; Schroder, J.; Moritz, S.","BACKGROUND: Positive expectations play an important role in effective treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD). The way a study is contextualized modulates prognostic expectations. AIMS: The aim of the study was to test the effect of differing information regarding the rationale given to participants for a study on depression symptoms. METHOD: Sixty-nine participants with depression symptoms participated in an online study with two conditions. In random order, half were invited to participate in a treatment study and half in a cognition study. After completing the baseline assessment, participants received one of two self-help manuals. Post-assessment was conducted six weeks later. RESULTS: Only about 64% of the participants were reached for post-assessment, and adherence was low. However, our results offer the first evidence that stronger improvements emerged in participants who were told the trial was a treatment study compared with a cognition study. CONCLUSION: Information given about the rationale for a study could influence symptom reduction in online treatments for patients with MDD.

Positive mental health moderates the association between suicide ideation and suicide attempts,"Brailovskaia, J.; Forkmann, T.; Glaesmer, H.; Paashaus, L.; Rath, D.; Schonfelder, A.; Juckel, G.; Teismann, T.","BACKGROUND: Positive mental health (PMH) has been shown to confer resilience against suicide ideation. However, it is unclear, whether PMH also buffers the relationship between suicide ideation and suicide attempts. The current study aimed to determine whether PMH moderates the association between lifetime suicide ideation and lifetime suicide attempts. METHODS: A total of 199 psychiatric inpatients with lifetime suicide attempts (female: n = 109; age: M = 37.56, SD = 14.38, range: 18-81) were interviewed on lifetime suicide ideation/behavior and completed a measure on PMH. RESULTS: PMH moderated the impact of lifetime suicide ideation on lifetime suicide attempts: For those individuals who reported high levels of PMH, the rate of lifetime suicide attempts was reduced even when experiencing frequent episodes of lifetime suicide ideation.

Post-stroke depression and functional impairments - A 3-year prospective study,"Schottke, H.; Gerke, L.; Dusing, R.; Mollmann, A.","BACKGROUND: Post-Stroke Depression (PSD) is a severe condition, affecting about 30% of stroke survivors within a five-year period after stroke. Post-stroke functional impairments (FI) and social support are associated with PSD. It is inconclusive, whether one of the factors, post-stroke FI and PSD, shows a stronger predictive value on the respective other over time. The aims of the present study were to 1) investigate the relationship between PSD, FI, and social support of stroke patients in a 3-year prospective design, and 2) address methodological shortcomings of previous studies. METHODS: We investigated 174 stroke survivors and assessed PSD with a structured clinical interview and a dimensional symptom rating scale. We conducted regression analyses and applied the approach of multiple imputations (MI) for missing data due to dropout during follow-up. RESULTS: PSD prevalence was 32.2% in the acute phase after stroke. Individuals with a PSD in this phase revealed a fivefold higher risk for PSD 3 years later. FI in the acute phase did not additionally contribute to the prediction of PSD at follow-up. Compared to individuals without PSD in the acute phase, individuals with PSD had an increased risk for FI at follow-up. Limitations regarding sample characteristics, design, and dropout are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that PSD rather than FI represents a crucial risk factor for negative long-term consequences regarding physical and psychological health after stroke. Post-stroke treatment might be optimized by a routine assessment of PSD and FI after stroke and considering the results for personalized treatment options.",2020,May,Compr Psychiatry,99,,152171,32179262.0,10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152171,,#535,Schottke 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"The influence of early depressive symptoms, social support and decreasing self-efficacy on depression 6 months post-stroke","Volz, M.; Mobus, J.; Letsch, C.; Werheid, K.","BACKGROUND: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most frequent mental disorder after stroke, affecting about 30% of stroke survivors. Despite extensive research, little is known about the influence of general self-efficacy (GSE) on PSD. We investigated the effect of GSE on depression six months post-stroke while controlling for established risk factors. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients from two rehabilitation centers with first-ever ischemic stroke were assessed around 8 weeks and 6 months after stroke. Baseline assessment included demographic variables, GSE scale, physical disability (Barthel-Index), stroke severity (modified NIH Scale), pre-stroke mental illness, cognitive status (Mini-Mental-State-Test), social support (F-SozU Questionnaire) and depressiveness (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS). Follow-up assessment included DSM-IV depression, GDS and GSE. The influence of each risk factor on PSD was analyzed by binary hierarchical regression. RESULTS: Baseline depressiveness (OR=1.41, p<.01) and social support (OR=.95, p=.03) predicted PSD. Decreasing GSE was associated with high baseline GSE (r=.51, p<.01) and influenced later PSD (OR=1.39, p<.01). LIMITATIONS: Patients' range of impairment may have been limited as sufficient speech comprehension and capacity for interview participation were required. Causal relationship between decreasing GSE and increasing GDS cannot be assumed based on correlations. DISCUSSION: Decreasing GSE was linked to PSD, especially in patients with high baseline GSE. This effect may be due to dissatisfaction with recovery following high expectations. Early depressive symptoms and low social support predicted PSD. Early screening for depressive symptoms and focusing on self-efficacy might help to prevent later depression.",2016,Dec,J Affect Disord,206,,252-255,27513631.0,10.1016/j.jad.2016.07.041,,#536,Volz 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Coping motives mediate the relationship between PTSD and MDMA use in adolescents with substance use disorders,"Basedow, L. A.; Wiedmann, M. F.; Roessner, V.; Golub, Y.; Kuitunen-Paul, S.","BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUDs) often co-occur in adolescent patients. Previous research has shown that these patients differ from SUD patients without PTSD in terms of their substance use patterns. In this study, we aimed to test whether substance use in this population is related to an attempt to self-medicate PTSD-related symptoms. METHODS: German adolescent patients (aged 13-18 years) at an outpatient clinic for SUD treatment, n = 111 (43% female), completed a self-designed questionnaire on use motives, a measure of PTSD-related experiences, and underwent a standardized psychiatric interview including structured substance use questions. Participants were subsequently classified as 'no traumatic experiences ('noTEs' but SUD), 'traumatic experiences but no current PTSD diagnosis' ('TEs' with SUD), and 'PTSD' with SUD. After establishing a self-designed motive measurement through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, we calculated non-parametric group differences and a mediation analysis in a linear regression framework. RESULTS: The past-year frequency of MDMA use was highest in the PTSD group and lowest in the noTE group (H (2) = 7.2, p = .027, eta(2) = .058), but no differences were found for frequencies of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, or stimulant use (all H </= 4.9, p >/= .085, eta(2) </= .033). While controlling for sex, the three groups showed a similar pattern (highest in the PTSD group and lowest in the noTE group) for coping scores (F (103) = 5.77, p = .004, eta(2) = .101). Finally, mediation analyses revealed an indirect effect of coping score (b = 0.61, 95% CI [0.29, 1.58], p = .145) on the association between group membership and MDMA use frequency. CONCLUSIONS: In adolescent SUD patients, we found an association of current PTSD and lifetime traumatic experiences with higher MDMA use that could be partially explained by substance use being motivated by an attempt to cope with mental health symptoms. This indicates a coping process involved specifically in MDMA use compared to the use of other psychoactive substances, possibly due to unique psychoactive effects of MDMA.",2022,Sep 4,Addict Sci Clin Pract,17,1,46,36057623.0,10.1186/s13722-022-00329-y,,#537,Basedow 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Associations between oxytocin and vasopressin concentrations, traumatic event exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms: group comparisons, correlations, and courses during an internet-based cognitive-behavioural treatment","Engel, S.; Schumacher, S.; Niemeyer, H.; Kuester, A.; Burchert, S.; Klusmann, H.; Rau, H.; Willmund, G. D.; Knaevelsrud, C.","Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by impairments in extinction learning and social behaviour, which are targeted by trauma-focused cognitive behavioural treatment (TF-CBT). The biological underpinnings of TF-CBT can be better understood by adding biomarkers to the clinical evaluation of interventions. Due to their involvement in social functioning and fear processing, oxytocin and arginine vasopressin might be informative biomarkers for TF-CBT, but to date, this has never been tested. Objective: To differentiate the impact of traumatic event exposure and PTSD symptoms on blood oxytocin and vasopressin concentrations. Further, to describe courses of PTSD symptoms, oxytocin and vasopressin during an internet-based TF-CBT and explore interactions between these parameters. Method: We compared oxytocin and vasopressin between three groups of active and former male service members of the German Armed Forces (n = 100): PTSD patients (n = 39), deployed healthy controls who experienced a deployment-related traumatic event (n = 33) and non-deployed healthy controls who never experienced a traumatic event (n = 28). PTSD patients underwent a 5-week internet-based TF-CBT. We correlated PTSD symptoms with oxytocin and vasopressin before treatment onset. Further, we analysed courses of PTSD symptoms, oxytocin and vasopressin from pre- to post-treatment and 3 months follow-up, as well as interactions between the three parameters. Results: Oxytocin and vasopressin did not differ between the groups and were unrelated to PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms were highly stable over time, whereas the endocrine parameters were not, and they also did not change in mean. Oxytocin and vasopressin were not associated with PTSD symptoms longitudinally. Conclusions: Mainly due to their insufficient intraindividual stability, single measurements of endogenous oxytocin and vasopressin concentrations are not informative biomarkers for TF-CBT. We discuss how the stability of these biomarkers might be increased and how they could be better related to the specific impairments targeted by TF-CBT.",2021,Mar 25,Eur J Psychotraumatol,12,1,1886499,33968321.0,10.1080/20008198.2021.1886499,,#538,Engel 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The role of memory-related gene WWC1 (KIBRA) in lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder: evidence from two independent samples from African conflict regions,"Wilker, S.; Kolassa, S.; Vogler, C.; Lingenfelder, B.; Elbert, T.; Papassotiropoulos, A.; de Quervain, D. J.; Kolassa, I. T.","BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) results from the formation of a strong memory for the sensory-perceptual and affective representations of traumatic experiences, which is detached from the corresponding autobiographical context information. Because WWC1, the gene encoding protein KIBRA, is associated with long-term memory performance, we hypothesized that common WWC1 alleles influence the risk for a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD. METHODS: Traumatic load and diagnosis of current and lifetime PTSD were assessed in two independent African samples of survivors from conflict zones who had faced severe trauma (n = 392, Rwanda, and n = 399, Northern Uganda, respectively). Array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed. The influence of WWC1 tagging SNPs and traumatic load on lifetime PTSD was estimated by means of logistic regression models with correction for multiple comparisons in the Rwandan sample. Replication analysis was performed in the independent Ugandan sample. RESULTS: An association of two neighboring SNPs in almost complete linkage disequilibrium, rs10038727 and rs4576167, with lifetime PTSD was discovered in the Rwandan sample. Although each traumatic event added to the probability of lifetime PTSD in a dose-dependent manner in both genotype groups, carriers of the minor allele of both SNPs displayed a diminished risk (p = .007, odds ratio = .29 [95% confidence interval = .15-.54]). This effect was confirmed in the independent Ugandan sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals an association between two WWC1 SNPs and the likelihood of PTSD development, indicating that this memory-related gene might be involved in processes that occur in response to traumatic stress and influence the strengthening of fear memories.",2013,Nov 1,Biol Psychiatry,74,9,664-71,23582269.0,10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.02.022,,#539,Wilker 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Preoperative anxiety and its association with patients' desire for support - an observational study in adults,"Salzmann, S.; Rienmuller, S.; Kampmann, S.; Euteneuer, F.; Rusch, D.","BACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety is prevalent and has harmful effects on postoperative outcomes. However, to date, it is still unclear (i) to what extent patients perceive preoperative anxiety as emotionally distressful, (ii) whether patients would welcome support from anesthesiologists in coping with their anxiety, and (iii) whether anxiety scores are useful for everyday clinical practice to determine patients' need for support. METHODS: 1082 patients scheduled to undergo elective procedures under general anesthesia were eligible for this cross-sectional study carried out at a university hospital. Preoperative anxiety, resulting in emotional distress, and patients' desire for anesthesiologists' support in coping with their anxiety were assessed dichotomously (no vs. yes) and analyzed descriptively. The intensity of anxiety was evaluated using the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (range 4-20). Associations between the intensity of anxiety and the resulting desire for support were analyzed using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to identify anxiety levels that best predict desire for support. RESULTS: Among the 1000 (537 female; M (SD) 57 (18) years) subjects evaluated, 493 (318 (65 %) female) reported anxiety. Anxiety was associated with emotional distress in 320 (65 %) and desire for support in 291 (59 %) patients. Increased preoperative anxiety levels were associated with higher rates of desire for support (B= 0.270; odds ratio 1.31 [95 % CI 1.22-1.41]). An anxiety score > 9 was best to predict a desire for support (sensitivity 0.861, specificity 0.724). However, desire for support was even present in some patients with lowest anxiety scores (5 or 6). CONCLUSIONS: All patients undergoing surgery should be screened for preoperative anxiety and the resulting desire for support to be able to determine who would welcome support. Anxiety scoring tools do not seem to be useful to identify these patients. By helping patients experience less preoperative anxiety, anesthesiologists may not only reduce patients' emotional distress but also have a positive impact on postoperative outcome.

Previous experiences with illness and traumatic experiences: a specific risk factor for hypochondriasis?,"Weck, F.; Neng, J. M. B.; Goller, K.; Muller-Marbach, A. M.","BACKGROUND: Previous experiences with illness and traumatic experiences are considered as important risk factors for the development of health anxiety and hypochondriasis. However, empirical research is insufficient and lacks adequate comparison groups. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, we sought to determine whether experiences with illness and traumatic experiences are really specific risk factors for hypochondriasis. METHOD: In the current study, patients with the diagnosis of hypochondriasis (n = 80), patients with a primary anxiety disorder (n = 80), and healthy controls (n = 83) were investigated regarding their previous experiences with illness (self and other) and traumatic childhood experiences. RESULTS: We found that patients with hypochondriasis reported a higher level of experience with illness and with traumatic childhood experiences than healthy controls. However, no differences were found between patients with hypochondriasis and those with an anxiety disorder, regarding their level of experience with illness and traumatic experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Previous experiences with illness and traumatic childhood experiences did not prove to be specific risk factors for the development of hypochondriasis. The importance of both experiences with illness and traumatic experiences as risk factors, as considered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual and in established cognitive-behavioral models, does not seem to be supported empirically.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of baseline T and one-year change in T with optimism and pessimism were investigated using age- and multivariable-adjusted regression models. RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses showed no association of T with optimism or pessimism in both sexes. Longitudinal analyses also showed no association of baseline T with optimism or pessimism at four-year follow-up. Multivariable analyses of total LOT-R score yielded similarly non-significant results (beta-coefficient per unit change in T for men: -0.01 (95% CI: -0.24-0.22), women: 0.08 (-0.03-0.20)). Furthermore, change in T was not related to optimism or pessimism at four-year follow-up.

Using bodily postures to reduce anxiety and improve interoception: A comparison between powerful and neutral poses,"Weineck, F.; Schultchen, D.; Hauke, G.; Messner, M.; Pollatos, O.","BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that anxiety syndromes are highly prevalent among university students. Effective treatments are needed to reduce the burden of anxiety in this population. Powerful postures have been found to impact affective states, as well as interoception (i.e. the ability to perceive inner bodily signals). However, no previous study has compared the effects of powerful- and neutral postures in regards to anxiety and interoceptive ability. METHODS: The first part of the study measured the single-session effect of adopting powerful- vs. neutral postures on students' (n = 57) interoceptive ability and state anxiety. The second part of the study measured the effect of adopting powerful or neutral postures twice daily for two weeks, on individuals' interoceptive ability and trait anxiety. RESULTS: State anxiety decreased in both conditions whereas interoceptive accuracy only increased in the power posing condition after a single session. Interoceptive accuracy increased in both groups after two weeks of training. LIMITATIONS: The study included no comparison to a condition where individuals adopted their natural (i.e. usual) bodily posture. CONCLUSIONS: Embodiment interventions that include elements of adopting an open or expansive bodily posture whilst maintaining a self-focus, can help to reduce state anxiety and improve interoceptive accuracy in student populations. Power posing does not seem to be superior to holding a neutral posture to improve interoceptive accuracy or anxiety. One reason therefore could be that both conditions include the manipulation of self-focus and a postural change that diverges from individuals' normal posture.",2020,2020/12/09,PLOS ONE,15,12,e0242578,33296377.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0242578,,#543,Weineck 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Familial transmission of a body-related attentional bias - An eye-tracking study in a nonclinical sample of female adolescents and their mothers,"Bauer, A.; Schneider, S.; Waldorf, M.; Adolph, D.; Vocks, S.","BACKGROUND: Previous research indicates that body image disturbance is transmitted from mother to daughter via modeling of maternal body-related behaviors and attitudes (indirect transmission) and via maternal body-related feedback (direct transmission). So far, the transmission of body-related attentional biases, which according to cognitive-behavioral theories play a prominent role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders, has not been analyzed. The current eye-tracking study applied the concepts of direct and indirect transmission to body-related attentional biases by examining body-related viewing patterns on self- and other-pictures within mother-daughter dyads. METHODS: Eye movements of N = 82 participants (n = 41 healthy female adolescents, mean age 15.82 years, SD = 1.80, and their mothers, mean age 47.78 years, SD = 4.52) were recorded while looking at whole-body pictures of themselves and a control peer. Based on fixations on self-defined attractive and unattractive body areas, visual attention bias scores were calculated for mothers and daughters, representing the pattern of body-related attention allocation. Based on mothers' fixations on their own daughter's and the adolescent peer's body, a second visual attention bias score was calculated, reflecting the mothers' viewing pattern on their own daughter. RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed an attentional bias for self-defined unattractive body areas in adolescents. The girls' visual attention bias score correlated significantly with their mothers' bias score, indicating indirect transmission, and with their mothers' second bias score, indicating direct transmission. Moreover, the girls' bias score correlated significantly with negative body-related feedback from their mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Female adolescents show a deficit-oriented attentional bias for one's own and a peer's body. The correlated body-related attention patterns imply that attentional biases might be transmitted directly and indirectly from mothers to daughters. Results underline the potential relevance of maternal influences for the development of body image disturbance in girls and suggest specific family-based approaches for the prevention and treatment of eating disorders.",2017,2017/11/27,PLOS ONE,12,11,e0188186,29176821.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0188186,,#544,Bauer 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Impaired cognitive control over emotional material in euthymic bipolar disorder,"Wolkenstein, L.; Kanske, P.; Bailer, J.; Wessa, M.; Hautzinger, M.; Joormann, J.","BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by deficits in cognitive control (CC). Impaired CC has been found in high-risk samples and is associated with the maintenance of BD symptoms. It remains unclear, however, whether BD is characterized by a general deficit in CC or by a deficit that is specifically related to the processing of emotional material. METHODS: The sample consisted of 42 remitted bipolar patients and 39 healthy controls (HC). We examined whether BD individuals display impaired CC when confronted with negative as well as positive material using an arithmetic inhibition task that required inhibition of pictorial stimulus material. RESULTS: Whereas both groups showed difficulties in exerting CC over negative material, only BD individuals exhibited deficient CC over positive material. LIMITATIONS: Even though we intended the negative and positive pictures in the arithmetic inhibition task to be similarly arousing, participants in the current study rated the negative compared to the positive pictures as more arousing. CONCLUSIONS: BD is associated with impaired CC when processing emotional - especially positive - stimuli even when patients are in remission.

Mood-incongruent processing during the recall of a sad life event predicts the course and severity of depression,"Brockmeyer, T.; Kulessa, D.; Hautzinger, M.; Bents, H.; Backenstrass, M.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that mood-incongruent processing constitutes an adaptive mood regulation strategy, and that difficulties in this process may contribute to the maintenance of depression. However, no study has yet examined whether mood-incongruent processing predicts the course and severity of clinical depression. METHODS: To address this question, the present study used a prospective, longitudinal design to examine the effects of mood-incongruent processing in a sample of 59 clinically depressed patients. At baseline, participants were asked to recall and describe a sad and a happy life event. Participants' utterances were transcribed and analysed using computerized text analysis. Negated emotion words were excluded. The proportion of positive emotion words during sad memory recall was used as an indicator of mood-incongruent processing. After 6 months, participants were re-assessed for symptom levels and the criteria of major depressive disorder (MDD) during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Higher relative frequency of positive emotion words during sad memory recall was associated with less symptoms of depression at follow-up and shorter time to recovery from MDD, over and above baseline symptoms of depression. The effect was not just due to increased general positivity in emotional expression or emotional expressiveness per se. LIMITATIONS: The sample size and the timeframe for the follow-up assessment were limited. Furthermore, it is unknown to which degree word use reflects the actual experience of the expressed emotions.

OBJECTIVES: Based on a diagnostic screening questionnaire, this study investigates the sensitivity of PCPs to recognize patients with depression as well as the factors facilitating recognition and concordant diagnostic decisions. METHOD: In a cross-sectional epidemiological study in six regions of Germany, 3563 unselected patients filled in questionnaires on mental and physical complaints and were diagnostically evaluated by their PCP (N = 253). The patient reports on an established Depression-Screening-Questionnaire (DSQ), which allows the approximate derivation of an ICD-10 depression diagnosis, were compared with the physician diagnosis (N = 3211).

Half of the patients identified by DSQ were diagnosed with depression by their physician and two thirds were recognized as mental disorder cases. More severe depression symptomatology and the persistent presence of main depression symptoms were related to better recognition and concordant diagnostic decisions. Diagnostic validation interviews confirmed the DSQ diagnosis in the majority of the false-negative cases. Indications for at least a previous history of depression were found in up to 70% of false-positive cases. CONCLUSION: Given the high prevalence of depression in primary care patients, there is continued need to improve the recognition and diagnosis of these patients to assure guideline-oriented treatment.",2018,Jan,Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,61,1,52-64,29189872.0,10.1007/s00103-017-2662-2,,#548,Beesdo-Baum 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Reducing procrastination using a smartphone-based treatment program: A randomized controlled pilot study,"Lukas, C. A.; Berking, M.","BACKGROUND: Procrastination affects a large number of individuals and is associated with significant mental health problems. Despite the deleterious consequences individuals afflicted with procrastination have to bear, there is a surprising paucity of well-researched treatments for procrastination. To fill this gap, this study evaluated the efficacy of an easy-to-use smartphone-based treatment for procrastination. METHOD: N = 31 individuals with heightened procrastination scores were randomly assigned to a blended smartphone-based intervention including two brief group counseling sessions and 14 days of training with the mindtastic procrastination app (MT-PRO), or to a waitlist condition. MT-PRO fosters the approach of functional and the avoidance of dysfunctional behavior by systematically utilizing techniques derived from cognitive bias modification approaches, gamification principles, and operant conditioning. Primary outcome was the course of procrastination symptom severity as assessed with the General Procrastination Questionnaire. RESULTS: Participating in the smartphone-based treatment was associated with a significantly greater reduction of procrastination than was participating in the control condition (eta(2) = .15). CONCLUSION: A smartphone-based intervention may be an effective treatment for procrastination. Future research should use larger samples and directly compare the efficacy of smartphone-based interventions and traditional interventions for procrastination.",2018,Jun,Internet Interv,12,,83-90,30135772.0,10.1016/j.invent.2017.07.002,,#549,Lukas 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Prevalence of prolonged grief disorder in a sample of female refugees,"Steil, R.; Gutermann, J.; Harrison, O.; Starck, A.; Schwartzkopff, L.; Schouler-Ocak, M.; Stangier, U.","BACKGROUND: Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) is a distinct syndrome that follows bereavement. It is different from other mental disorders and is characterized by symptoms such as yearning for the bereaved, or intense emotional pain or distress. Violent loss is one major risk factor for the development of PGD. OBJECTIVES: PGD has been studied in different populations, mostly in small samples, with only a few of them being representative. Although research highlighted that traumatic experiences paired with challenges related to migration make refugees particularly vulnerable to PGD, PGD has only rarely been studied in refugees. Thus, this article a) examines the prevalence of PGD in female refugees in Germany according to the criteria proposed by Prigerson and colleagues in 2009, and b) associates PGD with other common psychopathology (e.g. anxiety, depression, somatization and trauma). METHOD: A total of 106 female refugees were assessed for bereavement and PGD. Of these 106 individuals, 85 were interviewed using the Prolonged Grief Disorder Scale (PG-13). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25), somatization was assessed by the Somatization Subscale of the Symptom-Checklist-90 (SCL-90), and the number of witnessed and experienced trauma was assessed by the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS/HTQ). RESULTS: Ninety of the 106 participants had experienced bereavement, and among those, 9.41% met criteria for PGD. The most frequent PGD symptoms were bitterness, longing or yearning for the bereaved, and lack of acceptance of the loss. Furthermore, grief symptoms were significantly associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatization, and the number of experienced traumatic events. CONCLUSION: The PGD prevalence rate found corresponds with previous studies, demonstrating that prevalence rates for PGD are especially high in refugees. High prevalence rates of bereavement as well as PGD highlight the need for assessment and specifically tailored treatment of PGD in refugees. PGD goes along with significant psychopathology, which further emphasizes the need for treatment.",2019,May 14,BMC Psychiatry,19,1,148,31088419.0,10.1186/s12888-019-2136-1,,#552,Steil 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Further development in the assessment of psychological flexibility: validation of the German committed action questionnaire,"Terhorst, Y.; Baumeister, H.; McCracken, L. M.; Lin, J.","BACKGROUND: Psychological flexibility is considered a fundamental aspect of health. It includes six interrelated facets: 1) cognitive defusion, 2) acceptance, 3) contact with the present moment, 4) self-as-context, 5) values, and 6) committed action. To gain further insight into psychological flexibility and its effects on health, reliable and valid instruments to assess all facets are needed. Committed action is one facet that is understudied. A long and short version of a validated measure (CAQ and CAQ-8) have been developed in English. Currently, there are no German versions of the CAQ. Aim of this study is to validate German-language versions of these in a chronic pain population. METHODS: The CAQ instructions and items were translated and evaluated in a chronic pain population (N = 181). Confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken scale analysis were conducted to evaluate the German questionnaires. Correlations with health outcomes, including quality of life (SF-12), physical and emotional functioning (MPI, BPI, PHQ-9, GAD-7), pain intensity, and with other facets of psychological flexibility (CPAQ, FAH-II) were investigated for convergent validity purposes. Scale reliability was assessed by the alpha, MS, lambda-2, LCRC, and omega coefficient. RESULTS: A bifactor model consisting of one general factor and two methodological factors emerged from the analysis. Criteria for reliability and validity were met. Medium to strong correlations to health outcomes and other facets of psychological flexibility were found. Results were similar to the original English version. CONCLUSIONS: The present study presents a valid and reliable instrument to investigate committed action in German populations. Future studies could expand the present findings by evaluating the German CAQ versions in non-pain populations. The role of committed action and the wider psychological flexibility model in pain and other conditions deserves further investigation.",2020,Aug 3,Health Qual Life Outcomes,18,1,260,32746838.0,10.1186/s12955-020-01497-8,,#555,Terhorst 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Preventing Depression in Adults With Subthreshold Depression: Health-Economic Evaluation Alongside a Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial of a Web-Based Intervention,"Buntrock, C.; Berking, M.; Smit, F.; Lehr, D.; Nobis, S.; Riper, H.; Cuijpers, P.; Ebert, D.","BACKGROUND: Psychological interventions for the prevention of depression might be a cost-effective way to reduce the burden associated with depressive disorders. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a Web-based guided self-help intervention to prevent major depressive disorder (MDD) in people with subthreshold depression (sD). METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial was conducted with follow-up at 12 months. Participants were recruited from the general population via a large statutory health insurance company and an open access website. Participants were randomized to a Web-based guided self-help intervention (ie, cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy assisted by supervised graduate students or health care professionals) in addition to usual care or to usual care supplemented with Web-based psycho-education (enhanced usual care). Depression-free years (DFYs) were assessed by blinded diagnostic raters using the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis Disorders at 6- and 12-month follow-up, covering the period to the previous assessment. Costs were self-assessed through a questionnaire. Costs measured from a societal and health care perspective were related to DFYs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: In total, 406 participants were enrolled in the trial. The mean treatment duration was 5.84 (SD 4.37) weeks. On average, participants completed 4.93 of 6 sessions. Significantly more DFYs were gained in the intervention group (0.82 vs 0.70). Likewise, QALY health gains were in favor of the intervention, but only statistically significant when measured with the more sensitive SF-6D. The incremental per-participant costs were euro136 ( pound116). Taking the health care perspective and assuming a willingness-to-pay of euro20,000 ( pound17,000), the intervention's likelihood of being cost-effective was 99% for gaining a DFY and 64% or 99% for gaining an EQ-5D or a SF-6D QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports guidelines recommending Web-based treatment for sD and adds that this not only restores health in people with sD, but additionally reduces the risk of developing a MDD. Offering the intervention has an acceptable likelihood of being more cost-effective than enhanced usual care and could therefore reach community members on a wider scale.

Early Adverse Effects of Behavioural Preventive Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: An Online General Population Survey,"Witthoft, M.; Jungmann, S. M.; Germer, S.; Brascher, A. K.","BACKGROUND: Quarantine and physical distancing represent the two most important non-pharmaceutical actions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparatively little is known about possible adverse consequences of these behavioural measures in Germany. This study aimed at investigating potential early adverse effects associated with quarantine and physical distancing at the beginning of the countrywide lockdown in Germany in March 2020. METHOD: Using a cross-sectional online survey (N = 4,268), adverse consequences attributed to physical distancing, symptoms of psychopathology, and sociodemographic variables were explored in the total sample as well as in high-risk groups (i.e., people with a physical or mental condition). RESULTS: The most frequently reported adverse effects were impairment of spare time activities, job-related impairment, and adverse emotional effects (e.g., worries, sadness). Participants with a mental disorder reported the highest levels of adverse consequences (across all domains) compared to participants with a physical disease or participants without any mental or physical condition. No significant association between the duration of the behavioural protective measures and the severity of adverse mental health effects was observed. CONCLUSION: Results showed that non-pharmaceutical actions were associated with adverse effects, particularly in people with mental disorders. The findings are of relevance for tailoring support to special at-risk groups in times of behavioural preventive strategies.",2022,Sep,Clin Psychol Eur,4,3,e7205,36398008.0,10.32872/cpe.7205,,#561,Witthoft 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Brain structural alterations associated with dysfunctional cognitive control of pain in patients with low back pain,"Chehadi, O.; Rusu, A. C.; Konietzny, K.; Schulz, E.; Koster, O.; Schmidt-Wilcke, T.; Hasenbring, M. I.","BACKGROUND: Recent evidence has shown that chronic back pain (CBP) can lead to functional alterations in the circuitry underlying the cognitive control of pain. Thought suppression (TS) is a common type of cognitive control of pain. Previous research has shown that TS has paradoxical effects that may increase the awareness of pain. Pain-related TS may also increase individuals' attention to pain, which may also increase pain sensation, but thus far, the relationship between pain-related TS and structural brain alterations is unknown. METHODS: In this study, we investigated a group of 30 patients 6 months after lumbar disc surgery by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to identify brain regions correlated with TS scores. RESULTS: Since pain-related TS has been positively correlated with depression, all calculations were controlled for depression and age. VBM revealed a negative correlation between the TS score and regional grey matter volume (GMV) in the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG) and the left middle temporal gyrus (L MTG), which is part of the left temporoparietal junction (L TPJ). In addition, a mediation analysis revealed a significant mediation effect of the pain-related TS on the association between GMV of the left TPJ and reported pain intensity in the last 7 days. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with previous research on the dysfunctional cognitive control of pain and may therefore provide potential insights into the neural substrates of obstructive cognitive control in chronic low back pain, with a special emphasis on pain-related TS. SIGNIFICANCE: The link between pain-related thought suppression and brain morphology may provide a new perspective on the understanding of cognitive control of pain in chronic low back pain, which may help improve cognitive behavioural therapy.",2018,Apr,Eur J Pain,22,4,745-755,29239055.0,10.1002/ejp.1159,,#562,Chehadi 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Understanding the link between child maltreatment and adolescent future expectations in Northern Uganda: A serial mediation analysis,"Saupe, L. B.; Gossmann, K.; Catani, C.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND: Recent research has identified high levels of child maltreatment and harsh parenting in post-war societies which have had detrimental effects on children's development. Future expectations are an important aspect of adolescents' development particularly in the challenging contexts of post-war societies where social instabilities and violence are prevalent. To date, however, the link between child maltreatment and adolescent future expectations remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: By applying a socio-ecological perspective, this study aimed to investigate risk (internalizing symptoms) and protective factors (community integration) linking experiences of harsh parenting with adolescents' future expectations. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Data was collected from N = 199 northern Ugandan adolescents (40.2 % females, M(age) = 14.56 years) with structured interviews. METHODS: Serial mediation analyses were calculated with child maltreatment as the predictor, future expectations as the outcome, and internalizing symptoms as well as community integration as mediating variables. RESULTS: Results of the mediation model (R(2) = .22, F(5193) = 10.54, p <  .001, total effect (b = -0.28, p < .005) revealed a direct effect of child maltreatment on future expectations (effect size: -.20, 95 % bootstrap CI = -0.40, -.01) as well as an indirect effect of child maltreatment via internalizing symptoms and community integration on future expectations (effect size of -.07 (95 % bootstrap CI = -0.14, -0.01). CONCLUSION: Child maltreatment was found to be linked to negative future expectations among Northern Ugandan adolescents, and both internalizing symptoms as well as community integration played mediating roles in the associations.

Interpretation bias modification to reduce body dissatisfaction - a randomized controlled pilot study in women with elevated weight and shape concerns,"Bradatsch, S.; Vahl, M. D.; Potterton, R.; Gordon, G.; Schmidt, U.; Brockmeyer, T.","BACKGROUND: Recent research has identified several cognitive biases in patients with eating disorders, such as a tendency to interpret ambiguous information about one's own body in a negative way. The so-called ""negative interpretation bias"" is considered to be a key factor in maintaining maladaptive cognitions and behaviors in eating disorders. Studies on modification of the negative interpretation bias in eating disorders have yielded mixed results. This randomized controlled pilot study examined whether a specially adapted, computerized version of the Scrambled Sentences Task modifies negative interpretation bias in women with elevated body dissatisfaction. METHODS: The sample consisted of 40 normal-weight women with elevated body dissatisfaction, randomly assigned either to an intervention or a no-intervention control group (each n = 20). The intervention group received six sessions (within two weeks) of a newly-developed interpretation bias modification training that involved unscrambling positively valenced, body image-related sentences. The control group received no intervention. In both groups, body image-related negative interpretation bias (main outcome), trait body dissatisfaction and thin-ideal cue reactivity were assessed at baseline and two weeks later. Additionally, in the intervention condition, the trajectory of expected reductions in the thin-ideal internalization was measured during each training session. RESULTS: In both conditions, body image-related negative interpretation bias and trait body dissatisfaction decreased significantly from pre- to post-assessment; however, a specific effect imparted by the interpretation bias modification training was not found. Groups did not differ in thin-ideal cue reactivity. In the intervention group, thin-ideal internalization decreased significantly over the training sessions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings do not support use of body image-related interpretation bias modification in its current form in the treatment of body dissatisfaction. Further research involving different versions of the training and clinical samples is warranted.",2020,2020/07/02,J Eat Disord,8,1,34,32637101.0,10.1186/s40337-020-00305-4,,#565,Bradatsch 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Differential associations of positive and negative expectations with depressive symptoms,"Kube, T.; Herzog, P.","BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that dysfunctional expectations are a particularly important subtype of cognitions in depression. However, it is unclear whether depressive symptoms are related to the presence of negative expectations, the absence of positive expectations, or both. METHODS: Using hierarchical linear regression analyses, the present study examined the predictive value of positive situation-specific expectations, negative situation-specific expectations, dispositional optimism, and dysfunctional attitudes for depressive symptoms 8 weeks later in a nonclinical sample (N = 157). It also examined whether the relationship between dispositional optimism and dysfunctional attitudes with depressive symptoms is mediated through situational expectations. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, depressive symptoms were more strongly associated with the presence of negative expectations than with the absence of positive expectations. In the longitudinal and mediation analyses, none of the cognitive variables had significant associations with depressive symptoms at follow-up beyond the strong influence of baseline depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of negative expectations was cross-sectionally more strongly associated with depressive symptoms than a lack of positive expectations, presumably due to higher variability in negative expectations in this nonclinical sample. The longitudinal and mediation analyses failed to find significant incremental effects of any of the cognitive variables because baseline depression explained the largest proportion of variance.",2023,Mar,J Clin Psychol,79,3,762-772,36103396.0,10.1002/jclp.23442,,#566,Kube 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Even when you know it is a placebo, you experience less sadness: First evidence from an experimental open-label placebo investigation","Hahn, A.; Gohler, A. C.; Hermann, C.; Winkler, A.","BACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrate substantial effects of deceptive placebo on experimentally induced sadness, even on autonomic activity. Whether deception is necessary, remains to be elucidated. We investigated the effect of an open-label placebo (OLP) treatment, i.e. an openly administered placebo delivered with a convincing rationale for its sadness-protecting effect. METHODS: Eighty-four healthy females were randomized to an OLP group or a no-treatment control group. All participants received the same detailed information about the OLP effect, only the OLP group received an OLP nasal spray. Before and after the OLP intervention, participants underwent a sad mood induction procedure combining self-deprecating statements (Velten's method) and sad music. Sadness was assessed by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X). Autonomic activity was measured continuously. RESULTS: Participants in the OLP group reported a significantly attenuated increase in sadness upon mood induction and less sadness after induction compared to the control group (d = 0.79). Regardless of intervention, heart rate decreased during mood inductions with a more pronounced deceleration in the second mood induction. LIMITATIONS: Generalizability is limited due to the selective sample and the reliance on an experimentally controlled mood induction. CONCLUSION: OLP treatment had a beneficial effect on perceived sadness, at least at the subjective level. Hence, deception may not necessarily be required for placebos to modulate experienced sad mood. Investigating the beneficial effects of OLP in (sub-)clinical samples would seem a promising and required next step towards a clinical use of placebo-associated positive treatment expectations.",2022,May 1,J Affect Disord,304,,159-166,35181385.0,10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.043,,#567,Hahn 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The effects of brief chat-based and face-to-face psychotherapy for insomnia: a randomized waiting list controlled trial,"Gieselmann, A.; Pietrowsky, R.","BACKGROUND: Recent studies have directly compared the effects of Internet-based self-help interventions with face-to-face (FtF) treatment, but groups may also differ regarding other aspects, aside from the fact that the former is online and the latter offline. Thus, we examined the effects of a brief three-session psychotherapy for insomnia that was delivered FtF or through synchronous text-based chats. METHODS: Seventy-three patients diagnosed with insomnia were randomized to either FtF treatment, a chat-based treatment, or to a waiting list control group (WL). Treatment included topics that covered imagination, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, repetition, and consolidation. RESULTS: Compared to WL, patients in both groups improved regarding sleep quality (d(FtF) = 1.02, d(chat) = 1.69) and improvements remained at the two-month follow-up (FU; d(FtF) = 1.18, d(chat) = 2.40). Improvements in actigraphic sleep onset latency that had been gained at the post-test time point, disappeared at FU, while subjective improvements remained. At FU, patients in the chat group outperformed FtF patients regarding subjective total sleep time, anxiety, depression, and cognitive pre-sleep arousal. CONCLUSION: Three sessions were efficacious in treating insomnia, and the chat-based treatment slightly outperformed FtF treatment. This may be caused by the highly individualized treatment approach, by the fact that chatting forces both patients and therapists to adhere to the essence of the treatment goal, by increased feelings of privacy, autonomy, and a sense of felt responsibility for treatment. These hypotheses should be validated in future studies. So far, we can summarize that chat-based communication facilitates the treatment of patients who cannot or who do not want to attend FtF treatment.",2019,Sep,Sleep Med,61,,63-72,31262551.0,10.1016/j.sleep.2019.03.024,,#568,Gieselmann 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
An exploratory study of associations between the ICD-11 personality disorder model and eating pathology,"Stricker, J.; Barthels, F.; Muller, R.; Pietrowsky, R.","BACKGROUND: Recently, the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) has introduced a paradigm shift in personality disorder conceptualization. The novel ICD-11 personality disorder model comprises a dimensional assessment of personality dysfunction and five maladaptive personality trait domains. Maladaptive personality plays a central role in eating pathology. Yet, relations between the ICD-11 personality disorder model and eating pathology are, to date, unclear. Thus, this study aimed to explore the bivariate, incremental, and interactive associations of the ICD-11 personality disorder model components with eating pathology domains. METHODS: A predominantly female (85%) sample of 888 German-speaking community adults completed validated self-report measures of personality dysfunction, the ICD-11 personality trait domains, and five eating pathology domains (drive for thinness, bulimia, body dissatisfaction, orthorexia, binge eating). Bivariate and hierarchical regressions models were used to investigate bivariate, incremental, and interactive relations between the ICD-11 personality disorder model components and eating pathology. RESULTS: Personality dysfunction and the ICD-11 personality trait domains showed statistically significant bivariate relations with eating pathology. Additionally, personality dysfunction and most ICD-11 personality trait domains displayed incremental links with eating pathology. Finally, the relations of the ICD-11 personality trait domains with eating pathology were largely independent of the severity of personality dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that all ICD-11 personality disorder model components are uniquely linked to eating pathology. Beyond maladaptive personality trait domains, the strong and incremental relations of personality dysfunction with eating pathology have potential implications for theory building. Further research using longitudinal designs is needed to evaluate causal links between the ICD-11 personality disorder model components and eating pathology.The International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) contains a novel personality disorder model. We explored how this model's components (i.e., personality dysfunction, five maladaptive personality traits) relate to eating pathology. The model components were significantly and complementarily related to a drive for thinness, bulimia, body dissatisfaction, orthorexia, and binge eating. Hence, the ICD-11 personality disorder model may potentially prove helpful in better understanding individual differences in eating pathology.eng",2022,Aug 31,J Eat Disord,10,1,130,36045403.0,10.1186/s40337-022-00658-y,,#569,Stricker 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Mechanistic pathways of change in twice weekly versus once weekly sessions of psychotherapy for depression,"Bruijniks, S. J.

The present study investigated which pathways of change may account for the effects of different session frequencies. METHOD: The sample consisted of 200 patients who were randomized to CBT weekly, CBT twice weekly, IPT weekly, or IPT twice weekly. Outcome and therapy processes were measured at baseline, two weeks and monthly up to month 6 after the start of treatment. Latent change score models investigated temporal relations between change in therapy processes and change in depression and tested whether change in the therapy processes mediated the effect of session frequency on change in depression. RESULTS: IPT skills mediated the relation between session frequency and change in depression. A decrease in depression was related to subsequent improvement in CBT skills and subsequent decrease in motivation for therapy. CONCLUSION: The development of IPT skills may explain why a twice weekly higher session frequency is more effective in reducing depression compared to a once-weekly session frequency.

You Were Better Than Expected-An Experimental Study to Examine Expectation Change in a Non-clinical Sample,"Groth, R. M.; Rief, W.","BACKGROUND: Reduced sensitivity to rewards as well as the tendency to maintain dysfunctional expectations despite expectation-disconfirming evidence (cognitive immunization) are considered core features of various mental disorders. It is therefore important for clinical research to have paradigms that are suitable to study these phenomena. We developed a new experimental paradigm to study explicit expectation change after prior expectation induction and violation. Its validity is tested by applying the paradigm to healthy individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the main part of the study (experiment 1) we examined whether it is possible to change healthy individuals' (Sample size 56) task-specific and generalized performance expectations through expectation-disconfirming experiences. We used a high-difficulty performance task to induce initially negative expectations regarding participants' ability to successfully work on that unknown task. In the second part of the study, the difficulty of the test was lowered in one experimental condition, in order to disconfirm the negative expectations of the first part, while the other group continued with high test difficulty to confirm the negative expectations. We measured the participant's explicit performance expectations before and after completing the tests. In experiment 2 (Sample size 57), we investigated the impact of different test instructions on expectation change. Using the same paradigm as in experiment 1, we added an ""immunization-inhibiting"" manipulation for one group and an ""immunization-enhancing"" manipulation for the other group. RESULTS: In experiment 1, we were able to show that individuals changed their expectations according to variations of task difficulty. Adding instructions to manipulate cognitive immunization inhibited expectation change regardless of condition (experiment 2). CONCLUSION: Our approach allowed us to examine the effects of implicitly acquired performance expectations on explicit, verbalized expectation change. The new experimental paradigm used in this study is suitable to induce performance expectations, and to examine expectation-change among healthy individuals (experiment 1). Instructions to enhance or inhibit cognitive immunization processes both inhibited expectation change (experiment 2). The results are discussed within the context of current models of expectation change, cognitive immunization, and reward sensitivity.",2022,2022/07/11,Front Psychol,13,,862946,35898994.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.862946,,#571,Groth 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Inter-rater reliability and acceptance of the structured diagnostic interview for regulatory problems in infancy,"Popp, L.; Fuths, S.; Seehagen, S.; Bolten, M.; Gross-Hemmi, M.; Wolke, D.; Schneider, S.","BACKGROUND: Regulatory problems such as excessive crying, sleeping-and feeding difficulties in infancy are some of the earliest precursors of later mental health difficulties emerging throughout the lifespan. In the present study, the inter-rater reliability and acceptance of a structured computer-assisted diagnostic interview for regulatory problems (Baby-DIPS) was investigated. METHODS: Using a community sample, 132 mothers of infants aged between 3 and 18 months (mean age = 10 months) were interviewed with the Baby-DIPS regarding current and former (combined = lifetime) regulatory problems. Severity of the symptoms was also rated. The interviews were conducted face-to-face at a psychology department at the university (51.5 %), the mother's home (23.5 %), or via telephone (25.0 %). Inter-rater reliability was assessed with Cohen's kappa (k). A sample of 48 mothers and their interviewers filled in acceptance questionnaires after the interview. RESULTS: Good to excellent inter-rater reliability on the levels of current and lifetime regulatory problems (k = 0.77-0.98) were found. High inter-rater agreement was also found for ratings of severity (ICC = 0.86-0.97). Participants and interviewers' overall acceptance ratings of the computer-assisted interview were favourable. Acceptance scores did not differ between interviews that revealed one or more clinically relevant regulatory problem(s) compared to those that revealed no regulatory problems. CONCLUSIONS: The Baby-DIPS was found to be a reliable instrument for the assessment of current and lifetime problems in crying and sleeping behaviours. The computer-assisted version of the Baby-DIPS was well accepted by interviewers and mothers.

Encouraged by the effects of Web-based eating disorder prevention programs, we developed a manualized, Web-based aftercare program (IN@) for women with BN following inpatient treatment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of the web-based guided, 9-month, cognitive-behavioral aftercare program IN@ for women with BN following inpatient treatment. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled efficacy trial in 253 women with DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition) BN and compared the results of IN@ with treatment as usual (TAU). Assessments were carried out at hospital admission (T0), hospital discharge/baseline (T1), postintervention (T2; 9 months after baseline), 9-month follow-up (T3; 18 months after baseline). The primary outcome, abstinence from binge eating and compensatory behaviors during the 2 months preceding T2, was analyzed by intention to treat, using logistic regression analyses. Frequencies of binge eating and vomiting episodes, and episodes of all compensatory behaviors were analyzed using mixed effects models. RESULTS: At T2, data from 167 women were available. There were no significant differences in abstinence rates between the TAU group (n=24, 18.9%) and the IN@ group (n=27, 21.4%; odds ratio, OR=1.29; P=.44). The frequency of vomiting episodes in the IN@ group was significantly (46%) lower than in the TAU group (P=.003). Moderator analyses revealed that both at T2 and T3, women of the intervention group who still reported binge eating and compensatory behaviors after inpatient treatment benefited from IN@, whereas women who were already abstinent after the inpatient treatment did not (P=.004; P=.002). Additional treatment utilization was high in both groups between baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, data from this study suggest moderate effects of IN@. High rates of outpatient treatment utilization after inpatient treatment may have obscured potential intervention effects on abstinence. An aftercare intervention might be more beneficial as part of a stepped-care approach.

Reduced olfactory bulb volume in depression-A structural moderator analysis,"Rottstadt, F.; Han, P.; Weidner, K.; Schellong, J.; Wolff-Stephan, S.; Strauss, T.; Kitzler, H.; Hummel, T.; Croy, I.","BACKGROUND: Removal of the olfactory bulb (OB) leads to depression like behavior in rodents. A link between depression and olfactory function is also established in humans. We hypothesized that the human OB volume relates to depressive state and tested whether such a potential coherence is moderated by structural alterations in other brain regions. METHODS: Eighty-three participants (32 patients with major depression and 51 matched healthy controls) underwent structural MR scanning. Individual OB volumes were compared between patients and controls and the impact of depression and comorbidity was analyzed with multiple regression analysis. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry revealed structures co-varying with both depressive state and OB volume. RESULTS: The OB volume of patients was significantly reduced and this reduction averaged out at 17% compared to the controls. The OB volume was correlated to the volume of the insula, superior temporal cortex, and amygdala. The independent variables of depression (beta = -.37), age (beta = -.25), and gender (beta = -.40) explained the individual OB volume variation (R(2) = .37). The correlation between OB volume and depression was moderated by volumetric reductions in a cluster including the insula and superior temporal gyrus (STG). CONCLUSIONS: The OB volume relates to depression in humans and to the volume of structures which are critical for salience detection. We assume that a reduced OB volume causes diminished neural olfactory input which facilitates volume reduction in the insula and STG. The OB volume may hence constitute a factor of vulnerability to depression. Olfactory-based deep brain stimulation is discussed as a future therapeutic approach.",2018,Jun,Hum Brain Mapp,39,6,2573-2582,29493048.0,10.1002/hbm.24024,,#574,Rottstadt 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Repetitive Negative Thinking About Suicide: Associations With Lifetime Suicide Attempts,"Teismann, T.; Forkmann, T.; Michalak, J.; Brailovskaia, J.","BACKGROUND: Repetitive negative thinking has been identified as an important predictor of suicide ideation and suicidal behavior. Yet, only few studies have investigated the effect of suicide-specific rumination, i.e., repetitive thinking about death and/or suicide on suicide attempt history. On this background, the present study investigated, whether suicide-specific rumination differentiates between suicide attempters and suicide ideators, is predictive of suicide attempt history and mediates the association between suicide ideation and suicide attempts. METHOD: A total of 257 participants with a history of suicide ideation (55.6% female; Age M = 30.56, Age SD = 11.23, range: 18-73 years) completed online measures on suicidality, general and suicide-specific rumination. RESULTS: Suicide-specific rumination differentiated suicide attempters from suicide ideators, predicted suicide attempt status (above age, gender, suicide ideation, general rumination) and fully mediated the association between suicide ideation and lifetime suicide attempts. CONCLUSION: Overall, though limited by the use of a non-clinical sample and a cross-sectional study design, the present results suggest that suicide-specific rumination might be a factor of central relevance in understanding transitions to suicidal behavior.",2021,Sep,Clin Psychol Eur,3,3,e5579,36398103.0,10.32872/cpe.5579,,#576,Teismann 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Frequency of child maltreatment in a representative sample of the German population,"Iffland, B.; Brahler, E.; Neuner, F.; Hauser, W.; Glaesmer, H.","BACKGROUND: Representative data about the frequency of child maltreatment is needed in order to estimate the extent of the problem in the wider population as well as to provide the basis for interpretation of frequency rates in clinical samples. However, previous representative studies on the frequency of child maltreatment in Germany and other countries were limited as they focused on the assessment of physical and sexual abuse whilst emotional forms of maltreatment were ignored. In addition, previous studies applied scales that had not been validated against external criteria. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, standardized questionnaires were administered to a representative sample of the German population. Maltreatment in childhood and adolescence was assessed using the German version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Empirically derived threshold values for the five different types of child maltreatment including emotional maltreatment were applied to determine presence of abuse and neglect. RESULTS: Complete data was available from N = 2,500 subjects. Prevalence rates were 13.9% for emotional neglect, 10.2% for emotional abuse, 12.0% for physical abuse, 48.4% for physical neglect, and 6.2% for sexual abuse. Differences between sexes were found for the frequency of sexual abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis has found lower rates of child maltreatment than previous reports that used less well validated criteria, the results of this study confirm that child abuse, with its many different facets, is a significant problem in Germany.",2013,Oct 20,BMC Public Health,13,1,980,24139055.0,10.1186/1471-2458-13-980,,#577,Iffland 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Why dysfunctional expectations in depression persist - Results from two experimental studies investigating cognitive immunization,"Kube, T.; Rief, W.; Gollwitzer, M.; Gartner, T.; Glombiewski, J. A.","BACKGROUND: Research has revealed that negative expectations impact depressive symptoms. However, research on the change of dysfunctional expectations in depression is lacking so far. Therefore, the present research aimed to fill this gap by testing the hypothesis that people with the major depressive disorder (MDD), contrary to healthy individuals, maintain their expectations despite experiences that positively disconfirm expectations. Further, it was hypothesized that cognitive immunization (a cognitive reappraisal of the disconfirming evidence) is a mechanism underlying the persistence of expectations. METHOD: In Study 1, we compared individuals with MDD (N = 58) to healthy individuals (N = 59). Participants worked on the same performance test and received standardized feedback that either confirmed or disconfirmed their initial performance expectations. In Study 2, we investigated the effects of cognitive immunization on expectation change among 59 individuals reporting elevated levels of depression by varying the appraisal of expectation-disconfirming feedback. RESULTS: Results from Study 1 show that in the expectation-disconfirming condition, healthy individuals changed their expectations, whereas individuals with MDD did not. No such difference between the two groups was found for expectation-confirming feedback. Results from Study 2 indicated that varying cognitive immunization impacted expectation change, thus suggesting a crucial role of cognitive immunization in expectation change. CONCLUSIONS: These two studies indicated that individuals suffering from depression have more difficulties in changing their expectations after disconfirming experiences than do healthy individuals, and cognitive immunization might be a core mechanism underlying expectation persistence. Therefore, psychotherapeutic interventions should aim to inhibit cognitive immunization processes to enhance expectation change.",2019,Jul,Psychol Med,49,9,1532-1544,30131084.0,10.1017/S0033291718002106,,#578,Kube 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
How to modify persisting negative expectations in major depression? An experimental study comparing three strategies to inhibit cognitive immunization against novel positive experiences,"Kube, T.; Glombiewski, J. A.; Gall, J.; Touissant, L.; Gartner, T.; Rief, W.","BACKGROUND: Research has shown that negative expectations in major depressive disorder (MDD) often persist despite positive disconfirming experiences. To explain this phenomenon, the concept of cognitive immunization has been introduced: that is, individuals with MDD reappraise disconfirming positive evidence in such a way that negative expectations are maintained. In this study, we examined whether it is possible to inhibit cognitive immunization to facilitate expectation update. METHODS: We examined 113 people with MDD being treated in an inpatient psychosomatic hospital. Using a previously validated paradigm, participants worked on a standardized performance test; we examined changes in negative performance-related expectations after positive expectation-disconfirming feedback. One experimental group received additional information increasing the value of the positive feedback ('INFORMATION'). Another group was instructed to recall the feedback after completing the task ('RECALL'). In a third group, participants' attention was shifted to potential expectation-disconfirming feedback ('ATTENTION'). In addition, a control group underwent the standard procedure of the paradigm. RESULTS: The results showed significant group differences in the change in generalized performance expectations, with the largest changes in participants from the INFORMATION group. All experimental groups had lower values for cognitive immunization than the control group. LIMITATIONS: Given that this proof-of-concept study was the first to examine strategies to inhibit cognitive immunization, the findings need to be replicated in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that cognitive immunization in MDD can be inhibited, thus facilitating adjusting negative expectations. The most promising results were found for the INFORMATION group, providing information to emphasize the relevance of expectation-disconfirming information.",2019,May 1,J Affect Disord,250,,231-240,30870773.0,10.1016/j.jad.2019.03.027,,#580,Kube 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Sad as a Matter of Evidence: The Desire for Self-Verification Motivates the Pursuit of Sadness in Clinical Depression,"Arens, E. A.; Stangier, U.","BACKGROUND: Research on desired emotions revealed that individuals want to feel negative emotions if they expect these emotions to yield certain benefits. In previous studies, the pursuit of sadness (e.g., via pursuing art that evokes sadness) has been attributed to hedonic motives, i.e., to feel pleasure. We propose that in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) the pursuit of sadness may be more strongly related to self-verification motives, i.e., to sustain their sense of self through feeling sad. METHODS: Participants with MDD (n = 50) were compared to non-depressed controls (n = 50) in their desired emotional states, as indicated by selected music (sad, happy and neutral), and in their motives (hedonic vs. self-verification) for choosing sad music. Groups were also compared in their self-reported general preference for sadness and the perceived functionality of sadness. RESULTS: MDD participants showed a significant higher desire for sadness; more than half of them deliberately chose sad music. Whereas MDD participants had a marked preference for self-verification over hedonic motives, the reverse was true for non-depressed controls. MDD participants also agreed more strongly with self-verifying functions of sadness and expressed a stronger general preference for sadness. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that emotion regulation in MDD might be driven by self-verification motives. They point to the relevance of exploring patients' desired emotional states and associated motives. The systematic integration of positive affect into the self-image of depressed patients might help to deemphasize the self-verifying function of sadness, thereby overcoming the depression.",2020,2020/02/19,Front Psychol,11,,238,32153462.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00238,,#581,Arens 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Challenges in recruiting and retaining adolescents with abuse-related posttraumatic stress disorder: lessons learned from a randomized controlled trial,"Vogel, A.; Comtesse, H.; Rosner, R.","BACKGROUND: Research on effective recruitment and retention strategies for adolescents and young adults suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder is scarce. The aim of the current study was to provide data on recruitment sources, barriers, and facilitators for participation in a randomized controlled trial for young individuals with histories of sexual and/or physical abuse. METHODS: Study participants aged 14 to 21 were asked to complete a checklist on individual sources of recruitment, barriers, and facilitators for participation in the trial. Fifty-three out of the 80 study participants who were contacted completed the checklist (66.3%). RESULTS: Most respondents reported multiple recruitment sources, with online and media advertising search strategies indicated most frequently (45.4% of all mentions), followed by practitioner-referred sources (38.7%). Respondents' reported barriers included additional demands of the trial (60.3%), followed by distress caused by having to talk about painful topics (15.5%). The most frequently indicated facilitators were the organizational setting (55.1%) and monetary incentives (22.2%), followed by social support (12.0%) and non-monetary incentives (10.2%). No significant differences were observed between adolescent and young adult respondents with the exception that adolescents reported significantly more frequently that they had learned about the trial from their caregiver.

Effectiveness of a web-based cognitive behavioural intervention for subthreshold depression: pragmatic randomised controlled trial,"Buntrock, C.; Ebert, D.; Lehr, D.; Riper, H.; Smit, F.; Cuijpers, P.; Berking, M.","BACKGROUND: Research on the effectiveness of treatments for subthreshold depression (sD) is still scarce. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of a web-based guided self-help intervention (GET.ON Mood Enhancer) in the treatment of sD. METHODS: Participants with sD (n = 406) recruited from the general population via a large health insurance company were randomly allocated to a web-based cognitive behavioural intervention or to enhanced care-as-usual. The primary outcome was the reduction in depressive symptom severity as measured with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale at post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group showed a significantly greater pre-post reduction in depressive symptom severity (d = 1.06; 95% CI: 0.86-1.27) compared to the control condition (d = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.10-0.49). The corresponding between-group effect size was d = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.49-0.89).

"The relation between therapy quality, therapy processes and outcomes and identifying for whom therapy quality matters in CBT and IPT for depression","Bruijniks, S. J. E.; DeRubeis, R. J.; Lemmens, Lhjm; Peeters, Fpml; Cuijpers, P.; Huibers, M. J. H.","BACKGROUND: Research on which therapy processes are crucial for whom is necessary to optimize treatment outcomes for major depressive disorder (MDD) but may be impeded by a lack of variation in therapy quality and because of individual differences in therapy response. The present study used a dataset with large variation in therapy quality to investigate the impact of therapy quality on change in therapy processes and outcome. Machine-learning techniques were used to explore individual differences in these relationships. METHOD: Data come from a multicenter trial that randomized patients with MDD into weekly versus twice weekly sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Correlations between quality of therapy, change in therapy processes and depressive symptoms were calculated. Using elastic net regression, a prognostic model was developed that investigated individual differences. RESULTS: There were no significant correlations between therapy quality and change in therapy process variables or between therapy quality and therapy outcome, except between therapy quality and dysfunctional thinking and IPT skills. Improvement in therapy processes played a larger role in patients whose therapy outcome was poorly predicted by their baseline characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, in which therapy quality varied considerably, we found that therapy quality was not related to change in therapy processes or outcome. In addition, this study provides a first demonstration of proposed methods to identify individual responses to change in therapy processes. Results suggested that the importance of certain therapy processes might differ between patients. Future research into the relation between therapy quality, change in therapy processes and outcome should take into account the variation of therapy quality, focus on improved measurement of therapy quality and use a combination of machine learning techniques and experimental lab studies to determine to which extent and for whom therapy quality and change in therapy processes matter.",2021,Jan 28,Behav Res Ther,139,,103815,33581481.0,10.1016/j.brat.2021.103815,,#584,Bruijniks 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Placebo prevents rumination: An experimental study,"Rebstock, L.; Schafer, L. N.; Kube, T.; Ehmke, V.; Rief, W.","BACKGROUND: Rumination is a risk factor for the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms and represents an important target for the treatment of depression. In the present study, we aimed to examine whether rumination can be reduced when participants are led to believe that they would receive medication that would prevent them from ruminating. METHODS: In healthy participants (N= 91), an initial dysphoric state was induced via mood-suggestive music and autobiographic recall. Subsequently, participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an experimental group that received a deceptive active placebo via intranasal application accompanied by expectancy-enhancing instructions vs. a no-treatment control group. Then, rumination was induced via a rumination-activating task. The primary outcome was current rumination; experienced sadness was considered a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Consistent with the hypothesis, participants receiving the placebo reported a significantly lower increase in current rumination (d= 0.57) and a higher decrease in sadness (d= 0.69) after the experimental induction than the control group. LIMITATIONS: The external validity of this study might be limited due to the highly educated student sample. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that rumination processes as well as experienced sadness can be positively influenced by placebo treatment. To evaluate its clinical potential, placebo-induced expectancy effects in rumination research should be further examined, particularly with clinically depressed patients. Also, the results imply that clinicians might consider the effects of expectations on patients' rumination tendencies, for example by explicitly addressing patients' expectations about rumination, mood, and the treatment in general.",2020,Sep 1,J Affect Disord,274,,1152-1160,32663945.0,10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.010,,#585,Rebstock 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Psychophysiological mechanisms underlying the failure to speak: a comparison between children with selective mutism and social anxiety disorder on autonomic arousal,"Vogel, F.; Schwenck, C.","BACKGROUND: Selective mutism (SM) has been conceptualized as an extreme variant of social anxiety disorder (SAD), in which the failure to speak functions as an avoidance mechanism leading to a reduction of intense fear arousal. However, psychophysiological studies in children with SM are scarce and physiological mechanisms underlying the failure to speak are largely unknown. In contrast, children with SAD are characterized by a combination of a chronically elevated physiological arousal and a blunted physiological fear response to social stress. Due to the large overlap between SM and SAD, similar mechanisms might apply to both disorders, while differences might explain why children with SM fail to speak. The aim of our study is to investigate psychophysiological mechanisms of the failure to speak in children with SM. METHODS: We assessed in a total of N = 96 children [8-12 years, SM: n = 31, SAD: n = 32, typical development (TD): n = 33] resting baseline arousal in absence of social threat and the course of physiological fear response in two social stress paradigms, differing in terms of whether the children are expected to speak (verbal task) or not (nonverbal task). RESULTS: Children with SM were characterized by increased tonic arousal compared to the other two groups, and by a more inflexible stress response in the nonverbal but not in the verbal task compared to TD-children. Further analyses revealed that children with SM who did not speak during the verbal task already demonstrated reduced arousal in anticipation of the verbal task. CONCLUSION: The increased tonic arousal generalized to non-social situations in SM could indicate a long-term alteration of the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, the differential physiological stress response may indicate that silence acts as a maladaptive compensatory mechanism reducing stress in verbal social situations, which does not function in nonverbal situations. Our findings support the idea that the failure to speak might function as an avoidance mechanism, which is already active in anticipation of a verbal situation. Treatment of SM should take into account that children with SM may suffer from chronically elevated stress levels and that different mechanisms might operate in verbal and nonverbal social situations.",2021,Dec 28,Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,15,1,81,34963482.0,10.1186/s13034-021-00430-1,,#586,Vogel 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The relationship between attachment to pets and mental health: the shared link via attachment to humans,"Lass-Hennemann, J.; Schafer, S. K.; Sopp, M. R.; Michael, T.","BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated the relationship between emotional attachment to pets and mental health with the majority of studies finding a negative relationship between emotional attachment to pets and mental health. Interestingly, attachment to pets differs from attachment to humans with studies showing that humans with an insecure attachment style form a particularly strong emotional attachment to their companion animals. Human attachment style is also related to mental health with secure attachment being associated with superior mental health. Building on those findings, the current study aimed at exploring the role of attachment to humans in the relationship between emotional attachment to pets and mental health. METHODS: In this cross-sectional online survey (N = 610) we assessed the strength of emotional attachment to pets and attachment to humans. We further collected pet specific data as well as mental health burden in a sample of German dog owners (M(age)=33.12; 92.79% women). We used a mediation model estimating the indirect link between emotional attachment to pets and mental health burden via human attachment and the direct link between emotional attachment to pets and mental health burden simultaneously. RESULTS: We found that attachment to humans fully mediated the positive association between emotional attachment to pets and mental health burden. A stronger emotional attachment to one's dog was associated with lower comfort with depending on or trusting in others, whereby lower comfort with depending on or trusting in others was related to higher mental health burden. Moreover, a stronger attachment to one's dog was also related to a greater fear of being rejected and unloved (Anxiety), which was, in turn, associated with a higher mental health burden. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the positive link between emotional attachment to pets and mental health burden is fully accounted for by its shared variance with insecure attachment to humans in a sample mostly comprising self-identified women. Future studies need to examine whether strong emotional bonds with pets may evolve as a compensatory strategy to buffer difficult childhood bonding experiences.",2022,Sep 3,BMC Psychiatry,22,1,586,36057711.0,10.1186/s12888-022-04199-1,,#587,Lass-Hennemann 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Discrepancies Between Explicit Feelings of Power and Implicit Power Motives Are Related to Anxiety in Women With Anorexia Nervosa,"Weineck, F.; Schultchen, D.; Dunker, F.; Hauke, G.; Lachenmeir, K.; Schnebel, A.; Karacic, M.; Meule, A.; Voderholzer, U.; Pollatos, O.","BACKGROUND: Several studies identified low subjective feelings of power in women with anorexia nervosa (AN). However, little is known about implicit power motives and the discrepancy between explicit feelings of power and implicit power motives in AN. AIM: The study investigated the discrepancy between explicit feelings of power and implicit power motives and its relationship to anxiety in patients with AN. METHOD: Fifty-three outpatients and inpatients with AN and 48 participants without AN were compared regarding subjective feelings of power and anxiety. Explicit power [investigated with the Personal Sense of Power Scale (trait focus) and a visual analog scale (state focus)], implicit power motives [investigated with the Multi-Motive Grid (MMG)] and trait anxiety [measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)], were assessed. RESULTS: Explicit feelings of power (state and trait level) were lower in patients with AN compared to non-AN participants. No differences in implicit power motives were found when comparing the groups against each other. However, looking at the groups separately, women with AN had similar levels of implicit fear of losing power and hope for power, whereas woman without AN had significantly lower fear of losing power than hope for power. Focusing on discrepancies between powerful feelings and power motives, results were mixed, depending on the subscale of the MMG. Lastly, discrepancies between implicit power motives and explicit feelings of power were positively correlated with trait anxiety in AN patients. CONCLUSION: These findings underline that individuals with AN display significantly lower explicit feelings of power, however, they show similar implicit power motives compared to individuals without AN.

When decisions should be shared: a study of social norms in medical decision making using a factorial survey approach,"Muller-Engelmann, M.; Donner-Banzhoff, N.; Keller, H.; Rosinger, L.; Sauer, C.; Rehfeldt, K.; Krones, T.","BACKGROUND: Shared decision making (SDM) is often advocated as an ideal for making medical decisions. Until now, however, opinions regarding which treatment situations warrant SDM have not been systematically investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine social norms regarding medical decision making, using a factorial survey design. METHODS: The factorial survey applied in this study consisted of 7 situational factors (e.g., the reason for consultation), each with 2 to 3 levels (e.g., prevention and severe disease). These factors were turned into various descriptions of treatment situations. A total of 101 physicians, 115 patients, and 113 members of self-help groups participated in the study. Each participant assessed 10 vignettes using a 5-point scale to indicate who they thought should make the decision in each specific situation. RESULTS: Most assessments across the 3 groups called for a shared decision (39%). Ordered logistic regression analysis demonstrated that, according to study participants, all 7 situational factors (reason for consultation, time frame of negative outcomes, time pressure, number of therapeutic options, side effects, scientific evidence of efficacy, and desire to participate) significantly affected how decisions regarding treatment should be made. The strongest factor was the patient's desire to participate in decision making (odds ratio = 1.84; P </= 0.001), followed by the reason for consultation (odds ratio = 0.69; P </= 0.001).

The aim of the present study is to estimate the psychological consequences of this conflict among the refugee population who fled to Iraq. METHOD: In 2017, a team of locally trained psychologists and social workers interviewed 494 married couples (988 individuals) who were Syrian Kurdish refugees in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Validated Kurdish Kurmanji and Arabic versions of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 and depression section of Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 were used for assessing PTSD and depression symptoms. RESULTS: Almost all of the participants (98.5%) had experienced at least one traumatic event and 86.3% of them experienced three or more traumatic event types. The prevalence of probable PTSD was about 60%. Gender, length of time in the camp, area in which participants were grown up, and the number of traumatic event types were significant predictors for the presence of PTSD symptoms. Approximately the same rate of participants (59.4%) experienced probable depression, which was associated with gender, age, time spent in the camp, and the number of traumatic event types.

Visual Triggers of Skin Picking Episodes: An Experimental Study in Self-Reported Skin Picking Disorder and Atopic Dermatitis,"Mehrmann, L. M.; Urban, A.; Gerlach, A. L.","BACKGROUND: Skin Picking Disorder (SPD) is a new diagnosis with limited information available about triggers of picking episodes. Itch can be induced via audio-visual stimuli and the effect of contagious itch is stronger for those affected by atopic dermatitis. We examined if picking-related visual stimuli can trigger the urge to pick skin in self-reported SPD. We compared itch and the urge to pick in a sample of AD and/or SPD-affected to controls without either. METHOD: Urge to pick skin and/or scratch when viewing 24 itch-related, picking-related or neutral online pictures was assessed in adult females, who self-report skin-picking (SPD-only, n = 147) and/or atopic dermatitis (AD-only, n = 47; AD+SPD, n = 46) as well as in skin healthy controls (HC, n = 361). RESULTS: All participants reported a stronger urge to pick for picking-related pictures compared to neutral content (F[1, 597] = 533.96, p < .001, etap2 = .472) and more itch for itch-related pictures compared to neutral stimuli (F[1, 597] = 518.73, p < .001, etap2 = .465). SPD-all (SPD-only & AD+SPD) reported stronger urges to pick for picking-related vs. other stimuli compared to the AD-only and HC group (p < .001, etap2 = .047). Likewise, AD-all (AD-only & AD+SPD) reported significantly stronger itching for itch-related vs. other stimuli compared to SPD-only and HC (p = .001, etap2 = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Analog to visual provocation of itch, the urge to pick can be triggered by visual stimuli. Treatments for SPD and AD may profit from addressing visual stimuli.",2020,Dec,Clin Psychol Eur,2,4,e2931,36398062.0,10.32872/cpe.v2i4.2931,,#593,Mehrmann 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The effect of depressive symptomatology on the association of vitamin D and sleep,"Mergl, R.; Dogan-Sander, E.; Willenberg, A.; Wirkner, K.; Kratzsch, J.; Riedel-Heller, S.; Allgaier, A. K.; Hegerl, U.; Sander, C.","BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders and vitamin D deficiency are highly prevalent health problems. Few studies examined the effect of vitamin D concentrations on objectively measured sleep with high methodological quality and temporal proximity. Previous analysis within the LIFE-Adult-Study suggested that a lower concentration of serum vitamin D was associated with both shorter and later night sleep. However, no conclusion about underlying mechanisms could be drawn. We addressed the question whether this relationship is explained by the presence of depressive syndromes, which are linked to both vitamin D deficiency and sleep disturbances. METHODS: It was investigated whether the association of vitamin D concentrations and night sleep parameters is mediated or moderated by depressive symptomatology. We investigated a subset (n = 1252) of the community sample from the LIFE-Adult-Study, in which sleep parameters had been objectively assessed using actigraphy, based on which two sleep parameters were calculated: night sleep duration and midsleep time. Serum 25(OH) D concentrations were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Depressive symptomatology was evaluated with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The mediation effect was analyzed by using Hayes' PROCESS macro tool for SPSS for Windows. RESULTS: The depressive symptomatology was neither significantly associated with night sleep duration nor midsleep time. The associations between vitamin D concentrations and night sleep duration/midsleep time through mediation by depressive symptomatology were not significant. Corresponding moderator analyses were also non-significant. CONCLUSION: The associations between vitamin D concentrations and night sleep parameters (sleep duration and midsleep time) seem to be neither mediated nor moderated by depressive symptomatology.",2021,Apr 6,BMC Psychiatry,21,1,178,33823823.0,10.1186/s12888-021-03176-4,,#594,Mergl 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Sleep and somatic complaints in university students,"Schlarb, A. A.; Classen, M.; Hellmann, S. M.; Vogele, C.; Gulewitsch, M. D.","BACKGROUND: Sleep problems are common among university students. Poor sleep is associated with impaired daily functioning, increased risk of psychiatric symptoms, and somatic complaints such as pain. Previous results suggest that poor sleep exacerbates pain, which in turn negatively affects sleep. The purpose of the present study was to determine prevalence rates, comorbidity, and role of depression as a factor of moderating the relationship between sleep and physical complaints in German university students. SAMPLES AND METHODS: In total, 2443 German university students (65% women) completed a web survey. Self-report measures included the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, three modules of the Patient Health Questionnaire, and a questionnaire on the functional somatic syndromes (FSSs). RESULTS: More than one-third (36.9%) reported poor sleep as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Somatoform syndrome was identified in 23.5%, and the prevalence of any FSS was 12.8%. Self-reported sleep quality, sleep onset latency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medications, and daytime dysfunctioning were significant predictors of somatoform syndrome, whereas sleep efficiency and sleep duration influenced somatic complaints indirectly. Moderate correlations were found between stress, anxiety, somatoform syndrome, depression, and overall sleep quality. The effect of somatic complaints on sleep quality was associated with the severity of depression. Anxiety shows direct effects on somatization and depression but only indirect associations with sleep quality.",2017,2017/05,J Pain Res,10,,1189-1199,28572738.0,10.2147/JPR.S125421,,#595,Schlarb 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Differences between self- and peer-rated likability in relation to social anxiety and depression in adolescents with mild intellectual disabilities,"Klein, A. M.; Houtkamp, E.

Unfortunately, there are only a few studies that focus on examining processes underlying social anxiety and depression in these adolescents. AIMS: The aim was to examine the differences between self- and peer-rated likability in relation to social anxiety and depression in the classroom environment. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: 631 normative non-clinical adolescents with MBID completed questionnaires to measure social anxiety, depression, and the estimation of their own likability by peers. Peer-reported likability was derived from peer-rating scales on likability. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Adolescents with higher levels of social anxiety significantly rated their own likability as lower than their non-anxious peers. However, socially adolescents were equally liked by their peers. Adolescents with higher levels of depression were significantly less liked by their peers, but still underestimated their own likability than adolescents with lower levels of depression. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Social anxiety and depression are linked to a biased interpretation of likability, but only depression is linked to actually being less liked by peers.

"Inferring other people's states of mind: Comparison across social anxiety, body dysmorphic, and obsessive-compulsive disorders","Buhlmann, U.; Wacker, R.; Dziobek, I.","BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are characterized by fears of negative evaluation by others (related to one's own incompetence or flawed appearance, respectively). Previous research has shown that individuals with SAD and BDD exhibit difficulty identifying facial expressions and interpretive biases for threat in social situations. The current study aimed at further investigating social cognition in SAD, BDD, and mentally healthy controls (35 individuals per group, respectively). Further, 35 individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as a clinical control group not characterized by evaluation fears were included. METHODS: The Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) was applied. It consists of 45 video sequences depicting interactions among four people at a dinner party. Participants are instructed to evaluate each scenario with respect to the characters' emotions, thoughts, and intentions from a bystander perspective (i.e. other-referent context). RESULTS: Only the socially anxious groups (SAD and BDD) were overall less accurate than the other groups in correctly interpreting the social situations, whereas no difference was obtained between the OCD and the control group. Further analyses indicated that the SAD and BDD groups were less accurate in identifying other people's thoughts and intentions, whereas, again, no difference was observed between the OCD and control groups. In addition, the SAD group was less accurate in inferring thoughts and intentions than the OCD group. Interestingly, the groups did not differ with respect to identifying other people's emotions. CONCLUSIONS: These results mostly confirm existing cognitive-behavioral models of SAD and BDD emphasizing that biased interpretation of what others think or intend is one of the key factors maintaining social anxiety and appearance-related concerns. Our study shows that this bias generalizes to social situations in which individuals take a third-person observer perspective.",2015,Aug,J Anxiety Disord,34,,107-13,26218178.0,10.1016/j.janxdis.2015.06.003,,#598,Buhlmann 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Familial Accumulation of Social Anxiety Symptoms and Maladaptive Emotion Regulation,"Asbrand, J.; Svaldi, J.; Kramer, M.; Breuninger, C.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.","BACKGROUND: Social anxiety is thought to be strongly related to maladaptive emotion regulation (ER). As social anxiety symptoms accumulate in families, we hypothesize that maladaptive ER is also more prevalent in families with anxious children. Thus, we analyze differences in emotion regulation of both child and mother in relation to social anxiety, as well as both their ER strategies in dealing with anxiety. Further, a positive relation between child and maternal ER strategies is assumed. METHOD: Children (aged 9 to 13 years) with social, anxiety disorder (SAD; n = 25) and healthy controls (HC, n = 26) as well as their mothers completed several measures of social anxiety and trait ER strategies towards anxiety. As ER of children is still in development, age is considered as covariate. RESULTS: SAD children and their mothers reported more maladaptive ER strategies than HC dyads. Maternal maladaptive ER was related negatively to child adaptive ER which was further moderated by the child's age. DISCUSSION: Maladaptive ER strategies seem to contribute to the exacerbation of social anxiety in both mother and child. Mothers reporting maladaptive ER may have difficulties supporting their child in coping with social anxiety while simultaneously also experiencing heightened levels of anxiety. Deeper understanding of interactional processes between mothers and children during development can assist the comprehension of factors maintaining SAD.

The trauma of peer abuse: effects of relational peer victimization and social anxiety disorder on physiological and affective reactions to social exclusion,"Iffland, B.; Sansen, L. M.; Catani, C.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND: Social exclusion elicits emotional distress, negative mood, and physiological stress. Recent studies showed that these effects were more intense and persisting in socially anxious subjects. The present study examined whether the abnormal reactions of socially anxious subjects can be traced back to previous experiences of relational peer victimization during childhood and adolescence. METHODS: Participants (N = 74) were patients with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder as well as healthy controls. The patient and control groups were subdivided into two subgroups according to the subject's reports about previous relational peer victimization. Immediate and delayed physiological (skin conductance level and heart rate) and affective reactions to a simulated social exclusion in a ball-toss game (Cyberball) were recorded. RESULTS: Overall, subjects' immediate reactions to social exclusion were an increase in skin conductance and a reduction of positive affect. Regardless of the diagnostic status, subjects with a history of relational peer victimization showed a more intense self-reported affective change that was accompanied by a blunted skin conductance response. However, the mood of the subjects with a history of peer victimization recovered during a 15 min waiting period. A diagnosis of social anxiety disorder did not affect the reactions to social exclusion on any measure. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that stress reactions to social exclusion depend more on previous experiences of peer victimization than on a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. The findings indicate that memories of negative social experiences can determine the initial stress reaction to social threats.",2014,2014/03/18,Front Psychiatry,5,,26,24672491.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2014.00026,,#601,Iffland 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Rapid heartbeat, but dry palms: reactions of heart rate and skin conductance levels to social rejection","Iffland, B.; Sansen, L. M.; Catani, C.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND: Social rejection elicits negative mood, emotional distress, and neural activity in networks that are associated with physical pain. However, studies assessing physiological reactions to social rejection are rare and results of these studies were found to be ambiguous. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. METHODS: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. RESULTS: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. In addition, results revealed gender-specific response patterns suggesting that sample characteristics such as differences in gender may account for ambiguous findings of physiological reactions to social rejection.",2014,2014/08/29,Front Psychol,5,,956,25221535.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00956,,#602,Iffland 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Social Rhythm and Mental Health: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,"Margraf, J.; Lavallee, K.; Zhang, X.; Schneider, S.","BACKGROUND: Social rhythm refers to the regularity with which one engages in social activities throughout the week, and has established links with bipolar disorder, as well as some links with depression and anxiety. The aim of the present study is to examine social rhythm and its relationship to various aspects of health, including physical health, negative mental health, and positive mental health. METHOD: Questionnaire data were obtained from a large-scale multi-national sample of 8095 representative participants from the U.S., Russia, and Germany. RESULTS: Results indicated that social rhythm irregularity is related to increased reporting of health problems, depression, anxiety, and stress. In contrast, greater regularity is related to better overall health state, life satisfaction, and positive mental health. The effects are generally small in size, but hold even when controlling for gender, marital status, education, income, country, and social support.

Catastrophizing misinterpretations predict somatoform-related symptoms and new onsets of somatoform disorders,"Woud, M. L.; Zhang, X. C.; Becker, E. S.; Zlomuzica, A.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: Somatoform disorders are characterized by multiple recurring symptoms that resemble physical illnesses but defy medical explanation. Psychological models suggest that catastrophizing misinterpretations of harmless physical symptoms play a key role. However, the question of whether such biases predict somatoform-related symptoms and the onset of somatoform disorders has not been adressed. Hence, the aim of the present study was to further advance our understanding of the role of catastrophizing misinterpretations in somatoform disorders. METHODS: In the present study, we used data from the Dresden Predictor Study (N=1538), in which an epidemiologic sample of young German women was tested at two time points approximately 17 months apart. Each participant completed a diagnostic interview, an interpretation questionnaire for somatoform and hypochondriacal symptoms, and three measures of such symptomatology: somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), Whiteley Index (WI), Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ). RESULTS: At follow-up, 33 women were diagnosed with new onsets of lifetime somatoform disorder. Results showed that catastrophizing misinterpretations assessed at baseline were predictive of somatoform-related symptoms at follow-up, i.e., symptoms assessed with the WI and BSQ. Moreover, catastrophizing misinterpretations were predictive of new onsets of somatoform disorders, even after controlling for general threat-related misinterpretations and indices of somatoform symptoms (i.e., SCL-90-R and BSQ). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective, longitudinal study to demonstrate that catastrophizing misinterpretations have incremental validity as predictors of future somatoform-related symptomatology and somatoform disorders.",2016,Feb,J Psychosom Res,81,,31-7,26800636.0,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2015.12.005,,#605,Woud 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
How individuals change during internet-based interventions for depression: A randomized controlled trial comparing standardized and individualized feedback,"Zagorscak, P.; Heinrich, M.; Bohn, J.; Stein, J.; Knaevelsrud, C.","BACKGROUND: Standardized and individualized Internet-based interventions (IBI) for depression yield significant symptom improvements. However, change patterns during standardized or individualized IBI are unknown. Identifying subgroups that experience different symptom courses during IBI and their characteristics is vital for improving response. METHODS: Mildly to moderately depressed individuals according to self-report (N = 1,089) were randomized to receive module-wise feedback that was either standardized or individualized by a counselor within an otherwise identical cognitive-behavioral IBI for depression (seven modules over six weeks). Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and before each module (Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9). Other individual characteristics (self-report) and the presence of an affective disorder (structured clinical interview) were assessed at baseline. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify and compare subgroups with discernable change patterns and associated client variables across conditions. RESULTS: Model comparisons suggest equal change patterns in both conditions. Across conditions, a group of immediate (62.5%) and a group of delayed improvers (37.5%) were identified. Immediate improvers decreased their PHQ-9 score by 5.5 points from pre to post, with 33% of improvement occurring before treatment commenced. Delayed improvers were characterized by stable symptom severity during the first two modules and smaller overall symptom decrease (3.4 points). Higher treatment expectations, a current major depressive disorder (interview), and lower social support were associated with delayed improvement. CONCLUSION: Internet-based interventions for depression with individualized and with standardized feedback lead to comparable patterns of change. Expectation management and bolstering of social support are promising strategies for individuals that are at risk for delayed improvement.",2020,Jan,Brain Behav,10,1,e01484,31777204.0,10.1002/brb3.1484,,#606,Zagorscak 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Assessment of attachment disorder symptoms in foster children: comparing diagnostic assessment tools,"Kliewer-Neumann, J.

METHODS: In the current study, several assessments for attachment disorder symptoms are used within a German sample of foster children after being exposed to neglect and maltreatment in their biological families. The symptoms were assessed with four established assessment methods based on both parents' report and behavioral observation: The Rating for Infant Stranger Engagement, the Stranger at the Door, the Disturbances of Attachment Interview and the Reactive Attachment Disorder Questionnaire. RESULTS: The foster care sample showed symptoms of both the inhibited and the disinhibited attachment disorder. The degree of symptoms is comparable to previous findings. The results of the different tools investigating the disinhibited type of attachment disorder are correlated to each other, but do not overlap. CONCLUSIONS: Although all approaches are based on the clinical criteria of the DSM-IV, the assessments do not coincide. Each tool provides a different point of view on the symptoms, so a multi methodical approach for assessing attachment disorder symptoms should be implemented.

Acute stress differentially affects spatial configuration learning in high and low cortisol-responding healthy adults,"Meyer, T.; Smeets, T.; Giesbrecht, T.; Quaedflieg, C. W.; Merckelbach, H.","BACKGROUND: Stress and stress hormones modulate memory formation in various ways that are relevant to our understanding of stress-related psychopathology, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Particular relevance is attributed to efficient memory formation sustained by the hippocampus and parahippocampus. This process is thought to reduce the occurrence of intrusions and flashbacks following trauma, but may be negatively affected by acute stress. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the efficiency of visuo-spatial processing and learning based on the hippocampal area is related to PTSD symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The current study investigated the effect of acute stress on spatial configuration learning using a spatial contextual cueing task (SCCT) known to heavily rely on structures in the parahippocampus. METHOD: Acute stress was induced by subjecting participants (N = 34) to the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST). Following a counterbalanced within-subject approach, the effects of stress and the ensuing hormonal (i.e., cortisol) activity on subsequent SCCT performance were compared to SCCT performance following a no-stress control condition. RESULTS: Acute stress did not impact SCCT learning overall, but opposing effects emerged for high versus low cortisol responders to the MAST. Learning scores following stress were reduced in low cortisol responders, while high cortisol-responding participants showed improved learning. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of stress on spatial configuration learning were moderated by the magnitude of endogenous cortisol secretion. These findings suggest a possible mechanism by which cortisol responses serve an adaptive function during stress and trauma, and this may prove to be a promising route for future research in this area.",2013,2013/05/02,Eur J Psychotraumatol,4,1,,23671762.0,10.3402/ejpt.v4i0.19854,,#608,Meyer 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

T.; Rojas, R.","BACKGROUND: Stress-related alterations in the regulation of several endocrine systems, including the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and -gonadal (HPG) axes and the endocannabinoid system are proposed to be involved in the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, this study examines whether altered concentrations of glucocorticoids, testosterone, endocannabinoids, and related N-acylethanolamines accumulated in hair are present in MDD. METHODS: Female participants (range: 19-59, Mdn = 30.5 years) were recruited, including n = 21 with a current MDD episode and n = 27 nondepressed controls without any current mental disorder. Weight-standardized samples of 3 cm hair segments were analyzed which equals to three months of retrospectively assessed biomarkers in hair. Concentrations of cortisol, cortisone, testosterone, endocannabinoids (i.e., anandamide [AEA], 2-arachidonylglycerol [2-AG]), and selected N-acylethanolamines (i.e., stearoylethanolamide [SEA], oleoylethanolamide [OEA], palmitoylethanolamide [PEA]) were measured using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Female MDD patients exhibited lower cortisol and cortisone levels in hair than nondepressed controls, whereas the hair concentrations of endocannabinoids, N-acylethanolamines, and testosterone did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results add to the heterogeneous body of findings on alterations in hair-stored glucocorticoids and endocannabinoids in MDD.

Yet, little is known about factors that buffer individuals against the development of suicide ideation. Aim: In a long-term follow-up study design, it was investigated whether positive mental health, that is, high levels of subjective and psychological well-being, buffers the association between stressful life events and suicide ideation. Method: A total of 126 German students (80.2% female; age: M = 24.29, SD = 5.21) were assessed at a baseline evaluation and again 24 months later. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. Results: Linear hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Positive mental health was considered to moderate the impact of stressful life events on suicide ideation - controlling for age and gender. Limitations: Current results are limited to university students.

E.","BACKGROUND: Studies in immigrant youth have suggested differences in parenting patterns by immigration status. Knowledge of variation in recalled parenting pattern and its distinctive impact on mental health in adult immigrants, however, is limited. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to investigate similarities and differences in recalled maternal and paternal rearing behavior and its association with depressiveness in adult 1st generation immigrants compared to non-immigrants. METHODS: Seven hundred and forty-three 1st generation immigrants (M = 57.4, SD = 10.1 years) and 6518 non-immigrants (M = 60.3, SD = 10.7 years) participated in a population-based study. Regarding countries of origin, the largest subgroups were immigrants from Eastern-Europe, Former-SU, and Arabic-Islamic countries. All participants completed the ultra-short version of The Recalled Parental Rearing Behavior-questionnaire and the PHQ-9 assessing depressiveness. Multiple linear regressions with depressiveness as outcome variable were analyzed separately for each facet of parental rearing behavior adjusting for socio-demographic and migration-related variables. RESULTS: In addition to differences in depressiveness and socioeconomic status, 1st generation immigrants recalled both their mothers and fathers as more controlling and overprotecting than non-immigrants. Parental emotional warmth was negatively associated with depressiveness across all groups. The relationship between parental control, respectively parental rejection and depressiveness, however, varied in direction and severity between the groups.

"Associations between patient personality, symptomatic change and therapy dropout","Immel, N.; Dagnino, P.; Hunger-Schoppe, C.","BACKGROUND: Studies show that 16% to 77% of psychotherapy patients abandon therapy within the first sessions. The aim of this study is to examine how patient personality variables, specifically the patients' structural integration and the personality traits dependency and self-criticism, are associated with symptomatic change and therapy dropout. METHOD: We analysed data from 96 patients (age: M = 30.56, SD = 11.39; 78.5% women; 44.6% students, 28.3% employees). A hierarchical logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine whether patients' structural integration (assessed via the OPD-SQ) and their level of dependency and self-criticism (DEQ) can predict therapy dropout. In addition, a multiple regression was used to analyse how these variables affect symptomatic change (OQ-45.2 symptom subscale). RESULTS: The interaction of structural integration level and dependency best predicts therapy dropout. For the prediction of symptomatic change, both structural integration and dependency were significant. However, their interaction showed no significant results. DISCUSSION: The patient's structural integration was associated to both symptomatic change and dropout.

Disentangling substance use and related problems: urgency predicts substance-related problems beyond the degree of use,"Hildebrandt, M. K.; Dieterich, R.; Endrass, T.","BACKGROUND: Substance use disorders are reliably associated with high impulsivity and sensation seeking. Importantly, both precede problematic substance use, implicating them as risk factors. Individuals with substance use disorders show variable degrees of substance use (combined quantity and frequency) and substance-related problems and differ in both aspects from healthy controls. Dimensional research has indicated differential associations of impulsivity-related traits as well as sensation seeking with the degree of substance use and substance-related problems. The current study aimed to clarify whether impulsivity-related traits and sensation seeking predict substance-related problems above and beyond the degree of substance use and are thus specifically linked to problems, the dimension that characterizes substance use disorders. METHOD: We assessed impulsivity-related traits and sensation seeking using self-report, as well as delay discounting, a behavioral indicator of impulsivity, in a sample of 258 substance-using adults. RESULTS: Sensation seeking and impulsivity-related traits significantly predicted the degree of substance use, with sensation seeking explaining the largest portion of variance. In contrast, self-reported impulsivity, in particular when experiencing negative emotions (urgency), but not sensation seeking or delay discounting, predicted substance-related problems when controlling for the degree of substance use. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that urgency, but not sensation seeking, may be specifically linked to substance-related problems and thus especially relevant for substance use disorders. Taken together, this study underlines the necessity to assess and control for the degree of substance use in risk factor research concerning substance-related problems. Thus, it may inform future research improving targeted prevention and therapy.",2021,May 7,BMC Psychiatry,21,1,242,33962614.0,10.1186/s12888-021-03240-z,,#614,Hildebrandt 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The Effects of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy added to Treatment as Usual on suicidal ideation in chronic depression: Results of a randomized-clinical trial,"Forkmann, T.; Brakemeier, E. L.; Teismann, T.; Schramm, E.; Michalak, J.","BACKGROUND: Suicidal ideation (SI) is common in chronic depression, but only limited evidence exists for the assumption that psychological treatments for depression are effective for reducing SI. METHODS: In the present study, the effects of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; group version) plus treatment-as-usual (TAU: individual treatment by either a psychiatrist or a licensed psychotherapist, including medication when indicated) and Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP; group version) plus TAU on SI was compared to TAU alone in a prospective, bi-center, randomized controlled trial. The sample consisted of 106 outpatients with chronic depression. RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses revealed different results, depending on whether SI was assessed via self-report (Beck Depression Inventory suicide item) or via clinician rating (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item). Whereas significant reduction of SI emerged when assessed via clinician rating in the MBCT and CBASP group, but not in the TAU group while controlling for changes in depression, there was no significant effect of treatment on SI when assessed via self-report. LIMITATIONS: SI was measured with only two single items. CONCLUSIONS: Because all effects were of small to medium size and were independent of effects from other depression symptoms, the present results warrant the application of such psychotherapeutical treatment strategies like MBCT and CBASP for SI in patients with chronic depression.",2016,Aug,J Affect Disord,200,,51-7,27128357.0,10.1016/j.jad.2016.01.047,,#615,Forkmann 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Suicidal ideation in primary care patients suffering from panic disorder with or without agoraphobia,"Teismann, T.; Lukaschek, K.; Hiller, T.

The present study investigated rates of suicidal ideation and risk factors for suicidal ideation in a sample of primary care patients suffering from panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. METHODS: A total of N = 296 patients [n = 215 (72.6%) women; age: M = 43.99, SD = 13.44] were investigated. Anxiety severity, anxiety symptoms, avoidance behavior, comorbid depression diagnosis, severity of depression, age, sex, employment status, living situation and frequency of visits at the general practitioner were considered as risk factors of suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Suicidal ideation was experienced by 25% of the respondents. In a logistic regression analysis, depression diagnosis and depression severity emerged as significant risk factors for suicidal ideation. Anxiety measures were not associated with suicidal ideation.

"Suicide Attempters, Suicide Ideators, and Non-Ideators","Teismann, T.; Paashaus, L.; Siegmann, P.; Nyhuis, P.; Wolter, M.; Willutzki, U.","Background: Suicide ideation is a prerequisite for suicide attempts. However, the majority of ideators will never act on their thoughts. It is therefore crucial to understand factors that differentiate those who consider suicide from those who make suicide attempts. Aim: Our aim was to investigate the role of protective factors in differentiating non-ideators, suicide ideators, and suicide attempters. Method: Inpatients without suicide ideation (n = 32) were compared with inpatients with current suicide ideation (n = 37) and with inpatients with current suicide ideation and a lifetime history of suicide attempts (n = 26) regarding positive mental health, self-esteem, trust in higher guidance, social support, and reasons for living. Results: Non-ideators reported more positive mental health, social support, reasons for living, and self-esteem than suicide ideators and suicide attempters did. No group differences were found regarding trust in higher guidance. Suicide ideators and suicide attempters did not differ regarding any of the study variables. Limitations: Results stem from a cross-sectional study of suicide attempts; thus, neither directionality nor generalizability to fatal suicide attempts can be determined. Conclusion: Various protective factors are best characterized to distinguish ideators from nonsuicidal inpatients.

The present study investigated factors associated with the remission of suicidal thoughts in a representative sample of woman aged 18-24 years. METHODS: A total of 1389 women were interviewed at a baseline assessment and again 17 months later. Social support, satisfaction with life, self-efficacy and positive mental health were considered as predictors of remission of suicidal thoughts - controlling for severity of psychopathology. RESULTS: Remission of suicidal thoughts was experienced by 67.4% of the respondents, whereas 32.6% continued to have suicide ideation at both assessments. In multiple logistic regression analyses, social support and positive mental health emerged as significant predictors of remission.

Momentary interpersonal processes of suicidal surges in borderline personality disorder,"Kaurin, A.; Dombrovski, A. Y.; Hallquist, M. N.; Wright, A. G. C.","BACKGROUND: Suicide rates are high in borderline personality disorder (BPD) where interpersonal problems trigger intense affective dysregulation and impulses to act on suicidal thoughts. To date, however, no study has examined how interpersonal stressors contribute to momentary within-person links among affect and impulsivity with suicidal ideation (SI), and how those links vary over time in people's daily lives. METHODS: A total of 153 individuals diagnosed with BPD and 52 healthy controls completed a 21-day ecological momentary assessment protocol. Of these 153 individuals with BPD, 105 had a history of suicide attempts. Multilevel structural equation modeling was used to examine dynamic links among interpersonal perceptions, affect, state impulsivity, and suicidal intent. RESULTS: Aggregated across interactions, lower perceived warmth in others was associated with SI. This direct relationship, however, did not extend to momentary within-person associations. Instead, interpersonal conflicts were linked to SI indirectly via greater negative affect and lower positive affect. While a robust within-person link between interpersonal perceptions and impulsivity emerged, impulsivity did not account for the relationship between interpersonal perceptions and SI. CONCLUSION: This intensive longitudinal study illustrates momentary interpersonal signatures of an emerging suicidal crisis. Among people with BPD at high risk for suicide, interpersonal triggers initiate a cascade of affective dysregulation, which in turn gives rise to SI.",2022,Oct,Psychol Med,52,13,2702-2712,33298227.0,10.1017/S0033291720004791,,#619,Kaurin 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Perseverative Thinking about Suicide Questionnaire (PTSQ): Validation of a new measure to assess suicide-specific rumination,"Holler, I.; Teismann, T.; Forkmann, T.","BACKGROUND: Suicide-specific rumination has been shown to be associated with lifetime suicide attempts as well as suicide intent and might be an important risk factor for the transition from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior. Based on this background, the wording of the items of an often-used self-report measure assessing core characteristics of rumination was adapted to assess specifically suicide-specific rumination. METHODS: The entire study sample comprised N = 1689 participants from the German healthcare sector. A total of 721 participants with a history of suicidal ideation (68% female; M(age) = 30.63, SD(age) = 8.41, range: 18-81 years) who had completed five measures assessing suicide-specific rumination, suicidal ideation, depression, hopelessness, and resilience were included for the present examination. Factorial validity (Exploratory [EFA] to determine the appropriate number of factors and confirmatory factor analyses [CFA] after randomly splitting of the sample to validate the EFA solution), construct validity, and reliability were evaluated. RESULTS: The EFA revealed a one-factor solution consisting of four items, which could be confirmed within a CFA (RMSR = 0.006; RMSEA = 0.039; CFI = 0.999; TLI = 0.998). Internal consistency was excellent with Cronbachs alpha = 0.93. Construct validity was given with moderate to high positive correlations with suicidal ideation (0.76), depression (0.55), and hopelessness (0.38) and negative correlation with resilience (-0.31). Participants with recent suicidal ideation and/or lifetime suicide attempt reported significantly more suicide-specific rumination than those with only lifetime suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: A new 4-item measure for suicide-specific rumination was developed and could be shown to be a reliable and valid instrument in a large German sample. Results emphasize the potential importance of suicide-specific rumination for the understanding of trajectories of suicidal ideation and suicide risk assessments.",2022,Jan,Compr Psychiatry,112,,152287,34781079.0,10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152287,,#621,Holler 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Negative mood-induction modulates default mode network resting-state functional connectivity in chronic depression,"Renner, F.; Siep, N.; Arntz, A.; van de Ven, V.; Peeters, Fpml; Quaedflieg, Cwem; Huibers, M. J. H.","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sad mood on default mode network (DMN) resting-state connectivity in persons with chronic major depressive disorder (cMDD). METHODS: Participants with a diagnosis of cMDD (n=18) and age, gender and education level matched participants without a diagnosis of depression (n=18) underwent a resting-state fMRI scan, before and after a sad mood induction. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was used as a seed for DMN functional connectivity across the two resting-state measurements. RESULTS: Mood ratings decreased in both groups following the sad mood induction procedure. PCC connectivity with the parahippocampal gyrus, the superior temporal gyrus and the anterior inferior temporal cortex increased in cMDD patients following the sad mood induction, whereas it decreased in non-patient controls. PCC connectivity with the anterior prefrontal cortex and the precuneus decreased in cMDD patients following the sad mood induction, whereas it increased in non-patient controls. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size and lack of a clinical control group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are in line with neurobiological models of depression suggesting that the observed changes in DMN connectivity following the sad mood induction might reflect a failure to exert cognitive control over negative memory retrieval in patients with cMDD.",2017,Jan 15,J Affect Disord,208,,590-596,27810271.0,10.1016/j.jad.2016.10.022,,#623,Renner 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Scales for assessing therapeutic adherence and competence in dialectical behaviour therapy for PTSD: development and analysis of psychometric properties,"Steil, R.; Muller-Engelmann, M.; Stangier, U.; Priebe, K.; Fydrich, T.; Weiss, J.; Dittmann, C.","BACKGROUND: The assessment of therapeutic adherence and competence is essential to understand mechanisms that contribute to treatment outcome. Nevertheless, their assessment is often neglected in psychotherapy research. AIMS/OBJECTIVE: To develop an adherence and a treatment-specific competence rating scale for Dialectical Behaviour Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (DBT-PTSD), and to examine their psychometric properties. Global cognitive behavioural therapeutic competence and disorder-specific therapeutic competence were assessed using already existing scales to confirm their psychometric properties in our sample of patients with PTSD and emotion regulation difficulties. METHOD: Two rating scales were developed using an inductive procedure. 155 videotaped therapy sessions from a multicenter randomised controlled trial were rated by trained raters using these scales, 40 randomly chosen videotapes involving eleven therapists and fourteen patients were doubly rated by two raters. RESULTS: Both the adherence scale (Patient-level ICC = .98; alpha(s )= .65; alpha (p)( )= .75) and the treatment-specific competence scale (Patient-level ICC = .98; alpha(s )= .78; alpha (p)( )= .82) for DBT-PTSD showed excellent interrater - and good reliability on the patient level. Content validity, including relevance and appropriateness of all items, was confirmed by experts in DBT-PTSD for the new treatment-specific competence scale.

Externalizing problems mediate the relation between teacher and peer violence and lower school performance,"Masath, F. B.; Scharpf, F.; Dumke, L.; Hecker, T.","BACKGROUND: The association between children's exposure to family violence and poor academic outcomes is well-established. Less is known about how exposure to violence in the school context, i.e., by teachers and by peers, affects academic functioning. Moreover, the role of children's mental health problems in this link has hardly been examined. OBJECTIVES: We examined direct and indirect associations between children's experiences of violence by teachers and peers and children's mental health and school functioning while controlling for children's experiences of parental violence. PARTICIPANTS: Using a multistage random sampling approach, we obtained a representative sample of 914 students (50.5 % girls, M(age) = 12.58 years) from 12 primary schools in Tanzania. METHODS: In structured interviews, students' experiences of violence and mental health problems were assessed. Students' academic performance and absenteeism were documented using school records. Associations were examined using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Experiences of more teacher and peer violence were each significantly associated with higher externalizing problems (teachers: beta = 0.27 [95 %-CI: 0.12, 0.47]; peers: beta = 0.17, [95 %-CI: 0.07, 0.32]). Higher externalizing problems were significantly associated with poorer academic performance (beta = -0.13, [95 %-CI: -0.23, -0.02]), implying significant indirect associations between students' experiences of teacher violence (beta = -0.04, [95 %-CI: -0.08, -0.01]) and peer violence (beta = -0.02, [95 %-CI: -0.05, -0.01]) and their academic performance via externalizing problems.

Longitudinal change instead of baseline testosterone predicts depressive symptoms,"Kische, H.; Pieper, L.; Venz, J.; Klotsche, J.; Marz, W.; Koch-Gromus, U.; Pittrow, D.; Lehnert, H.; Silber, S.; Stalla, G. K.; Zeiher, A. M.; Wittchen, H. U.; Haring, R.","BACKGROUND: The association between total testosterone (T) and depression mostly relies on single sex hormone assessment and remains inconclusive. Thus, we investigated the comparative predictive performance of baseline T and change in T with development of depressive symptoms and incident depressive episodes. METHODS: We used data from 6493 primary care patients (2653 men and 3840 women) of the DETECT study (Diabetes Cardiovascular Risk-Evaluation: Targets and Essential Data for Commitment of Treatment), including four-year follow-up, repeated immunoassay-based measurement of serum T and depressive symptoms assessed by the Depression Screening Questionnaire (DSQ). Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of baseline T and one-year change in T with prevalent and incident depression were investigated using age- and multivariable-adjusted regression models. RESULTS: Baseline T showed no association with prevalent or incident depressive symptoms and episodes in both sexes. In men, a positive change in T (higher T at one-year follow-up compared to baseline) was associated with a lower burden of depressive symptoms (beta-coefficient per unit change in T: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.31 to -0.04) and lower risk of incident depressive symptoms (odds ratio per unit change in T: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.72-0.98) at four-year follow-up. In women, the association of T change with incident depressive episodes was rendered non-significant after multivariable adjustment.

[Associations of maternal educational background with health and health behavior in infants],"Meyrose, A. K.; Wustner, A.; Otto, C.; Lampert, T.; Ravens-Sieberer, U.","BACKGROUND: The basis for healthy development is established during the first years of one's life. In this early phase, parents can significantly influence the health conditions under which their child grows up. Parental education can play a key role in this regard. This study examines the association of maternal education with health and health behavior in infants. METHODS: A subsample of the representative German KiGGS study (Wave 1, 2009-2012) on the health of children and adolescents was investigated. Data from 1727 mothers who reported on health-specific characteristics of their infants (0 to 2 years), on their own educational background, and on characteristics of the family were analyzed. The influence of maternal education on indices of health and health behavior in infants was investigated by means of logistic regression; additional predictors were considered in regression models. RESULTS: Higher maternal education was associated with better health behavior, but not with overall infant health. The impact of maternal education on health behavior remained significant when considering other predictors (financial worries, low maternal age at childbirth, premature birth/low birth weight). Overall, low maternal education was accompanied by an accumulation of additional risks. CONCLUSIONS: Higher maternal education can help infants have a good start in their lives. The impact of poor health behavior on infant health may not become apparent until later in their lives.

Comparing the Efficacy of CBASP with Two Versions of CBT for Depression in a Routine Care Center: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Rief, W.; Bleichhardt, G.; Dannehl, K.; Euteneuer, F.; Wambach, K.","BACKGROUND: The cognitive-behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) was developed for the treatment of chronic, early-onset depression. However, it is unclear whether this approach can be recommended for depression in general (episodic and chronic), and no direct comparisons between CBASP with different versions of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) exist. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial compared 3 treatment conditions (all lasting 16 sessions) with a waiting list group (WL): CBASP, CBT with a focus on physical exercise (CBT-E), and CBT with a focus on pleasurable, low-energy and mindful activities (CBT-M). We included 173 patients and involved 41 therapists. Assessments were at baseline, after session 8, and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Our primary outcome Beck Depression Inventory-II indicated a general advantage of the CBT arms compared to CBASP [F(6, 154.5) = 4.2, p = 0.001], with significant contrasts in particular in favor of CBT-E. Effect sizes against WL were d = 0.91 (CBT-E), 0.87 (CBT-M), and 0.47 (CBASP). A triple interaction with an additional factor ""chronic versus episodic depression"" [F(6, 142.7) = 2.2, p = 0.048] indicated that the treatments resulted in different outcomes, with best results again for CBT-E in particular in episodic depression. Responder rates indicated significant improvements (56% in both CBT arms, 34% in the CBASP arm, 3.4% in WL; intention-to-treat samples). As compared to CBASP, response rates were significantly higher for CBT-E (OR = 2.48; 95% CI = 1.02-6.00) and CBT-M (OR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.01-6.01).

COVID-19-related distress is associated with analogue PTSD symptoms after exposure to an analogue stressor,"Friesen, E.; Michael, T.; Schafer, S. K.; Sopp, M. R.","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 was associated with an immediate increase in mental health problems in a significant percentage of the general population. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic - as a psychosocial stressor - affected the aetiological processes of mental disorders. Previous research has shown that stress potentiates associative (fear) learning and analogue symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that analogue PTSD symptoms can emerge in response to associative learning. Objective: We investigated whether distress in response to the COVID-19 outbreak support the development of intrusions and rumination after exposure to a non-COVID-19-related analogue trauma. Moreover, we examined if these effects are mediated by the strength of associative learning during analogue trauma. Method: 122 undergraduate university students participated in an online experiment between March and July 2020. They completed questionnaires measuring distress and rumination related to the COVID-19 outbreak. On a subsequent day, they went through an associative learning task, in which neutral stimuli were paired with the appearance of a highly aversive film clip. Subjective ratings were assessed as indicators of associative learning. On the next day, participants documented film-related intrusions and rumination. Results: COVID-19-related distress but not rumination was associated with post-film intrusion and rumination load. These effects were mediated by associative learning. Conclusions: The current findings are in line with the assumptions that stress enhanced both associative learning and PTSD symptoms. Specifically, they indicate that prolonged psychosocial stress - like during the COVID-19 outbreak - is linked to individual differences in memory processing of aversive events. Further confirmatory research is needed to replicate these results.",2022,2022/11/04,Eur J Psychotraumatol,13,2,2127185,36353527.0,10.1080/20008066.2022.2127185,,#632,Friesen 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Daily Activities, Cognitions, and Stress in a Lonely and Distressed Population: Temporal Dynamic Network Analysis","Haucke, M.; Heinz, A.; Liu, S.; Heinzel, S.","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown measures impacted mental health worldwide. However, the temporal dynamics of causal factors that modulate mental health during lockdown are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand how a COVID-19 lockdown changes the temporal dynamics of loneliness and other factors affecting mental health. This is the first study that compares network characteristics between lockdown stages to prioritize mental health intervention targets. METHODS: We combined ecological momentary assessments with wrist-worn motion tracking to investigate the mechanism and changes in network centrality of symptoms and behaviors before and during lockdown. A total of 258 participants who reported at least mild loneliness and distress were assessed 8 times a day for 7 consecutive days over a 213-day period from August 8, 2020, through March 9, 2021, in Germany, covering a ""no-lockdown"" and a ""lockdown"" stage. COVID-19-related worry, information-seeking, perceived restriction, and loneliness were assessed by digital visual analog scales ranging from 0 to 100. Social activity was assessed on a 7-point Likert scale, while physical activity was recorded from wrist-worn actigraphy devices. RESULTS: We built a multilevel vector autoregressive model to estimate dynamic networks. To compare network characteristics between a no-lockdown stage and a lockdown stage, we performed permutation tests. During lockdown, loneliness had the highest impact within the network, as indicated by its centrality index (ie, an index to identify variables that have a strong influence on the other variables). Moreover, during lockdown, the centrality of loneliness significantly increased. Physical activity contributed to a decrease in loneliness amid the lockdown stage. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown increased the central role of loneliness in triggering stress-related behaviors and cognition. Our study indicates that loneliness should be prioritized in mental health interventions during lockdown. Moreover, physical activity can serve as a buffer for loneliness amid social restrictions.",2022,Mar 17,J Med Internet Res,24,3,e32598,35191843.0,10.2196/32598,,#634,Haucke 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Associations of Depressive Symptoms, COVID-19-Related Stressors, and Coping Strategies.

Prevention measures like physical distancing have burdened the general population, especially in highly urbanized areas. However, little is known about the associations between pandemic-related stressors, coping strategies, and depressive symptoms in highly urbanized vs. less urbanized environments. METHODS: Participants were recruited in a cross-sectional online survey in Germany. Propensity score matching yielded a matched sample of city (n = 453) and town (n = 453) inhabitants. Depressive symptoms, COVID-19-related stressors, and coping strategies were compared between cities and towns. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine associations between pandemic-related stressors and depressive symptoms for the two groups separately. RESULTS: City inhabitants showed significantly higher depression scores than town inhabitants (t = 2.11, df = 897.95, p = 0.035). Seven coping strategies were more often used by the city sample. Depressive symptoms were associated with ""restricted physical social contact"" and ""difficult housing conditions"" (adjusted R (2)= 0.19, F ([9,443]) = 12.52, p < 0.001) in city inhabitants, and with ""fear of infection"" and ""difficult housing conditions"" (adjusted R (2)= 0.20, F ([9,443]) = 13.50, p < 0.001) in town inhabitants. LIMITATIONS: The data were collected at the end of the first wave and represent a snapshot without causal inferences. Pandemic-related stressors were measured with a newly developed scale. CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms, perceived stressors, and approach/avoidance coping strategies differed between city vs. town inhabitants. These differences should be considered in policy-making and mental health care.",2021,2022/01/27,Front Psychiatry,12,,791312,35153860.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2021.791312,,#636,Meyer 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"In the Face of Potential Harm: The Predictive Validity of Neural Correlates of Performance Monitoring for Perceived Risk, Stress, and Internalizing Psychopathology During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Riesel, A.; Harpfer, K.; Kathmann, N.; Klawohn, J.","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major life stressor posing serious threats not only to physical but also to mental health. To better understand mechanisms of vulnerability and identify individuals at risk for psychopathological symptoms in response to stressors is critical for prevention and intervention. The error-related negativity (ERN) has been discussed as a neural risk marker for psychopathology, and this study examined its predictive validity for perceived risk, stress, and psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 113 individuals who had participated as healthy control participants in previous electroencephalography studies (2014-2019) completed a follow-up online survey during the first COVID-19 wave in Germany. Associations of pre-pandemic ERN and correct-response negativity (CRN) with perceived risk regarding COVID-19 infection, stress, and internalizing symptoms during the pandemic were examined using mediation models. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic ERN and CRN were associated with increased perceived risk regarding a COVID-19 infection. Via this perceived risk, the ERN and CRN were associated with increased stress during the pandemic. Furthermore, risk perception and stress mediated indirect effects of ERN and CRN on internalizing psychopathology, including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, while controlling for the effects of pre-pandemic symptom levels. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, heightened pre-pandemic performance monitoring showed indirect associations with increases in psychopathological symptoms during the first COVID-19 wave via effects on perceived COVID-19 risk and stress. These results further strengthen the notion of performance monitoring event-related potentials as transdiagnostic neural risk markers and highlight the relevance of stress as a catalyst for symptom development.",2021,Dec,Biol Psychiatry Glob Open Sci,1,4,300-309,34877565.0,10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.08.004,,#637,Riesel 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Dimensional assessment of depressive severity in the elderly general population: psychometric evaluation of the PHQ-9 using Rasch Analysis,"Forkmann, T.; Gauggel, S.; Spangenberg, L.; Brahler, E.; Glaesmer, H.","BACKGROUND: The depression module of the Patient Health questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a wide-spread self-report instrument for the assessment of depression with compelling psychometric characteristics when relying on classical test theory assumptions. This study aimed at evaluating whether the PHQ-9 may be interpreted as a dimensional scale measuring depression severity in the elderly general population using Rasch analysis with special emphasis on its unidimensional structure and differential item functioning (DIF) due to gender, age, and the presence of somatic multimorbidity. METHODS: A representative sample of the elderly German general population (N=1631; age 60-85 years, 53.5% female) filled in the PHQ-9, a questionnaire about chronic medical conditions and a demographic data sheet. Unidimensionality and psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 were ascertained applying confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch analysis. RESULTS: Results revealed substantial violations of the unidimensionality of the scale: item 8 (retardation or agitation) had to be eliminated and multiple residual correlations were added. Gender-related DIF emerged for two items, and three items showed insufficient Rasch model fit. LIMITATIONS: The large sample leads to high statistical power that might technically increase the probability of detecting model misfit or DIF. The sampling procedure leads to a possible underestimation of morbidity due to the exclusion of those elderly patients living in nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that - when applied in the elderly general population - the PHQ-9 should be interpreted in terms of a diagnostic algorithm for classificatory decisions about a DSM-IV based probable diagnosis of depression rather than as a dimensional scale.",2013,Jun,J Affect Disord,148,2-3,323-30,23411025.0,10.1016/j.jad.2012.12.019,,#638,Forkmann 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Mental health and the wish to have a child: a longitudinal, cross-cultural comparison between Germany and China","Margraf, J.; Lavallee, K. L.; Zhang, X. C.; Woike, J. K.; Schneider, S.","BACKGROUND: The desire to have children has been declining globally, especially in industrialized nations. This study examines the physical health correlates, and positive and negative mental health correlates of the wish to have a child across time and in two countries. METHOD: Questionnaire data were obtained from large-scale university samples of 12,574 participants in Germany and China. RESULTS: The wish to have a child (child wish) is related to positive and negative mental health in China and, to a lesser degree, in Germany. Child wish is positively related to some aspects of mental and somatic health for Chinese women and men, negatively to depression for Chinese and German men and Chinese women, and positively to stress for German men, with generally small effects. Effects hold when controlling for age, partnership status, and family affluence. Most relationships were almost equal between women and men (in both China and Germany), and between countries with the exception of two different paths in each gender group. That is, having a partner is associated with a higher child wish in both Chinese and German female students. In China, older female students are more likely to want to have a child, while older female students in Germany are less likely to want to have a child. Neither partnership nor age predict child wish for the next year. CONCLUSION: In sum, Chinese students reported feeling more positively about having children when they were happy and healthy, with the exception that highly satisfied Chinese males report lower child wish in the next year. More depressed Chinese and German men and Chinese women reported lowered child wish, and stressed German men reported more child wish.

Psychopathology mediates between maltreatment and memory functioning in Burundian refugee youth,"Scharpf, F.; Mueller, S. C.; Masath, F. B.; Nkuba, M.; Hecker, T.","BACKGROUND: The detrimental impact of child maltreatment on children and adolescents' academic achievement and later socioeconomic wellbeing is well known. However, it is still unclear (1) whether maltreatment is actually linked to youth's long- and short-term memory deficits and (2) whether potential impairments are due to maltreatment per se or related psychopathology. OBJECTIVE: Based on the Attentional Control Theory, we investigated a mediational model in which maltreatment would be related to psychopathology (internalizing symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, posttraumatic cognitions), which would in turn be related to impaired memory functioning. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: We drew on a sample of 155 Burundian refugee youth (aged 11 to 15) currently living in refugee camps in Tanzania and at high risk of experiencing ongoing maltreatment by parents. METHODS: Youth reported on their experiences of maltreatment and psychopathology in structured clinical interviews and completed visuospatial memory tasks involving a short-term and a working memory component (Corsi Block Tapping Test) and delayed recall from long-term memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure). RESULTS: Structural equation modeling showed that psychopathology mediated the association between increased maltreatment and reduced working memory capacity (beta = -0.07, p = .02), with a trend towards mediation for short-term memory (beta = -0.05, p = .06). Higher levels of maltreatment, but not psychopathology, were directly linked to long-term memory deficits (beta = -0.20, p = .02).

Clinical effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression in routine care: A propensity score based comparison between randomized controlled trials and clinical practice,"Lutz, W.; Schiefele, A. K.; Wucherpfennig, F.; Rubel, J.; Stulz, N.","BACKGROUND: The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of depressive disorders has been demonstrated in many randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This study investigated whether for CBT similar effects can be expected under routine care conditions when the patients are comparable to those examined in RCTs. METHOD: N=574 CBT patients from an outpatient clinic were stepwise matched to the patients undergoing CBT in the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program (TDCRP). First, the exclusion criteria of the RCT were applied to the naturalistic sample of the outpatient clinic. Second, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust the remaining naturalistic sample on the basis of baseline covariate distributions. Matched samples were then compared regarding treatment effects using effect sizes, average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and recovery rates. RESULTS: CBT in the adjusted naturalistic subsample was as effective as in the RCT. However, treatments lasted significantly longer under routine care conditions. LIMITATIONS: The samples included only a limited amount of common predictor variables and stemmed from different countries. There might be additional covariates, which could potentially further improve the matching between the samples. CONCLUSIONS: CBT for depression in clinical practice might be equally effective as manual-based treatments in RCTs when they are applied to comparable patients. The fact that similar effects under routine conditions were reached with more sessions, however, points to the potential to optimize treatments in clinical practice with respect to their efficiency.",2016,Jan 1,J Affect Disord,189,,150-8,26433763.0,10.1016/j.jad.2015.08.072,,#642,Lutz 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Guided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia: Health-Economic Evaluation From the Societal and Public Health Care Perspective Alongside a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Buntrock, C.; Lehr, D.; Smit, F.; Horvath, H.; Berking, M.; Spiegelhalder, K.; Riper, H.; Ebert, D. D.","BACKGROUND: The evidence base for internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (iCBT-I) is firm; however, little is known about iCBT-I's health-economic effects. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of iCBT-I in reducing insomnia among schoolteachers. METHODS: Schoolteachers (N=128) with clinically significant insomnia symptoms and work-related rumination were randomized to guided iCBT-I or a wait list control group, both with unrestricted access to treatment as usual. Health care use, patient and family expenditures, and productivity losses were self-assessed and used for costing from a societal and a public health care perspective. Costs were related to symptom-free status (score <8 on the insomnia severity index) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Sampling error was handled using nonparametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences favoring the intervention group were found for both health outcomes (symptom-free status yes or no: beta=.30; 95% CI 0.16-0.43; QALYs: beta=.019, 95% CI 0.01-0.03). From a societal perspective, iCBT-I had a 94% probability of dominating the wait list control for both health outcomes. From a public health care perspective, iCBT-I was more effective but also more expensive than the wait list control, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro650 per symptom-free individual. In terms of QALYs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro11,285. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000 per QALY gained, the intervention's probability of being cost-effective was 89%. CONCLUSIONS: Our trial indicates that iCBT could be considered as a good value-for-money intervention for insomnia.

"The Persistence of the Impact of COVID-19-Related Distress, Mood Inertia, and Loneliness on Mental Health During a Postlockdown Period in Germany: An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study","Haucke, M.; Liu, S.; Heinzel, S.","BACKGROUND: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 increased mental health problems globally. However, little is known about mental health problems during a low-incidence period of the pandemic without strict public health measures. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate whether COVID-19-related risk factors for mental health problems persist beyond lockdown measures. We targeted a vulnerable population that is at risk of developing low mental health and assessed their daily dynamics of mood and emotion regulation after a strict lockdown. METHODS: During a postlockdown period in Germany (between August 8, 2020, and November 1, 2020), we conducted an ecological momentary assessment with 131 participants who experienced at least mild COVID-19-related distress and loneliness. To estimate negative mood inertia, we built a lag-1 three-level autoregressive model. RESULTS: We found that information exposure and active daily COVID-19 cases did not have an impact on negative mood amid a postlockdown period. However, there was a day-to-day carryover effect of negative mood. In addition, worrying about COVID-19, feeling restricted by COVID-19, and feeling lonely increased negative mood.

Treating alcohol use disorder in the absence of specialized services - evaluation of the moving inpatient Treatment Camp approach in Uganda,"Ertl, V.; Gross, M.; Mwaka, S. O.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND: The gap between service need and service provision for alcohol-related disorders is highest in resource-poor countries. However, in some of these contexts, local initiatives have developed pragmatic interventions that can be carried out with limited specialized personnel. In an uncontrolled treatment study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, safety, costs and potential effects of an innovative locally developed community-based program (the Treatment Camp) that is based on an inpatient clinic that moves from community to community. METHODS: Out of 32 treatment-seeking individuals 25 took part in the one-week Treatment Camp that included detoxification and counseling components. Re-assessments took place 5 and 12 months after their participation. We explored the course of a wide range of alcohol-related indicators, using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) as primary outcome complemented by a timeline follow-back approach and the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale. Additionally, we assessed impaired functioning, alcohol-related stigmatization, symptoms of common mental health disorders and indicators of family functioning as reported by participants' wives and children. RESULTS: All alcohol-related measures decreased significantly after the Treatment Camp and remained stable up to the 12-month-assessment with high effect sizes ranging from 0.89 to 3.49 (Hedges's g). Although 92% of the participants had lapsed at least once during the follow-up period, 67% classified below the usually applied AUDIT cutoff for hazardous drinking (>/= 8) and no one qualified for the dependent range (>/= 20) one year after treatment. Most secondary outcomes including impaired functioning, alcohol-related stigmatization, symptoms of depression and indicators of family functioning followed the same trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: We found the Treatment Camp approach to be acceptable, feasible, safe and affordable (approx. 111 USD/patient) and we could obtain preliminary evidence of its efficacy. Due to its creative combination of inpatient treatment and monitoring by medical personnel with local mobility, the Treatment Camp appears to be more accessible and inclusive than other promising interventions for alcohol dependent individuals in resource-poor contexts. Effects of the approach seem to extend to interactions within families, including a reduction of dysfunctional and violent interactions.",2021,Dec 1,BMC Psychiatry,21,1,601,34852824.0,10.1186/s12888-021-03593-5,,#645,Ertl 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
High place phenomenon: prevalence and clinical correlates in two German samples,"Teismann, T.; Brailovskaia, J.; Schaumburg, S.; Wannemuller, A.","BACKGROUND: The high place phenomenon, that is, a sudden urge to jump when in a high place, is an experience known to many people, that has rarely been studied. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of the high place phenomenon in a non-clinical and a clinical German sample. Furthermore, clinical correlates of the experience were assessed. METHODS: The study sample comprised 276 participants (67% female; M(age) = 32.08, SD(age) = 10.73) who took part in an online assessment and 94 patients (73.4% female; M(age) = 49.26, SD(age) = 13.32) suffering from clinically relevant fear of flying. Participants filled out questionnaires on experiences with the high place phenomenon, depression, anxiety, suicide ideation and anxiety sensitivity. RESULTS: The high place phenomenon was known to nearly 60% of the online sample and to 45% of the patient sample. Suicide ideation as well as anxiety sensitivity were positively associated with experiences with the high place phenomenon in the online sample. Depression, anxiety and suicide ideation were unrelated to experiences with the phenomenon in the patient sample. CONCLUSION: The high place phenomenon is commonly reported by (lifetime/current) suicide ideators. However, it is also a common experience in individuals who have never suffered from suicide ideation.

Cross-cultural adaption and psychometric investigation of the German version of the Evidence Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS-36D),"Szota, K.; Thielemann, J. F. B.; Christiansen, H.; Rye, M.; Aarons, G. A.; Barke, A.","BACKGROUND: The implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) in mental health care confers many benefits to patients, and research into factors facilitating the implementation of EBP is needed. As an important factor affecting the implementation of EBP, service providers' attitudes toward EBP emerged. The Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS-36) is an instrument with good psychometric characteristics that measures positive and ambivalent attitudes toward EBP. However, a German version is missing. The present study therefore aims to provide a validated German translation of the EBPAS-36. METHODS: The scale was translated and back-translated as recommended by standard procedures. German psychotherapists were recruited to participate in an online survey. They provided demographic and professional information, completed the EBPAS-36, the Implementation Climate Scale (ICS) and the Intention Scale for Providers (ISP). Standard item and reliability analyses were conducted. Construct validity was evaluated with exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in two subsamples (random split). Convergent validity was tested by predicting a high positive correlation of the EBPAS-36D with two scores of attitudes of the ISP and an interest in EBP score. It was tested whether the EBPAS-36D predicts the intention to use EBP. RESULTS: N = 599 psychotherapists participated in the study. The item analyses showed a mean item difficulty of p(i )= 0.64, a mean inter-item correlation of r = 0.18, and a mean item-total correlation of r(itc) = 0.40. The internal consistency was very good for the total scale (alpha = 0.89) and ranged from adequate to very good for the subscales (0.65-0.89), indicating high reliability. The original factor structure showed an acceptable model fit (RMSEA = 0.064 (90% CI = 0.059-0.068); SRMR = 0.0922; AIC = 1400.77), confirming the 12-factor structure of the EBPAS-36. However, a second-order factor structure derived by the EFA had an even better model fit (RMSEA = 0.057 (90% CI = 0.052-0.062); SRMR = 0.0822; AIC = 1274.56). When the EBPAS-36D was entered in a hierarchical regression model with the criterion Intention to use EBP, the EBPAS-36D contributed significantly to the prediction (Change in R(2) = 0.28, p < 0.001) over and above gender, age and participants' report of ever having worked in a university context.

Recently, the personality inventory for ICD-11 (PiCD) has emerged as one of the most widely used measures of these ICD-11 personality trait domains. METHODS: The current study contributed to the validation of the PiCD validation by exploring its stability and predictive links with psychological distress over 6 months in a sample of 206 German community adults. RESULTS: The PiCD trait domain scales displayed strong differential (all r >/= .80) and absolute stability (all |d| </= .09). Additionally, PiCD negative affectivity predicted depression, anxiety, and stress, and PiCD detachment predicted depression over 6 months beyond baseline. CONCLUSION: In sum, this study demonstrated the stability of the PiCD trait domain scores, supporting their utility for capturing relatively stable traits as described in the ICD-11.

Interpersonal theory of suicide: prospective examination,"Forkmann, T.; Glaesmer, H.; Paashaus, L.; Rath, D.; Schonfelder, A.; Stengler, K.; Juckel, G.; Assion, H. J.; Teismann, T.","BACKGROUND: The interpersonal theory of suicide (IPTS) is one of the most intensively researched contemporary theories on the development of suicidal ideation and behaviour. However, there is a lack of carefully conducted prospective studies. AIMS: To evaluate the main predictions of the IPTS regarding the importance of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness and capability for suicide in predicting future suicide attempts in a prospective design. METHOD: Psychiatric in-patients (n = 308; 53.6% (n = 165) female; mean age 36.82 years, s.d. = 14.30, range 18-81) admitted for severe suicidal ideation (n = 145, 47.1%) or a suicide attempt completed self-report measures of thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, capability for suicide, hopelessness, depression and suicidal ideation as well as interviews on suicide intent and suicide attempts and were followed up for 12 months. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were conducted. RESULTS: The interaction of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness and capability for suicide was not predictive of future suicide attempts, but perceived burdensomeness showed a significant main effect (z = 3.49, P < 0.01; OR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.59-3.58) and moderate performance in screening for future suicide attempts (area under the curve AUC = 0.729, P < 0.01).

What Dyadic Reparation Is Meant to Do: An Association with Infant Cortisol Reactivity,"Muller, M.; Zietlow, A. L.; Tronick, E.; Reck, C.","BACKGROUND: The latency to reparation of interactive mismatches (interactive repair) is argued to regulate infant distress on a psychobiological level, and maternal anxiety disorders might impair infant regulation. SAMPLING AND METHODS: A total of 46 dyads (19 mothers with an anxiety disorder, 27 controls) were analyzed for associations between interactive repair and infant cortisol reactivity during the Face-to-Face-Still-Face paradigm 3-4 months postpartum. Missing cortisol values (n = 16) were imputed. Analyses were conducted on both the original and the pooled imputed data. RESULTS: Interactive repair during the reunion episode was associated with infant cortisol reactivity (original data: p < 0.01; pooled data: p < 0.01) but not maternal anxiety disorder (p > 0.23). Additional stepwise regression analyses found that latency to repair during play (p < 0.01), an interaction between distress during the first trimester of pregnancy and latency to repair during reunion (p < 0.01) and infant self-comforting behaviors during the reunion episode (p = 0.04) made independent contributions to cortisol reactivity in the final regression model. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that interactive repair is related to infant psychobiological stress reactivity. The lack of a relation to maternal anxiety disorder may be due to the small sample size.

One-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial of sertraline and cognitive behavior group therapy in depressed primary care patients (MIND study),"Mergl, R.; Allgaier, A. K.; Hautzinger, M.; Coyne, J. C.; Hegerl, U.; Henkel, V.","BACKGROUND: The long-term course of symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderate depression is not well understood. A 12-month-follow-up analysis was performed on those participants from a randomized controlled 10-week trial (RCT, MIND-study), who had received either treatment with an antidepressant (sertraline) or a psychotherapeutic intervention (group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)). METHODS: The longitudinal interval follow-up evaluation (LIFE) was applied to 77 patients with mild-to moderate depression. The primary outcome was the number of weeks in the one-year follow-up period spent completely recovered from all depressive symptoms. Functional outcome was measured with the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. Further outcomes were relapse and remission rates based on weekly psychiatric rating scales (PSR) and the number of weeks in the follow-up period during which patients had a depressive disorder or subthreshold symptoms of depression. RESULTS: Patients with acute treatment (10 weeks) with SSRI and those with acute treatment with CBT (also 10 weeks) did not differ significantly concerning the number of weeks in the follow-up period in which they were completely recovered (primary outcome) (SSRI: 31.6 weeks (standard deviation (SD): 23.7), CBT: 27.8 weeks (SD: 24.3)). Sertraline was superior to CBT regarding GAF scores by trend (p = 0.06). LIMITATIONS: The generalizability of the findings is limited by the moderate sample size and missing values (LIFE).

Myofascial Tissue and Depression,"Michalak, J.; Aranmolate, L.; Bonn, A.; Grandin, K.; Schleip, R.; Schmiedtke, J.; Quassowsky, S.; Teismann, T.","BACKGROUND: The myofascial system plays a fundamental role in the mechanics of the body, in body tension regulation and the etiology of pathological states like chronic pain. Moreover, it contains contractile elements and preliminary evidence suggests that its properties are linked to psychological factors. The aim of the present research was to investigate characteristics of the myofascial tissue in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and to examine whether the state of the myofascial tissue causally affects pathopsychological processes in MDD. METHODS: In Study 1, stiffness and elasticity of the myofascial tissue of 40 inpatients suffering from MDD measured with a tissue compliance meter were compared with those of 40 matched never-depressed participants. In Study 2, 69 MDD patients were randomly assigned to single-session self-myofascial release intervention (SMRI) or a placebo intervention. Effects on memory bias and affect were investigated. RESULTS: Results showed that MDD patients displayed heightened stiffness and reduced elasticity of the myofascial tissue and that patients in the SMRI group showed a reduced negative memory bias and more positive affect compared to patients in the placebo condition. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results of our studies indicate that the myofascial tissue might be part of a dysfunctional body-mind dynamic that maintains MDD.

Efficacy of temporally intensified exposure for anxiety disorders: A multicenter randomized clinical trial,"Pittig, A.; Heinig, I.; Goerigk, S.; Thiel, F.; Hummel, K.; Scholl, L.; Deckert, J.; Pauli, P.; Domschke, K.; Lueken, U.; Fydrich, T.; Fehm, L.; Plag, J.; Strohle, A.; Kircher, T.; Straube, B.; Rief, W.; Koelkebeck, K.; Arolt, V.; Dannlowski, U.; Margraf, J.; Totzeck, C.; Schneider, S.; Neudeck, P.; Craske, M. G.; Hollandt, M.; Richter, J.; Hamm, A.; Wittchen, H. U.","BACKGROUND: The need to optimize exposure treatments for anxiety disorders may be addressed by temporally intensified exposure sessions. Effects on symptom reduction and public health benefits should be examined across different anxiety disorders with comorbid conditions. METHODS: This multicenter randomized controlled trial compared two variants of prediction error-based exposure therapy (PeEx) in various anxiety disorders (both 12 sessions + 2 booster sessions, 100 min/session): temporally intensified exposure (PeEx-I) with exposure sessions condensed to 2 weeks (n = 358) and standard nonintensified exposure (PeEx-S) with weekly exposure sessions (n = 368). Primary outcomes were anxiety symptoms (pre, post, and 6-months follow-up). Secondary outcomes were global severity (across sessions), quality of life, disability days, and comorbid depression. RESULTS: Both treatments resulted in substantial improvements at post (PeEx-I: d(within) = 1.50, PeEx-S: d(within) = 1.78) and follow-up (PeEx-I: d(within) = 2.34; PeEx-S: d(within) = 2.03). Both groups showed formally equivalent symptom reduction at post and follow-up. However, time until response during treatment was 32% shorter in PeEx-I (median = 68 days) than PeEx-S (108 days; TR(PeEx-I) = 0.68). Interestingly, drop-out rates were lower during intensified exposure. PeEx-I was also superior in reducing disability days and improving quality of life at follow-up without increasing relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment variants focusing on the transdiagnostic exposure-based violation of threat beliefs were effective in reducing symptom severity and disability in severe anxiety disorders. Temporally intensified exposure resulted in faster treatment response with substantial public health benefits and lower drop-out during the exposure phase, without higher relapse. Clinicians can expect better or at least comparable outcomes when delivering exposure in a temporally intensified manner.",2021,Nov,Depress Anxiety,38,11,1169-1181,34293223.0,10.1002/da.23204,,#654,Pittig 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Intranasal oxytocin increases covert attention to positive social cues,"Domes, G.; Sibold, M.; Schulze, L.; Lischke, A.; Herpertz, S. C.; Heinrichs, M.","BACKGROUND: The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has positive effects on the processing of emotional stimuli such as facial expressions. To date, research has focused primarily on conditions of overt visual attention. METHOD: We investigated whether a single intranasal dose of OT (24 IU) would modulate the allocation of attentional resources towards positive and negative facial expressions using a dot-probe paradigm in a sample of 69 healthy men. Attentional capacity for these facial cues was limited by presentation time (100 or 500 ms). In addition, we controlled for overt visual attention by recording eye movements using a remote eye tracker. RESULTS: Reaction times (RTs) in the dot-probe paradigm revealed a pronounced shift of attention towards happy facial expressions presented for 100 ms after OT administration, whereas there were no OT-induced effects for longer presentation times (500 ms). The results could not be attributed to modulations of overt visual attention as no substance effects on gazes towards the facial target were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that OT increased covert attention to happy faces, thereby supporting the hypothesis that OT modulates early attentional processes that might promote prosocial behavior.",2013,Aug,Psychol Med,43,8,1747-53,23146328.0,10.1017/S0033291712002565,,#655,Domes 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The German version of the Perceived Stress Scale - psychometric characteristics in a representative German community sample,"Klein, E. M.; Brahler, E.; Dreier, M.; Reinecke, L.; Muller, K. W.; Schmutzer, G.; Wolfling, K.; Beutel, M. E.","BACKGROUND: The Perceived Stress Scale Cohen (J Health Soc Behav 24:385-96, 1983) is a widely and well-established self-report scale measuring perceived stress. However, the German version of the PSS-10 has not yet been validated. Thus, the purposes of this representative study were to psychometrically evaluate the PSS-10, and to provide norm values for the German population. METHODS: The PSS-10 and standardized scales of depression, anxiety, fatigue, procrastination and life satisfaction were administered to a representative, randomly selected German community sample consisting of 1315 females and 1148 male participants in the age range from 14 to 90 years. RESULTS: The results demonstrated a good internal consistency and construct validity. Perceived stress was consistently associated with depression, anxiety, fatigue, procrastination and reduced life satisfaction. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a bi-dimensional structure with two related latent factors. Regarding demographic variables, women reported a higher level of stress than men. Perceived stress decreased with higher education, income and employment status. Older and married participants felt less stressed than younger and unmarried participants. CONCLUSION: The PSS-10 is a reliable, valid and economic instrument for assessing perceived stress. As psychological stress is associated with an increased risk of diseases, identifying subpopulations with higher levels of stress is essential. Due to the dependency of the perceived stress level on demographic variables, particularly age and sex, differentiated norm values are needed, which are provided in this paper.",2016,May 23,BMC Psychiatry,16,1,159,27216151.0,10.1186/s12888-016-0875-9,,#656,Klein 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Two-year stability and change of neuroticism and extraversion in treated and untreated persons with depression: findings from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA),"Renner, F.; Penninx, B. W.; Peeters, F.; Cuijpers, P.; Huibers, M. J.",BACKGROUND: The personality dimensions neuroticism and extraversion likely represent part of the vulnerability to depression. The stability over longer time periods of these personality dimensions in depressed patients treated with psychological treatment or medication and in untreated persons with depression in the general population remains unclear. Stability of neuroticism and extraversion in treated and untreated depressed persons would suggest that part of the vulnerability to depression remains stable over time. The current study addressed the question whether treatment in depressed patients is related to changes in neuroticism and extraversion. METHODS: Data are from 709 patients with major depressive disorder participating in a cohort study (Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety; NESDA). We determined the 2-year stability of extraversion and neuroticism in treated and untreated persons and related change in depression severity to change in personality over time. RESULTS: Neuroticism decreased from baseline to 2-year follow-up (d=0.73) in both treated and untreated persons. Extraversion did not change significantly after controlling for neuroticism and depression severity at baseline and follow-up. Decreased depressive symptoms over time were related to decreased neuroticism (d=1.91) whereas increased depressive symptoms over time were unrelated to neuroticism (d=0.06). LIMITATIONS: Patients were not randomized to treatment conditions and the groups are therefore not directly comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Treated patients with depression in the general population improve just as much on depression severity and neuroticism as untreated persons with depression. This suggests that changes in neuroticism in the context of treatment likely represent mood-state effects rather than direct effects of treatment.,2013,Sep 5,J Affect Disord,150,2,201-8,23608120.0,10.1016/j.jad.2013.03.022,,#657,Renner 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The German version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5): psychometric properties and diagnostic utility,"Kruger-Gottschalk, A.; Knaevelsrud, C.; Rau, H.; Dyer, A.; Schafer, I.; Schellong, J.; Ehring, T.","BACKGROUND: The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL, now PCL-5) has recently been revised to reflect the new diagnostic criteria of the disorder. METHODS: A clinical sample of trauma-exposed individuals (N = 352) was assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the PCL-5. Internal consistencies and test-retest reliability were computed. To investigate diagnostic accuracy, we calculated receiver operating curves. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were performed to analyze the structural validity. RESULTS: Results showed high internal consistency (alpha = .95), high test-retest reliability (r = .91) and a high correlation with the total severity score of the CAPS-5, r = .77. In addition, the recommended cutoff of 33 on the PCL-5 showed high diagnostic accuracy when compared to the diagnosis established by the CAPS-5. CFAs comparing the DSM-5 model with alternative models (the three-factor solution, the dysphoria, anhedonia, externalizing behavior and hybrid model) to account for the structural validity of the PCL-5 remained inconclusive.

The validity of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) as screening instrument with Kurdish and Arab displaced populations living in the Kurdistan region of Iraq,"Ibrahim, H.; Ertl, V.; Catani, C.; Ismail, A. A.; Neuner, F.","BACKGROUND: The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) is a valid and reliable self-report measure for the assessment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Recently the PCL was updated according to the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. So far only a few studies have examined the psychometric properties of the PCL-5, and all of these are restricted to populations living in industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to determine the psychometric properties and diagnostic utility of the PCL-5 as a screening instrument for war-affected displaced Kurdish and Arab populations. The specific goal was to determine a contextually valid cut-off score for a probable diagnosis of PTSD. METHODS: The PCL-5 was translated into Arabic and two Kurdish dialects. Trained interviewers administered these translations as assisted self-reports to 206 adults living in camps for displaced people in Iraq, together with depression and war-exposure instruments. Two weeks later, 98 randomly chosen subjects were reassessed by expert clinical psychologists. In the absence of a gold-standard instrument with proven validity in this context, the expert interviewers applied the PCL-5 items in the form of a clinical interview and used a DSM-5-algorithm to determine a diagnosis of PTSD. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) were performed to determine a valid cutoff-score. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the PCL-5 was high (alpha = .85) and the instrument showed an adequate convergent validity. Using the cut-off score of 23, the PCL-5 achieved the optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve = .82, p < .001; sensitivity = .82, specificity = .70). CONCLUSIONS: Given that the comparison of the two assessments included both a re-test interval and validation by different interviewers, our results indicate that the PCL-5 can be recommended as an assessment and screening instrument for Kurdish and Arab populations.",2018,Aug 16,BMC Psychiatry,18,1,259,30115040.0,10.1186/s12888-018-1839-z,,#659,Ibrahim 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Resting vagal tone is negatively associated with suicide ideation,"Forkmann, T.; Meessen, J.; Teismann, T.; Sutterlin, S.; Gauggel, S.; Mainz, V.","BACKGROUND: The present study aimed at investigating whether resting vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) as a trait-like biomarker of cognitive inhibitory control capacity is related to suicide ideation in a sample without suicide attempt history. METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy students participated voluntarily (18 to 34 years, M=24.5, SD=4.1; 73.0% female). Time and frequency measures of HRV were derived from an electrocardiogram that was recorded using Einthoven's Triangle lead II. Participants filled in the Rasch-based Depression Screening and four questions concerning lifetime suicide ideation (SI). Bivariate Pearson's and partial (controlling for depression severity) correlation coefficients were calculated between SI and measures of vagally mediated HRV. RESULTS: A significant correlation between the ln10-transformed high-frequency band of resting vagally mediated HRV and SI was found (r=-.33, p<.05). Correlations did not change substantially when controlling for depression. Mean heart rate as a time domain measure also significantly correlated with SI while controlling for depression (r=.36, p<.05). A trend correlation between SI and Root Mean Square of Successive Differences between interbeat intervals emerged. LIMITATIONS: SI was assessed with a composite score of four items measuring SI. Future studies should consider using more comprehensive assessment instruments. CONCLUSIONS: The relation between resting vagally mediated HRV and suicide ideation may be interpreted as indicating that reduced inhibitory cognitive control capacity may be a risk factor for suicidality. It may act already early in the suicidal process, before suicidal behavior develops and should be further investigated as potentially clinically important physiological predictor of suicidality.",2016,Apr,J Affect Disord,194,,30-2,26802504.0,10.1016/j.jad.2016.01.032,,#660,Forkmann 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Comparing mental health of Facebook users and Facebook non-users in an inpatient sample in Germany,"Brailovskaia, J.; Margraf, J.; Schillack, H.; Kollner, V.","BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate differences in variables of positive mental health (PMH, i.e., emotional, psychological and social well-being) and negative mental health (NMH, i.e., somatoform complaints, depressiveness, social stress and insomnia) between clinical inpatients who use the social platform Facebook and those who do not use Facebook. Furthermore, the link between duration of daily Facebook use and mental health should be considered. METHODS: In two subsamples of inpatients of a psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic in Germany (Facebook users: N = 336, Facebook non-users: N = 265), use of Facebook, PMH and NMH were assessed via a computer survey. RESULTS: Facebook users had significantly higher values of three variables of NMH (i.e., depressiveness, social stress and insomnia), and significantly lower values of PMH than Facebook non-users. Duration of daily Facebook use was significantly negatively associated with PMH and significantly positively with all variables of NMH. LIMITATIONS: Given the cross-sectional study design, current data do not imply causality. CONCLUSION: Current results indicate that Facebook use is negatively associated with PMH and positively with NMH in clinical inpatients. Thus, future research should investigate whether and how Facebook use may have a negative effect on the recovery process of the inpatients.",2019,Dec 1,J Affect Disord,259,,376-381,31470181.0,10.1016/j.jad.2019.08.078,,#661,Brailovskaia 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Short defeat and entrapment scale: A psychometric investigation in three German samples,"Holler, I.; Teismann, T.; Cwik, J.

METHODS: Validity and reliability were established in an online (N = 480), an outpatient (N = 277) and an inpatient sample (N = 296). Statistical analyses included confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and group differences in defeat and entrapment. RESULTS: For the online and the inpatient sample, the CFA indicated a two-factor solution, whereas for the outpatient sample both one- and two-factor solutions fitted the data equally well. Scale properties for the two-factor solution (defeat and entrapment subscale) were excellent. Thus, further analyses were based on this solution. For the online and the outpatient sample, suicidal ideators and suicide attempters scored significantly higher in defeat and entrapment than non-ideators and non-attempters. LIMITATIONS: Limiting factors of the study were the different measures across the samples and the cross-sectional design of the study. CONCLUSION: Though results were partly mixed, we found support for a two-factor solution of the instrument showing excellent psychometric properties in all three samples. The two-factor solution is further expected to have higher clinical utility than a one-factor solution. Suicidal ideators and suicide attempters in the online and outpatient sample showed higher scores in defeat and entrapment than non-ideators and non-attempters, emphasizing these two concepts as predictors for suicidal ideation.

"The role of pre-pandemic depression for changes in depression, anxiety, and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a longitudinal probability sample of adults from Germany","Benke, C.; Asselmann, E.; Entringer, T. M.; Pane-Farre, C. A.","BACKGROUND: The present study aims to delineate the role of preexisting depression for changes in common mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using mixed-effects linear regression models, we analyzed data on the course of depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-2) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2) symptoms as well as loneliness (three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale) in a subset of the Socio-Economic Panel Study, a large and nationally representative household panel study from Germany. Participants were assessed during the first COVID-19 wave in Germany (March 31 to July 4, 2020; n = 6,694) and prospectively followed up at the peak of the second COVID-19 wave (January 18 to February 15, 2021; n = 6,038). RESULTS: Overall, anxiety and depressive symptoms decreased, whereas loneliness increased from the first to the second COVID-19 wave. However, depressive symptoms increased and the surge in loneliness was steeper in those with versus without clinically relevant depressive symptoms in 2019 or a history of a depressive disorder before the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety symptoms remained stable throughout the pandemic in individuals with versus without clinically relevant depressive symptoms in 2019. Pre-pandemic depression was associated with overall higher depressive and anxiety symptoms and loneliness across both assessments. The stringency of lockdown measures did not affect the results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that individuals with a history of depressive symptoms before the COVID-19 pandemic are at increased risk to experience an escalation of mental health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Temporal and specific pathways of change in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for depression,"Bruijniks, S. J. E.; Meeter, M.; Lemmens, Lhjm; Peeters, F.; Cuijpers, P.; Huibers, M. J. H.","BACKGROUND: The present study investigated the specific and temporal role of putative mechanisms of change in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: 200 patients were randomized to CBT weekly, CBT twice weekly, IPT weekly or IPT twice weekly. Outcome and putative mechanisms of change (i.e., dysfunctional thinking, behavioral activation, CBT skills, IPT skills, therapeutic alliance, compliance, motivation) were measured multiple times up to six months after the start of treatment. Latent change score models were used to investigate temporal relations and test mediation. Explorative analyses tested whether baseline working memory moderated the effect of mechanism change on outcome change. RESULTS: CBT skills and dysfunctional thinking mediated the relation between treatment modality and changes in depression. In both treatments, IPT skills and behavioral activation were related to subsequent change in depression while a decrease in depression led to subsequent improvement in therapeutic alliance and a decrease in autonomous motivation. Change in compliance was unrelated to change in depression. Baseline working memory was related to therapy skill improvement. CONCLUSION: CBT skill improvement seems a specific mechanism of change leading to subsequent decrease in depression in CBT. Changes in IPT skills acted as a non-specific mechanism, subsequently reducing depression regardless of treatment modality. The specific role of cognitive change and behavioral activation remains unclear. Future studies should investigate the specificity and direction of the potential mechanisms of change throughout the course of therapy and investigate whether these mechanistic pathways differ between individuals.",2022,Apr,Behav Res Ther,151,,104010,35228163.0,10.1016/j.brat.2021.104010,,#664,Bruijniks 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Evaluation of an internet-based intervention for service members of the German armed forces with deployment-related posttraumatic stress symptoms,"Niemeyer, H.; Knaevelsrud, C.; Schumacher, S.; Engel, S.; Kuester, A.; Burchert, S.; Muschalla, B.; Weiss, D.; Spies, J.; Rau, H.; Willmund, G. D.","BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a therapist-guided internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) intervention for service members of the German Armed Forces with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The iCBT was adapted from Interapy, a trauma-focused evidence-based treatment based on prolonged exposure and cognitive restructuring. It lasted for 5 weeks and included 10 writing assignments (twice a week). The program included a reminder function if assignments were overdue, but no multimedia elements. Therapeutic written feedback was provided asynchronously within one working day. METHODS: Male active and former military service members were recruited from the German Armed Forces. Diagnoses were assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Psychopathology was assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Severity of PTSD was the primary outcome and anxiety was the secondary outcome. Participants were randomly allocated to a treatment group that received iCBT immediately or to a waitlist group that received iCBT after 6 weeks. Due to the overall small sample size (n = 37), the two groups were collapsed for the statistical analyses. Change during the intervention period was investigated using latent-change score models. RESULTS: Improvements in the CAPS-5 were small and not statistically significant. For anxiety, small significant improvements were observed from pre- to follow-up assessment. The dropout rate was 32.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The low treatment utilization and the high dropout rate are in line with previous findings on treatment of service members. The interpretation of the current null results for the efficacy of iCBT is limited due to the small sample size, however for military samples effect estimates were also smaller in other recent studies.

Daily stress reactivity: The unique roles of personality and social support,"Kaurin, A.; Wright, A. G. C.; Kamarck, T. W.","BACKGROUND: The processes through which social support exerts its influence in daily life are not well understood. Arguably, its salutary effects as an environmental variable might be construed as shared effects of personality. METHOD: To test this possibility, we investigated the unique and shared effects of personality and social support on daily stressor exposure (social conflict, task strain) and on the within-person association of stressor exposure with perceived stress. A community-sample of N = 391 adults completed an ambulatory assessment protocol for two 2-day periods with fixed hourly intervals spread across 16 hr. RESULTS: Consistent with our preregistered hypotheses, multilevel structural equation models returned that both, personality and perceived social support, predicted daily stressor exposure and moderated within-person effects of daily stressors on perceived stress. In contrast to our hypotheses, received social support had no effect on daily stress processes. When Extraversion, Neuroticism, and social support were added as joint predictors, Neuroticism and Extraversion were related to stressor exposure, and further moderated the within-person link between stressor exposure and stress experience, while perceived social support had an incremental beneficial effect on social conflict exposure and stress appraisal. CONCLUSION: Social support does not increment the well-established relationships between Neuroticism or Extraversion and stress reactivity.",2021,Oct,J Pers,89,5,1012-1025,33745127.0,10.1111/jopy.12633,,#666,Kaurin 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Gender disparities in pediatric research: a descriptive bibliometric study on scientific authorships,"Bohme, K.; Klingelhofer, D.; Groneberg, D. A.; Bendels, M. H. K.","BACKGROUND: The proportion of women in medicine, especially in pediatrics, is noticeably increasing. Yet, leadership positions are predominantly occupied by men. METHODS: Academic authorships of 156,642 pediatric original research articles were analyzed with regard to gender disparities. The evaluation included the proportion of female authorships (FAP), distributions over first-, co- and last-authorships, gender-related citation rates, a productivity analysis and investigations on journals, countries and pediatric sub-disciplines. RESULTS: In all, 46.6% of all authorships in pediatric research were held by female authors. Women held relatively more first-authorships (FAP = 52%) and had higher odds for first- (OR = 1.3) and co- (OR = 1.11) authorships, compared to men. The Prestige Index of -0.13 indicated an underrepresentation of female authors at prestigious first- and last-authorships. Citation rates were not affected by the gender of the key authors. At the country-level pronounced gender-related differences were detected. The time trend showed increasing female prospects forecasting a female-dominated Prestige Index of 0.05 in 2023. CONCLUSION: The integration of women in pediatric research has advanced. Opportunities for female authors differ at the country-level, but overall women are lacking in leadership positions. Improving career opportunities for women in pediatric research can be expected in the coming years. IMPACT: There is a measurable progress in the integration of female scientists.

Testing the ICD-11 proposal for complex PTSD in trauma-exposed adults: factor structure and symptom profiles,"Bottche, M.; Ehring, T.; Kruger-Gottschalk, A.; Rau, H.; Schafer, I.; Schellong, J.; Dyer, A.; Knaevelsrud, C.","Background: The proposed ICD-11 criteria for trauma-related disorders define posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex posttraumatic stress disorder (cPTSD) as separate disorders. Results of previous studies support the validity of this concept. However, due to limitations of existing studies (e.g. homogeneity of the samples), the present study aimed to test the construct validity and factor structure of cPTSD and its distinction from PTSD using a heterogeneous trauma-exposed sample. Method: Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to explore the factor structure of the proposed ICD-11 cPTSD diagnosis in a sample of 341 trauma-exposed adults (n = 191 female, M = 37.42 years, SD = 12.04). In a next step, latent profile analyses (LPAs) were employed to evaluate predominant symptom profiles of cPTSD symptoms. Results: The results of the CFA showed that a six-factor structure (i.e. symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal and symptoms of affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal problems) fits the data best. According to LPA, a four-class solution optimally characterizes the data. Class 1 represents moderate PTSD and low symptoms in the specific cPTSD clusters (PTSD group, 30.4%). Class 2 showed low symptom severity in all six clusters (low symptoms group, 24.1%). Classes 3 and 4 both exhibited cPTSD symptoms but differed with respect to the symptom severity (Class 3: cPTSD, 34.9% and Class 4: severe cPTSD, 10.6%). Conclusions: The findings replicate previous studies supporting the proposed factor structure of cPTSD in ICD-11.

[Courses of affects in an internet-based writing therapy for elderly war trauma survivors. A content analytic approach],"Bottche, M.; Berth, H.; Knaevelsrud, C.; Kuwert, P.","BACKGROUND: The proven efficacy of the therapeutic approach of writing therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) allows a broadening focus and an examination of therapeutic components as well as the written realisation of these on the word level. Prior content analyses showed that these primary data analyses provided valuable new findings allowing insights into the therapeutic process in addition to questionnaires. METHODS: Therapeutic texts from 51 patients were analysed using content analysis (Affective Dictionary Ulm). The aim of this work is to show differences in therapeutic components on a textual basis. RESULTS: There were differences in the frequency of use of emotions in the therapeutic components. In texts of trauma exposure, a significant increase of use of stressful word categories (fear, depression, and anxiousness) has been identified compared to biographical reconstruction texts. In texts of cognitive restructuring, the highest affective density is found in comparison to biographic reconstruction but also compared to trauma exposure, based on negative (depression, anxiousness, and fear) and positive (love, satisfaction, pleasure) affects equally.

The relevance of goal-orientation for motivation in high versus low proneness to negative symptoms,"Schlier, B.; Engel, M.; Fladung, A. K.; Fritzsche, A.; Lincoln, T. M.","BACKGROUND: The psychological mechanisms of why individuals with negative symptoms fail to initiate and perform goal-directed behavior are not well understood. Drawing on the reward-sensitivity and expectancy-value theories, we investigate whether negative symptom-like experiences (NSLE) are associated with generating less approach goals (aimed at reaching a positive outcome) and more avoidance goals (aimed at avoiding a negative outcome) and whether this type of goal-orientation explains motivational deficits (i.e., perceiving goals as less feasible and important and being less committed to them). METHODS: Based on the continuum model of negative symptoms, we identified two parallelized extreme groups with high and low levels of NSLE (n = 37, respectively) in an ad-hoc online-sample of healthy individuals (N = 262) using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences. In an online study, these participants were instructed to generate approach and avoidance goals and to rate each goal in terms of feasibility, importance and goal-commitment. RESULTS: Participants with low levels of NSLE generated more approach than avoidance goals. Participants with high levels of NSLE showed no such difference due to increased numbers of avoidance goals. Furthermore, avoidance goal-orientation predicted reduced subjective feasibility and importance of goals and less goal-commitment. LIMITATIONS: Results are based on a healthy sample rather than people with psychosis. No longitudinal or behavioral data for goal-striving was collected. CONCLUSION: People with NSLE generate more avoidance goals than controls. This is dysfunctional because it correlates with feeling less committed to reach one's goals. Optimizing goal-setting could be a promising starting-point for psychological interventions aimed at reducing negative symptoms.",2017,Jun,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,55,,113-120,28209215.0,10.1016/j.jbtep.2017.01.004,,#670,Schlier 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Demonstration of a 'leapfrog' randomized controlled trial as a method to accelerate the development and optimization of psychological interventions,"Blackwell, S. E.; Schonbrodt, F. D.; Woud, M. L.; Wannemuller, A.; Bektas, B.; Braun Rodrigues, M.; Hirdes, J.; Stumpp, M.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: The scale of the global mental health burden indicates the inadequacy not only of current treatment options, but also the pace of the standard treatment development process. The 'leapfrog' trial design is a newly-developed simple Bayesian adaptive trial design with potential to accelerate treatment development. A first leapfrog trial was conducted to provide a demonstration and test feasibility, applying the method to a low-intensity internet-delivered intervention targeting anhedonia. METHODS: At the start of this online, single-blind leapfrog trial, participants self-reporting depression were randomized to an initial control arm comprising four weeks of weekly questionnaires, or one of two versions of a four-week cognitive training intervention, imagery cognitive bias modification (imagery CBM). Intervention arms were compared to control on an ongoing basis via sequential Bayesian analyses, based on a primary outcome of anhedonia at post-intervention. Results were used to eliminate and replace arms, or to promote them to become the control condition based on pre-specified Bayes factor and sample size thresholds. Two further intervention arms (variants of imagery CBM) were added into the trial as it progressed. RESULTS: N = 188 participants were randomized across the five trial arms. The leapfrog methodology was successfully implemented to identify a 'winning' version of the imagery CBM, i.e. the version most successful in reducing anhedonia, following sequential elimination of the other arms. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates feasibility of the leapfrog design and provides a foundation for its adoption as a method to accelerate treatment development in mental health.

Psychometric Properties of a Self-Report Version of the Sexual Interest and Desire Inventory-Female (SIDI-F-SR),"Velten, J.; Hirschfeld, G.; Meyers, M.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: The Sexual Interest and Desire Inventory-Female (SIDI-F) is a clinician-administered scale that allows for a comprehensive assessment of symptoms related to Hypoactive Sexual Desire Dysfunction (HSDD). As self-report questionnaires may facilitate less socially desirable responding and as time and resources are scarce in many clinical and research settings, a self-report version was developed (Sexual Interest and Desire Inventory- Female Self-Report; SIDI-F-SR). AIM: To assess the psychometric properties of the SIDI-F-SR and to investigate the agreement between the SIDI-F and SIDI-F-SR. METHODS: A total of 170 women (Mage = 37, SD = 11, range = 20-69) with HSDD answered the SIDI-F, administered by a clinical psychologist via telephone, first, followed by the SIDI-F-SR, delivered as an Internet-based questionnaire. A subset of 19 women answered the SIDI-F-SR twice over a period of 14 weeks. OUTCOMES: Convergent validity of the SIDI-F-SR was assessed via correlations with the desire subscale of the Female Sexual Function Index and the Female Sexual Distress Scale Revised. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability as well as intraclass correlation and predictors of absolute agreement between SIDI-F and SIDI-F-SR were examined. RESULTS: Test-retest-reliability was good (r = 0.74). Convergent validity was low but comparable between SIDI-F and SIDI-F-SR. Internal consistency of the SIDI-F-SR was acceptable (alpha = 0.76) and comparable to the SIDI-F (alpha = 0.74). When corrections for the restriction of range were applied, internal consistency of the SIDI-F-SR increased to 0.91. There was high agreement between SIDI-F and SIDI-F-SR (ICC = 0.86). On average, women scored about one point higher (indicated more desire) in the self-report vs the clinician-administered scale. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The SIDI-F-SR can be used in settings where time and resources are limited. Whether the clinical cutoff point for the SIDI-F is adequate for the SIDI-F-SR has yet to be determined. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Large sample of diverse women with HSDD. Lack of control groups (ie, healthy controls, women with other sexual dysfunctions). CONCLUSION: The SIDI-F-SR showed promising psychometric properties in a sample of women with HSDD.

Screening for Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms in Young Refugees: Comparison of Questionnaire Data with and without Involvement of an Interpreter,"Muller, L. R. F.; Unterhitzenberger, J.; Wintersohl, S.; Rosner, R.; Konig, J.","Background: The substantial number of young refugees who have arrived in Europe since 2015 requires rapid screening to identify those in need of treatment. However, translated versions of screening measures are not always available, necessitating the support of interpreters. The Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS) is a validated questionnaire for posttraumatic stress symptoms. Here, we report on the psychometric properties of the CATS in a sample of young refugees as a function of interpreter involvement. Methods: A total of N = 145 (M(age) = 16.8, SD = 1.54; 93% male) were assessed with the CATS, with half of the screenings conducted with and half without interpreters. Post hoc analyses included calculating internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha. We used confirmative factor analysis to investigate the factor structure. Results: The CATS total scale showed good reliability (alpha = 0.84). Differences in psychometric properties between the interpreter vs. the no interpreter group were minor and tended to be in favor of the interpreter group. Results of a confirmatory factor analysis were acceptable after the exclusion of items with low item-scale correlations. Conclusions: The sample and the administration of the assessment represent the situation of young refugees in Germany, where resources are low and translated versions not always available. The CATS may be a helpful screening tool for clinicians working with young refugees, even when administered with an interpreter. Limitations include the post hoc design of the analysis without randomization of participants and the lack of a third comparison group using translated questionnaire versions.",2021,Jun 24,Int J Environ Res Public Health,18,13,6803,34202802.0,10.3390/ijerph18136803,,#675,Muller 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Differential effects of visually induced analgesia and attention depending on the pain stimulation site,"Cordier, L.; Ullrich, E. M.; Herpertz, S.; Zieglgansberger, W.; Trojan, J.; Diers, M.","BACKGROUND: The term 'visually induced analgesia' describes a reduced pain perception induced by watching the painful body part as opposed to watching a neutral object. In chronic back pain patients, experimental pain, movement-induced pain and habitual pain can be reduced with visual feedback. Visual feedback can also enhance the effects of both massage treatment and manual therapy. The impact of somatosensory attentional processes remains unclear. METHODS: In the current study, participants received painful electrical stimuli to their thumb and back while being presented with either a real-time video of their thumb or back (factor feedback). In addition, using an oddball paradigm, they had to count the number of deviant stimuli, applied to either their back or thumb (factor attention) and rate the pain intensity. RESULTS: We found a significant main effect for attention with decreased pain ratings during attention. There was no main effect for visual feedback and no significant interaction between visual feedback and attention. Post-hoc tests revealed that the lowest pain intensity ratings were achieved during visual feedback of the back/ thumb and counting at the back/ thumb. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the modulation of perceived acute pain by visually induced analgesia may be influenced by a simultaneous somatosensory attention task. SIGNIFICANCE: Somatosensory attention reduced experimental pain intensity in the thumb and back in the presence of both congruent and incongruent visual feedback. We found no significant visual feedback effect on the complex interplay between visual feedback and somatosensory attention.",2021,Feb,Eur J Pain,25,2,375-384,33063397.0,10.1002/ejp.1676,,#676,Cordier 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Gaze behavior is associated with the cortisol response to acute psychosocial stress in the virtual TSST,"Vatheuer, C. C.; Vehlen, A.; von Dawans, B.; Domes, G.","BACKGROUND: The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a reliable tool for psychobiological stress induction. Because of its socio-evaluative nature, it has been useful for investigating gaze behavior. It has been shown that healthy people avoid looking toward faces when under stress, a finding that corroborates studies demonstrating avoidance of eye contact in social anxiety disorder. Yet, little is known about the relationship between gaze behavior and the biological stress response. METHODS: In a final sample of 74 healthy males, a virtual reality version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-VR) with an integrated eye tracker was implemented to investigate gaze behavior during acute stress induction. Stress response measures were collected via saliva samples and subjective stress ratings. Additional questionnaires were administered for examining the influence of social anxiety traits. RESULTS: The TSST-VR elicited a significant psychobiological stress response. Overall, higher gaze times on judges compared to surroundings were found in the speech task while this pattern was reversed in the arithmetic task. Critically, there was a significant negative association between gaze time on judges and cortisol output in cortisol responders. CONCLUSIONS: In a non-clinical sample, avoidance of gaze is associated with a stronger cortisol response to acute stress. This study demonstrates the potential of eye tracking to disentangle the effects of acute stress on social interaction, warranting further investigation in clinical populations characterized by high levels of anxiety in social situations, such as social anxiety and autism spectrum disorder.",2021,Sep,J Neural Transm (Vienna),128,9,1269-1278,33914146.0,10.1007/s00702-021-02344-w,,#679,Vatheuer 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Daily dynamic assessment and modelling of intersession processes in ambulatory psychotherapy: A proof of concept study,"Kaiser, T.; Laireiter, A. R.","Background: the typical mode of assessment in studies on intersession processes (ISP) in psychotherapy is using cross-sectional or weekly measurements. Daily dynamics of intersession processes have not yet been studied. Method: intersession process data from 22 ambulatory psychotherapy cases were collected in a naturalistic study with high temporal resolution, resulting in a total of 1026 daily measurements. Multilevel vector autoregressive (VAR) modelling was applied to discover the temporal course and causal influences among intersession processes. Centrality analysis was applied to discover unique functions of various intersession process variables. Results: a group-level network structure was discovered, offering first insights on the role of different intersession processes during psychotherapy. Centrality analysis revealed unique roles for various aspects of the intersession process. Temporal distance from the last session had only weak influence on the ISP. Conclusions: using short, daily measures, the unique role of various aspects of the ISP were uncovered. Some aspects of the ISP, like recalling session contents or reflection on future session contents, are facilitators of overall ISP intensity. Other aspects like thoughts on payment or appointments or negative treatment-related emotions are likely to suppress ISP.",2019,Nov,Psychother Res,29,8,1062-1073,30012060.0,10.1080/10503307.2018.1497213,,#680,Kaiser 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Applicability of the ICD-11 proposal for PTSD: a comparison of prevalence and comorbidity rates with the DSM-IV PTSD classification in two post-conflict samples,"Stammel, N.; Abbing, E. M.; Heeke, C.; Knaevelsrud, C.","BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recently proposed significant changes to the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criteria in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the impact of these changes in two different post-conflict samples. METHOD: Prevalence and rates of concurrent depression and anxiety, socio-demographic characteristics, and indicators of clinical severity according to ICD-11 in 1,075 Cambodian and 453 Colombian civilians exposed to civil war and genocide were compared to those according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). RESULTS: Results indicated significantly lower prevalence rates under the ICD-11 proposal (8.1% Cambodian sample and 44.4% Colombian sample) compared to the DSM-IV (11.2% Cambodian sample and 55.0% Colombian sample). Participants meeting a PTSD diagnosis only under the ICD-11 proposal had significantly lower rates of concurrent depression and a lower concurrent total score (depression and anxiety) compared to participants meeting only DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. There were no significant differences in socio-demographic characteristics and indicators of clinical severity between these two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The lower prevalence of PTSD according to the ICD-11 proposal in our samples of persons exposed to a high number of traumatic events may counter criticism of previous PTSD classifications to overuse the PTSD diagnosis in populations exposed to extreme stressors. Also another goal, to better distinguish PTSD from comorbid disorders could be supported with our data.",2015,2015/05/18,Eur J Psychotraumatol,6,1,27070,25989951.0,10.3402/ejpt.v6.27070,,#681,Stammel 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Increasing the treatment motivation of patients with somatic symptom disorder: applying the URICA-S scale,"Mander, J.; Schaller, G.; Bents, H.; Dinger, U.; Zipfel, S.; Junne, F.","BACKGROUND: Therapeutic intervention programs for somatic symptom disorder (SSD) show only small-to-moderate effect sizes. These effects are partly explained by the motivational problems of SSD patients. Hence, fostering treatment motivation could increase treatment success. One central aspect in SSD patients might be damage to motivation because of symptomatic relapses. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to investigate associations between motivational relapse struggle and therapeutic outcome in SSD patients. METHODS: We assessed 84 inpatients diagnosed with SSD in the early, middle and late stages of their inpatient treatment. The maintenance subscale of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment-Short (URICA-S) was applied as a measure to assess motivational relapse struggle. Additionally, patients completed measures of treatment outcome that focus on clinical symptoms, stress levels and interpersonal functioning. RESULTS: The results from multiple regression analyses indicate that higher URICA-S maintenance scores assessed in early stages of inpatient treatment were related to more negative treatment outcomes in SSD patients. CONCLUSIONS: SSD patients with ambivalent treatment motivation may fail in their struggle against relapse over the course of therapy. The URICA-S maintenance score assessed at therapy admission facilitated early identification of SSD patients who are at greater risk of relapse. Future studies should incorporate randomized controlled trials to investigate whether this subgroup could benefit from motivational interventions that address relapse.",2017,Jul 3,BMC Psychiatry,17,1,240,28673262.0,10.1186/s12888-017-1400-5,,#682,Mander 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"Interplay of demographic variables, birth experience, and initial reactions in the prediction of symptoms of posttraumatic stress one year after giving birth","Konig, J.; Schmid, S.; Loser, E.; Neumann, O.; Buchholz, S.; Kastner, R.","BACKGROUND: There has been increasing research on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childbirth in the last two decades. The literature on predictors of who develops posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) suggests that both vulnerability and birth factors have an influence, but many studies measure predictors and outcomes simultaneously. OBJECTIVE: In this context, we aimed to examine indirect and direct effects of predictors of PSS, which were measured longitudinally. METHOD: We assessed women within the first days (n=353), 6 weeks, and 12 months (n=183) after having given birth to a healthy infant. The first assessment included questions on demographics, pregnancy, and birth experience. The second and third assessments contained screenings for postpartum depression, PTSD, and general mental health problems, as well as assessing social support and physical well-being. We analysed our data using structural equation modelling techniques (n=277). RESULTS: Our final model showed good fit and was consistent with a diathesis-stress model of PSS. Women who had used antidepressant medication in the 10 years before childbirth had higher PSS at 6 weeks, independent of birth experiences. Subjective birth experience was the early predictor with the highest total effect on later PSS. Interestingly, a probable migration background also had a small but significant effect on PSS via more episiotomies. The null results for social support may have been caused by a ceiling effect. CONCLUSIONS: Given that we measured predictors at different time points, our results lend important support to the etiological model, namely, that there is a vulnerability pathway and a stress pathway leading to PSS. PSS and other psychological measures stayed very stable between 6 weeks and 1 year postpartum, indicating that it is possible to identify women developing problems early. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ARTICLE: Our results are consistent with a diathesis-stress model: vulnerability (antidepressant use in the previous 10 years) influenced posttraumatic stress symptoms at 6 weeks and 1 year, independently of stress (birth-related variables). The strongest predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms 1 year postpartum was posttraumatic stress symptoms 6 weeks postpartum. This means that women who develop problems could be identified during routinely offered postpartum care. Women with a probable migration background experienced more PSS 1 year after the birth, which was an indirect effect through more episiotomies and more PSS after 6 weeks.",2016,2016/10/24,Eur J Psychotraumatol,7,1,32377,27782876.0,10.3402/ejpt.v7.32377,,#683,Konig 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Anti-Suicide Function of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury in Female Inpatient Adolescents,"Kraus, L.; Schmid, M.; In-Albon, T.","BACKGROUND: There have been numerous studies investigating the relationship between nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality. On the one side, NSSI is an important risk factor for suicidality, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors. On the other side, it has been suggested that one function of NSSI might be as a coping mechanism that can help individuals in the short term avoid suicide. The present study investigated the relationship between suicidality and NSSI in female inpatient adolescents, focusing on NSSI as an anti-suicide strategy. METHODS: Subjects were 56 female adolescents, aged 12-18 years (M = 15.95 years, SD = 1.27), recruited from different inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric units. All participants fulfilled the DSM-5 research criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury disorder (NSSI-D). To assess suicidality, NSSI-D, and current and past diagnoses, a structured clinical interview was conducted. RESULTS: NSSI as a short-term coping strategy for avoiding suicide was indicated by one third (32.1%) of the participants. Before participants engaged in NSSI, the anti-suicide function was reported more frequently than reducing interpersonal problems (d = -.59). Getting relief from negative emotions and inducing positive feelings were reported at the same frequency as avoiding suicide before NSSI. Participants engaging in NSSI to avoid suicide and those reporting other functions did not significantly differ regarding other NSSI characteristics, suicidality, or psychopathology. Results indicate that the anti-suicide function significantly predicts the duration of current suicidal ideation (beta = .557). CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary support for the idea that NSSI is frequently used by female adolescents with NSSI-D to avoid suicide. Given the high co-occurrence of NSSI and suicidality, our results underline the importance of clinical assessment of suicidality and several NSSI functions, including the anti-suicide function, in adolescents with NSSI.",2020,2020/06/03,Front Psychiatry,11,,490,32581870.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00490,,#684,Kraus 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Test-retest reliability of the computer-assisted DIA-X-5 interview for mental disorders,"Hoyer, J.; Voss, C.; Strehle, J.; Venz, J.; Pieper, L.; Wittchen, H.

Therefore, the computer-assisted DIA-X-5 was developed and its test-retest reliability was explored. The DIA-X-5 is based on the DIA-X/M-CIDI (Diagnostisches Expertensystem fur psychische Storungen/Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview) which referred to the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). METHODS: A convenience sample (N = 60, age: 15-67) was interviewed twice with the computer-assisted DIA-X-5 interview, on average nine days apart, by trained and blinded interviewers. The DIA-X-5 is a standardized instrument for research purposes covering symptoms, syndromes and diagnoses from eleven classes of mental disorders according to the DSM-5 with matching F codes of the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). RESULTS: Kappa values ranged from 0.90 for post-traumatic stress disorder to 0.30 for social anxiety disorder. For age of onset and age of recency, test-retest reliability as measured by intra-class correlation was satisfying with values above 0.90 for most disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Test-retest reliability of the DIA-X-5 syndromes and diagnoses were comparable to those of previous DSM-IV/DIA-X diagnoses for most disorders.

Progression of externalizing disorders into anxiety disorders: Longitudinal transitions in the first three decades of life,"Knappe, S.; Martini, J.; Muris, P.; Wittchen, H. U.; Beesdo-Baum, K.","BACKGROUND: There is a notable comorbidity between externalizing disorders and anxiety disorders, which may be explained by the co-occurrence of two prevalent early-onset disorders, by shared vulnerability and risk factors, or as evidence that one disorder group might be causally related to the other. AIM: To investigate the longitudinal trajectories of externalizing disorders, their interplay with anxiety disorders, and putative predictors for symptom progression in youth. METHODS: 1053 adolescents (14-17 years) from the general population were assessed at baseline and prospectively at 2, 4, and 10-year follow-up using a standardized interview of mental disorders (DIA-X/M-CIDI) to assess ""early"" (oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder, ADHD) and ""late"" (antisocial behavior, substance use disorders) externalizing disorders as well as anxiety disorders. Longitudinal associations and predictors for symptom progression were examined using Kaplan-Meier-analyses. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of early externalizing disorders were 9.1% and 6.4% among those with and without any anxiety disorder. A late externalizing disorder was reported by 50.3% of those with an early externalizing disorder and in 26.6% of those with any anxiety disorder. Both early (HR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.3) and late externalizing disorders (HR: 2.1, 95%CI: 1.7-2.6) were associated with incident anxiety disorders. Higher parental rejection, lower volitional inhibition, and higher volitional avoidance predicted incident anxiety disorders among those with early externalizing disorders.

Introduction and evaluation of a therapeutic adherence and competence scale for grief-focused cognitive behavioural therapy,"Haneveld, J.; Rosner, R.; Vogel, A.; Makitalo, S.; Treml, J.; Steil, R.; Rief, W.; Comtesse, H.","BACKGROUND: There is no therapeutic competence and adherence scale for grief-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (grief-focused CBT). However, given the growing body of evidence for the efficacy of grief-focused CBT, such a scale is needed both to ensure the internal validity of clinical trials and to facilitate psychotherapy process research. OBJECTIVE: To develop and undertake a psychometric evaluation of a therapeutic adherence and competence scale for grief-focused CBT. METHOD: The scale was developed in two steps. (I) Five experts on the treatment of prolonged grief disorder provided feedback on the relevance and appropriateness of the items. The scale was revised to reflect their feedback. The final therapeutic adherence and competence scale for grief (TACs-G) consisted of 15 adherence and 16 competence items. (II) Psychometric evaluation of the TACs-G was based on the rating of 48 randomly selected PG-CBT sessions by two independent raters. The videos were recorded in the context of a randomized controlled trial (RCT; DRKS00012317.) ICC was used to calculate inter-rater reliability and TACs-G stability over time (re-evaluation of 10 sessions after 12 months). RESULTS: The five experts confirmed the relevance and appropriateness of the items. Interrater reliability was found to be high for the total adherence and competence scores (ICC = 0.889 and 0.782, respectively) and moderate to excellent for individual items (ICC = 0.509-1.00). The TACs-G stability over time was found to be strong for both adherence (ICC = 0.970) and competence total scores (ICC = 0.965). CONCLUSIONS: The TACs-G for CBT is a reliable instrument that can be used not only to ensure internal validity but is also suited for psychotherapy process studies. Additionally, it provides a valuable database for targeted feedback in training settings. HIGHLIGHTS: This is the first study to report on the development and psychometrical evaluation of a grief-focused adherence and competence scale.Although an increasing number of clinical trials do report the efficacy of grief-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy, none of these studies used a standardized adherence and competence scale to control internal validity.In the present study, we introduced a therapeutic adherence and competence scale for grief (TACs-G) that can be applied efficiently across different research settings (e.g. manipulation check, dissemination), and report results of good to excellent psychometric properties.The scale itself could prove useful beyond the research setting as it could possibly serve as a basis for feedback in training settings.",2022,2022/06/15,Eur J Psychotraumatol,13,1,2079873,35759325.0,10.1080/20008198.2022.2079873,,#689,Haneveld 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
The efficacy of a family-based cognitive-behavioral treatment for separation anxiety disorder in children aged 8-13: a randomized comparison with a general anxiety program,"Schneider, S.; Blatter-Meunier, J.; Herren, C.; In-Albon, T.; Adornetto, C.; Meyer, A.; Lavallee, K. L.","BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled trial examines the relative efficacy of a disorder-specific treatment program (TrennungsAngstprogramm Fur Familien [TAFF]; English: Separation Anxiety Family Therapy) for children suffering from separation anxiety disorder (SAD) in comparison with a general anxiety program. METHOD: Sixty-four children aged 8-13 with SAD and their parents were assigned either to a 16-session disorder-specific SAD treatment program, including parent training and classical cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) components (TAFF), or to a general child-focused 16-week comparison group (Coping Cat [CC]) without any parent training. Diagnoses and parent cognitions were assessed at baseline and at follow-ups. Global success ratings were collected at end of treatment and at follow-up. Ratings for anxiety, impairment/distress, and life quality were collected at Baseline 1, again after a 4-week waiting period, repeatedly throughout treatment, at 4 weeks, and at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: The response rate (no SAD diagnosis) at 4-week follow-up among the 52 treatment completers was 87.5% vs. 82.1% (TAFF vs. CC; intent-to-treat: 67.7% vs. 69.7%). At 1-year follow-up, the response was 83.3% versus 75% (TAFF vs. CC; intent to treat: 64.5% vs. 63.6%). Differences were nonsignificant. Results from rating scales indicated improvement for both groups across time points and assessment areas, with few between-group differences, and some small effects favoring the TAFF program. Both treatment programs yielded a reduction in parental dysfunctional beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a slight advantage of the TAFF program over a general child-based treatment for SAD. However, these differences were less strong than hypothesized, indicating that the inclusion of parent training does not add large effects to classical child-based CBT in school-age children with SAD.

The Compulsive Exercise Test: confirmatory factor analysis and links with eating psychopathology among women with clinical eating disorders,"Meyer, C.; Plateau, C. R.; Taranis, L.; Brewin, N.; Wales, J.; Arcelus, J.","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the Compulsive Exercise Test (CET) among an adult sample of patients with eating disorders. METHOD: Three hundred and fifty six patients and 360 non-clinical control women completed the CET and the Eating Disorders Examination questionnaire (EDE-Q). RESULTS: A confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the clinical data showed a moderate fit to the previously published five factor model derived from a community sample (Taranis L, Touyz S, Meyer C, Eur Eat Disord Rev 19:256-268, 2011). The clinical group scored significantly higher than the non-clinical group on four of the five CET subscales, and logistic regression analysis revealed that the CET could successfully discriminate between the two groups. A Receiver Operating Curve analysis revealed that a cut-off score of 15 on the CET resulted in acceptable values of both sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The CET appears to have a factor structure that is acceptable for use with an adult sample of patients with eating disorders. It can identify compulsive exercise among patients with eating disorders and a cut-off score of 15 is acceptable as indicating an appropriate cut-off point.",2016,2016/08/19,J Eat Disord,4,1,22,27547403.0,10.1186/s40337-016-0113-3,,#691,Meyer 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Is it best to expect the worst? Influence of patients' side-effect expectations on endocrine treatment outcome in a 2-year prospective clinical cohort study,"Nestoriuc, Y.; von Blanckenburg, P.; Schuricht, F.; Barsky, A. J.; Hadji, P.; Albert, U. S.; Rief, W.","BACKGROUND: This study aims to determine the role of patient expectations as potentially modifiable factor of side-effects, quality of life, and adherence to endocrine treatment of breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 2-year prospective clinical cohort study was conducted in routine primary care with postoperative patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, scheduled to start adjuvant endocrine treatment. Structured patient-reported assessments of side-effects, side-effect expectations, quality of life, and adherence took place during the first week post-surgery and after 3 and 24 months of endocrine treatment. RESULTS: Of 111 enrolled patients, at 3 and 24 months, 107 and 88 patients, respectively, were assessed. After 2 years of endocrine treatment, patients reported high rates of side-effects (arthralgia: 71.3%, weight gain: 53.4%, hot flashes: 46.5%), including symptoms not directly attributable to the medication (breathing problems: 28.1%, dizziness: 25.6%). Pre-treatment expectations significantly predicted patient-reported long-term side-effects and quality of life in multivariate models controlling for relevant medical and psychological variables. Relative risk of side-effects after 2 years of endocrine treatment was higher in patients with high negative expectations at baseline than in those with low negative expectations (RR = 1.833, CI 95%, 1.032-3.256). A significant interaction confirmed this expectation effect to be particularly evident in patients with high side-effects at 3 months. Furthermore, baseline expectations were associated with adherence at 24 months (r = -0.25, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Expectations are a genuine factor of clinical outcome from endocrine treatment for breast cancer. Negative expectations increase the risk of treatment-specific side-effects, nocebo side-effects, and non-adherence. Yet, controlled studies are needed to analyze potential causal relationships. Optimizing individual expectations might be a promising strategy to improve side-effect burden, quality of life, and adherence during longer-term drug intake.

Impulsive decision-making predicts the course of substance-related and addictive disorders,"Kraplin, A.; Hofler, M.; Pooseh, S.; Wolff, M.; Kronke, K. M.; Goschke, T.; Buhringer, G.; Smolka, M. N.","BACKGROUND: This study investigated whether patterns of impulsive decision-making (i) differ between individuals with DSM-5 substance use disorders (SUD) or non-substance-related addictive disorders (ND) and healthy controls, and (ii) predict the increase of SUD and ND severity after one year. METHODS: In a prospective-longitudinal community study, 338 individuals (19-27 years, 59% female) were included in one of three groups: SUD (n = 100), ND (n = 118), or healthy controls (n = 120). Group differences in four impulsive decision-making facets were analyzed with the Bayesian priors: delay discounting (mean = 0.37, variance = 0.02), probability discounting for gains and for losses (each - 0.16, 0.02), and loss aversion (- 0.44, 0.02). SUD and ND severity were assessed at baseline and after 1 year (n = 312, 92%). Predictive associations between decision-making and SUD/ND severity changes were analyzed with the Bayesian prior: mean = 0.25, variance = 0.016. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the SUD group displayed steeper delay discounting and lower probability discounting for losses; the ND group displayed lower probability discounting for losses (posterior probabilities > 98%). SUD symptom increase after 1 year was predicted by steeper delay discounting and lower loss aversion; ND symptom increase by lower probability discounting for losses and lower loss aversion (posterior probabilities > 98%). There was low evidence for predictive relations between decision-making and the quantity-frequency of addictive behaviours. DISCUSSION: Impulsive decision-making characterizes SUD and ND and predicts the course of SUD and ND symptoms but not the engagement in addictive behaviours.

The impact of maternal anxiety disorder on mother-infant interaction in the postpartum period,"Reck, C.; Tietz, A.; Muller, M.; Seibold, K.; Tronick, E.","BACKGROUND: This study investigated whether postpartum anxiety disorder is associated to altered patterns of infant as well as maternal engagement in a Face-to-Face-Still-Face interaction (FFSF). SAMPLING AND METHODS: n = 39 women with postpartum DSM-IV anxiety disorder and n = 48 healthy mothers were videotaped during a FFSF with their infant (M = 4.1 months). RESULTS: Infants of the clinical group showed significantly less positive engagement during the play episode than infants of controls. This result depended on infant sex: male controls demonstrated more positive interaction than males of anxious mothers. There was no such effect for female infants who engaged significantly less positively during the play episode than males and did not change their positive engagement during the FFSF. These findings imply pronounced interactive positivity and early vulnerability to maternal anxiety symptoms in male infants. Only the infants of the controls showed the still-face effect. They also protested significantly more during the still-face, while the clinical infants' protest increased significantly during the reunion. Women of both groups did not differ in their interaction. Maternal intrusiveness was associated to infant protest in the course of the FFSF.

The Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ): development and evaluation of an instrument to assess diabetes self-care activities associated with glycaemic control,"Schmitt, A.; Gahr, A.; Hermanns, N.; Kulzer, B.; Huber, J.; Haak, T.","BACKGROUND: Though several questionnaires on self-care and regimen adherence have been introduced, the evaluations do not always report consistent and substantial correlations with measures of glycaemic control. Small ability to explain variance in HbA1c constitutes a significant limitation of an instrument's use for scientific purposes as well as clinical practice. In order to assess self-care activities which can predict glycaemic control, the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ) was designed. METHODS: A 16 item questionnaire to assess self-care activities associated with glycaemic control was developed, based on theoretical considerations and a process of empirical improvements. Four subscales, 'Glucose Management' (GM), 'Dietary Control' (DC), 'Physical Activity' (PA), and 'Health-Care Use' (HU), as well as a 'Sum Scale' (SS) as a global measure of self-care were derived. To evaluate its psychometric quality, 261 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes were assessed with the DSMQ and an established analogous scale, the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure (SDSCA). The DSMQ's item and scale characteristics as well as factorial and convergent validity were analysed, and its convergence with HbA1c was compared to the SDSCA. RESULTS: The items showed appropriate characteristics (mean item-total-correlation: 0.46 +/- 0.12; mean correlation with HbA1c: -0.23 +/- 0.09). Overall internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was good (0.84), consistencies of the subscales were acceptable (GM: 0.77; DC: 0.77; PA: 0.76; HU: 0.60). Principal component analysis indicated a four factor structure and confirmed the designed scale structure. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated appropriate fit of the four factor model. The DSMQ scales showed significant convergent correlations with their parallel SDSCA scales (GM: 0.57; DC: 0.52; PA: 0.58; HU: n/a; SS: 0.57) and HbA1c (GM: -0.39; DC: -0.30; PA: -0.15; HU: -0.22; SS: -0.40). All correlations with HbA1c were significantly stronger than those obtained with the SDSCA. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that the DSMQ is a reliable and valid instrument and enables an efficient assessment of self-care behaviours associated with glycaemic control. The questionnaire should be valuable for scientific analyses as well as clinical use in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients.",2013,Aug 13,Health Qual Life Outcomes,11,1,138,23937988.0,10.1186/1477-7525-11-138,,#696,Schmitt 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Lay causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural correlates in five countries,"Meyer, C.; Kampisiou, C.; Triliva, S.; Knaevelsrud, C.; Stammel, N.","BACKGROUND: To date, cultural clinical research has primarily focused on differences between ethnic groups when investigating causal beliefs about mental disorders. While individual as well as contextual factors are considered important for gaining a better understanding of cultural influences, research on causal beliefs about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cultural correlates in laypersons is scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at gain a better understanding of the association between causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural aspects, as well as other contextual and individual correlates of causal beliefs. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional, vignette-based online survey with 737 laypersons from Mexico, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, and Russia. Participants completed the illness perception questionnaire revised (IPQ-R) and reported several cultural and sociodemographic (e.g. country of residence, gender, personal values) as well as mental health-related variables (e.g. PTSD symptoms, previous seeking of help). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of individuals expressing similar causal beliefs for PTSD. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse covariates of class membership. RESULTS: LCA resulted in a three-class solution of casual beliefs: a traumatic event-focused class (41.1%); an intrapersonal causes class (40.1%); and a multiple causes class (18.0%). Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed country of residence, gender, personal value of security, PTSD symptoms, and mental health literacy as significant covariates of class membership. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating a more diverse concept of culture into cultural clinical research can be a valuable addition to group comparisons based on nationality or ethnicity. Cultural clinical research needs to move towards a more integrated approach that accounts for the complexity of culture. Including additional contextual and sociodemographic factors can help to reach a more accurate understanding of the cultural influences on the development of causal beliefs and mental health.",2022,2022/02/07,Eur J Psychotraumatol,13,1,2029333,35145609.0,10.1080/20008198.2022.2029333,,#699,Meyer 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Development and Psychometric Properties of the Test of Passive Aggression,"Schanz, C. G.; Equit, M.; Schafer, S. K.; Kafer, M.; Mattheus, H. K.; Michael, T.","Background: To date, most research on aggression in mental disorders focused on active-aggressive behavior and found self-directed and other-directed active aggression to be a symptom and risk-factor of psychopathology. On the other hand, passive-aggressive behavior has been investigated less frequently and only in research on psychodynamic defense mechanisms, personality disorders, and dysfunctional self-control processes. This small number of studies primarily reflects a lack of a reliable and valid clinical assessment of passive-aggressive behavior. To address this gap, we developed the Test of Passive Aggression (TPA), a 24-item self-rating scale for the assessment of self-directed and other-directed passive-aggressive behavior. Method: Study 1 examined the internal consistency and factorial validity of the TPA in an inpatient sample (N = 307). Study 2 investigated the retest-reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity (active aggression, personality traits, impulsivity) of the TPA in a student sample (N = 180). Results: In line with our hypothesis, Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling revealed an acceptable to good fit of a bi-factorial structure of the TPA (Chi-square-df-ratio = 1.98; RMSR = 0.05, fit.off = 0.96). Both TPA scales showed good to excellent internal consistency (alpha = 0.83-0.90) and 4-week retest-reliability (r (tt) = 0.86). Correlations with well-established aggression scales, measures of personality, and impulsivity support discriminant and convergent validity of the TPA. Conclusions: The TPA is a reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of self-directed and other-directed passive-aggressive behavior.",2021,2021/04/26,Front Psychol,12,,579183,33981263.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.579183,,#700,Schanz 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Development and calibration of an item bank for the assessment of activities of daily living in cardiovascular patients using Rasch analysis,"Baumeister, H.; Abberger, B.; Haschke, A.; Boecker, M.; Bengel, J.; Wirtz, M.","BACKGROUND: To develop and calibrate the activities of daily living item bank (ADLib-cardio) as a prerequisite for a Computer-adaptive test (CAT) for the assessment of ADL in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). METHODS: After pre-testing for relevance and comprehension a pool of 181 ADL items were answered on a five-point Likert scale by 720 CVD patients, who were recruited in fourteen German cardiac rehabilitation centers. To verify that the relationship between the items is due to one factor, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted. A Mokken analysis was computed to examine the double monotonicity (i.e. every item generates an equivalent order of person traits, and every person generates an equivalent order of item difficulties). Finally, a Rasch analysis based on the partial credit model was conducted to test for unidimensionality and to calibrate the item bank. RESULTS: Results of CFA and Mokken analysis confirmed a one factor structure and double monotonicity. In Rasch analysis, merging response categories and removing items with misfit, differential item functioning or local response dependency reduced the ADLib-cardio to 33 items. The ADLib-cardio fitted to the Rasch model with a nonsignificant item-trait interaction (chi-square = 105.42, df = 99; p = 0.31). Person-separation reliability was 0.81 and unidimensionality could be verified. CONCLUSIONS: The ADLib-cardio is the first calibrated, unidimensional item bank that allows for the assessment of ADL in rehabilitation patients with CVD. As such, it provides the basis for the development of a CAT for the assessment of ADL in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Calibrating the ADLib-cardio in other than rehabilitation cardiovascular patient settings would further increase its generalizability.",2013,Aug 2,Health Qual Life Outcomes,11,1,133,23914735.0,10.1186/1477-7525-11-133,,#701,Baumeister 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Exposure and cognitive-behavioural therapy for chronic back pain: An RCT on treatment processes,"Schemer, L.; Schroeder, A.; Ornbol, E.; Glombiewski, J. A.","BACKGROUND: To improve treatment outcomes, it is essential to understand the processes involved in therapeutic change. The aim of this study was to investigate the processes involved in treatment of individuals with chronic lower back pain (CLBP) and high fear-avoidance. Graded in vivo exposure (Exposure), a specific treatment, and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), a general treatment, were compared. METHODS: Our study used data from a three-arm randomized controlled trial. The sample comprised 61 CLBP patients (pain duration >3 months; sufficient level of fear-avoidance). Assessments of session-by-session processes were done weekly for a maximum 14 weeks. The primary outcome, functional disability, was assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 6-months follow-up. First, two-level models were used to test for treatment-related similarities and differences in the changes in session-by-session measures (i.e., common and unique treatment processes respectively). Second, we analysed treatment processes as predictors of treatment outcome. RESULTS: Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence of unique treatment processes. Our results indicate that Exposure and CBT share some treatment processes. Specifically, patients reported a reduction in fear of movement and improvements in their ability to relax, to distract themselves, to manage their pain, to confront feared movements, to be active and to enjoy things despite their pain. Changes in fear of movement, relaxation, distraction, confrontation, activity and pain-related self-efficacy were also related to disability reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Despite conceptual differences, Exposure and CBT may share common treatment processes. Future research needs to address, however, whether these processes need to be targeted directly or can be supported indirectly. SIGNIFICANCE: We identified several treatment processes (e.g., reduction of fear of movement, enhancement of self-efficacy), which were associated with disability reduction during the management of chronic pain and fear-avoidance. These processes appeared to be equally important for Exposure and CBT. Practitioners should optimize these processes to improve their patients' functioning.",2019,Mar,Eur J Pain,23,3,526-538,30318664.0,10.1002/ejp.1326,,#702,Schemer 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Placebo nasal spray protects female participants from experimentally induced sadness and concomitant changes in autonomic arousal,"Gohler, A. C.; Haas, J. W.; Sperl, M. F. J.; Hermann, C.; Winkler, A.","BACKGROUND: To investigate the powerful placebo effects in antidepressant drug trials and their mechanisms, recent pioneering experimental studies showed that expectation manipulation combined with an active placebo attenuated induced sadness. In the present study, we aimed at extending these findings by assessing the psychophysiological response in addition to mere self-report. METHODS: One hundred and thirteen healthy female students were randomly assigned to a drug expectation group (active placebo, positive treatment expectation), placebo expectation group (active placebo, no treatment expectation), or a no-treatment group (no placebo, no treatment expectation). After placebo intake, sadness was induced by self-deprecating statements using the Velten method combined with sad music, including a rumination phase. Sadness was measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Expanded Form (PANAS-X). Heart rate and skin conductance were assessed continuously. RESULTS: After mood induction and after rumination, self-reported sadness was significantly lower, and skin conductance level was significantly higher, in the drug expectation group than in the no-treatment group. The mood induction was further accompanied by a heart rate deceleration within all groups. LIMITATIONS: Generalizability is limited by sample selectivity and focusing on sadness as a symptom of depression, exclusively. CONCLUSION: Expectation-induced placebo effects significantly influenced sadness-correlated changes in autonomic arousal, and not only subjectively reported sadness, indicating that placebo effects in the context of affect are not merely due to subjective response bias. The systematic modification of treatment expectation could be utilized in clinical practice to optimize current therapeutic approaches to improve mood regulation.",2021,Dec 1,J Affect Disord,295,,131-138,34438321.0,10.1016/j.jad.2021.07.037,,#703,Gohler 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Fostering compliance with physical distancing by interactive feedback in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: A web-based randomized controlled trial,"Kaiser, T.; Mogling, I.; Feldmann, M.; Hamm, A.; Brakemeier, E. L.","BACKGROUND: To slow down the spread of COVID-19, the observance of basic hygiene measures, and physical distancing is recommended. Initial findings suggest that physical distancing in particular can prevent the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To investigate how information to prevent the spread of infectious diseases should be presented to increase willingness to comply with preventive measures. METHODS: In a preregistered online experiment, 817 subjects were presented with either interactively controllable graphics on the spread of COVID-19 and information that enable them to recognize how much the spread of COVID-19 is reduced by physical distancing (experimental group) or text-based information about quantitative evidence (control group). It was hypothesized that participants receiving interactive information on the prevention of COVID-19 infections show a significantly higher willingness to comply with future containment measures than participants reading the text-based information. Explorative analyses were conducted to examine whether other factors influence compliance. RESULTS: As predicted, we found a small effect (d = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.11; 0.23, p < .001) for the tested intervention. The exploratory analysis suggests a decline in compliance later in the study (r = -0.10, 95% CI: -0.15; -0.07). Another significant predictor of change in compliance was health-related anxiety, but the effect was trivial. CONCLUSIONS: When presented interactively, information on how the own behavior can help prevent infectious diseases can lead to slightly stronger changes in attitude towards behavioral prevention measures than just text-based information. Given the scalability of this simple internet-based intervention, it could play a role in fostering compliance during a pandemic within universal prevention strategies.

"Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: Addictive social media use, depression, anxiety and stress in quarantine - an exploratory study in Germany and Lithuania","Brailovskaia, J.; Truskauskaite-Kuneviciene, I.; Margraf, J.; Kazlauskas, E.","BACKGROUND: To slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments of many countries introduced various behavioral measures starting March 2020. The measures included domestic quarantine (not leaving home) for infected or potentially infected people. Due to the need for social distancing, online activity increased in spring 2020. This could foster the risk for addictive social media use (SMU). The present study investigated tendencies of addictive SMU and their relationship with depression, anxiety and stress symptoms specifically among individuals who stayed in domestic quarantine due to COVID-19 in Germany and Lithuania. METHODS: In Germany (N = 529; quarantine group: n = 157, non-quarantine group: n = 372) and in Lithuania (N = 325; quarantine group: n = 54, non-quarantine group: n = 271), data were assessed via online surveys in spring 2020. RESULTS: In both countries, persons in quarantine had higher levels of addictive SMU, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms than individuals who were not in quarantine. The difference was significant only for addictive SMU in the German sample. The significant positive correlations between addictive SMU and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were stronger in both quarantine groups than in the non-quarantine groups. LIMITATIONS: The mostly female, young and well-educated composition of both investigated samples limits generalizability of the current findings.

Effects of Electrical Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation on the Perceived Intensity of Repetitive Painful Heat Stimuli: A Blinded Placebo- and Sham-Controlled Randomized Crossover Investigation,"Janner, H.; Klausenitz, C.; Gurtler, N.; Hahnenkamp, K.; Usichenko, T. I.","BACKGROUND: Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (TVNS) is a promising treatment for acute and chronic pain. However, experimental studies yielded controversial results. We examined if TVNS reduces the perceived intensity of repetitive painful heat stimulation and temporal summation of pain (TSP) in healthy volunteers in comparison with placebo and sham stimulation, as well as no intervention. METHODS: In 4 sessions, 90 heat pulse stimuli at individual pain tolerance temperature were applied to the ventral forearm of 49 healthy volunteers (25 women) using a Contact Heat Evoked Potential Stimulator thermode (Medoc, Ramat Yishai, Israel). Pain intensity was assessed with verbal ratings on a numeric pain scale (0-100) at every tenth heat pulse. After the first session in which pain intensities without intervention were evaluated, participants completed 3 sessions in a single-blinded randomized crossover manner: (1) sham stimulation applied at the earlobes, (2) placebo stimulation (inactive device), or (3) TVNS applied at the cymbas conchae. Primary data were analyzed using analysis of variance for repeated measures and t test for paired samples. RESULTS: Pain intensity decreased during all interventions as compared to no intervention (etap = 0.22, P < .001; mean difference TVNS versus no intervention 9.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-15.4; P < .001). Hypoalgesic effect of TVNS was better than that of placebo and sham in men before the onset of TSP (mean differences for TVNS versus placebo 6.2; 95% CI, 0.2-12.1; TVNS versus sham 6.2; 95% CI, 0.2-12.1; P < .05). In women, TSP response under TVNS was decreased if compared to no intervention (median difference, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.5-15.0; P = .003).

However, impairments in these domains lead to an increased probability for relapse and are thus highly relevant in treatment contexts. METHOD: This cross-sectional study assessed distinct aspects of social cognition and social problem solving in 31 hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and 30 matched healthy controls (HC). Three ecologically valid scenario-based tests were used to gauge the ability to infer the mental state of story characters in complicated interpersonal situations, the capacity to select the best problem solving strategy among other less optimal alternatives, and the ability to freely generate appropriate strategies to handle difficult interpersonal conflicts. Standardized tests were used to assess executive function, attention, trait empathy, and memory, and correlations were computed between measures of executive function, attention, trait empathy, and tests of social problem solving. RESULTS: AUD patients generated significantly fewer socially sensitive and practically effective solutions for problematic interpersonal situations than the HC group. Furthermore, patients performed significantly worse when asked to select the best alternative among a list of presented alternatives for scenarios containing sarcastic remarks and had significantly more problems to interpret sarcastic remarks in difficult interpersonal situations.

Maintenance of treatment effects of an occupation-based intervention with video feedback for adults with TBI,"Schmidt, J.; Fleming, J.; Ownsworth, T.; Lannin, N. A.","BACKGROUND: Video feedback interventions have been found to improve self-awareness and occupational performance to a greater extent than other feedback interventions after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, it is unclear whether the effects of video feedback are maintained over time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the maintenance of gains in self-awareness achieved with a video feedback intervention in people with TBI. METHODS: There were 32 participants with TBI and impaired self-awareness who had completed a randomized controlled trial with three feedback conditions (video plus verbal, verbal and experiential). Eight to ten weeks after the final feedback intervention session, a follow-up assessment was conducted. The primary outcome was maintenance of gains in online awareness measured by the number of errors made during a meal preparation task. Group outcomes were compared using an unstructured linear mixed regression model. RESULTS: The video plus verbal feedback group continued to demonstrate significantly greater gains in online awareness compared to the verbal feedback group (mean difference 20.6, 95% CI 8.8 to 32.3) and the experiential feedback group (mean difference 14.4, 95% CI 3.1 to 25.6). There was no significant impact of the interventions on participants' emotional status at the 8 to 10 week follow-up.

"Visual Attention to Sexual Stimuli in Women With Clinical, Subclinical, and Normal Sexual Functioning: An Eye-Tracking Study","Velten, J.; Milani, S.; Margraf, J.; Brotto, L. A.","BACKGROUND: Visual attention to sexual stimuli is an important means to facilitate sexual arousal and is thereby relevant for healthy sexual functioning. Experimental studies suggest that sexual dysfunction is associated with less attention toward sexual stimuli. AIM: The goal of this study was to use an eye-tracking-based free-viewing paradigm to investigate whether women in the clinical range of sexual function attend to a genital area in visual sexual stimuli differently than women with subclinical sexual function or those with normal sexual functioning. METHODS: Toward this goal, 69 women (M(age) = 27.77, SD = 8.00, range = 19-54) with clinical (n = 30), subclinical (n = 23), and normal (n = 16) levels of sexual functioning watched a series of 10 pictures depicting heterosexual couples during vaginal intercourse while their eye movements were recorded. Each picture was presented twice-once with a distracting object (eg, a to-do list or household appliance) present in the picture and once without-for 8 seconds, each. OUTCOMES: 5 eye-tracking measures indicative of different aspects of initial and sustained attention were analyzed. RESULTS: As hypothesized, 3 out of 5 eye-tracking measures (ie, first fixation duration, number of first fixations, and total fixation duration) indicated that women in the clinical group attended less to the genital area in the pictures than women with normal sexual functioning. For 2 indices (ie, first fixation duration and total fixation duration), women with subclinical (vs normal) sexual functioning also attended less to the genital area. In contrast to our hypothesis, the presence of a distracting object did not influence attention to the genital area in either of the sexual function groups. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study provides further evidence of the role of attentional biases in sexual dysfunction in women. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Eye-tracking methodology allows for a continuous measurement of visual attention; this is one of the first studies using this methodology to assess differences in visual attention in women with and without sexual dysfunction. However, the cross-sectional nature of this study prevents causal interpretation of findings. CONCLUSION: Future studies should use experimental paradigms to determine the causal role of visual attention for the development or maintenance of sexual dysfunction.

The Relevance of Emotion Regulation in Explaining Why Social Exclusion Triggers Paranoia in Individuals at Clinical High Risk of Psychosis,"Lincoln, T. M.; Sundag, J.; Schlier, B.; Karow, A.","BACKGROUND: Vulnerability-stress models postulate that social stress triggers psychotic episodes in vulnerable individuals. However, experimental evidence for the proposed causal pathway is scarce and the translating mechanisms are insufficiently understood. The study assessed the impact of social exclusion on paranoid beliefs in a quasi-experimental design and investigated the role of emotion regulation (ER) as a vulnerability indicator and emotional responses as a putative translating mechanism. METHODS: Participants fulfilling criteria for clinical high risk of psychosis (CHR, n = 25), controls with anxiety disorders (AC, n = 40), and healthy controls (HC, n = 40) were assessed for dysfunctional (eg, rumination, catastrophizing, blaming) and functional ER-strategies (eg, reappraising, accepting, refocusing). They were then exposed to social exclusion during a virtual ball game (Cyberball) and assessed for changes in self-reported emotions and paranoid beliefs. RESULTS: The CHR sample showed a significantly stronger increase in paranoid beliefs from before to after the social exclusion than both control groups. This was accounted for by lower levels of functional and higher levels of dysfunctional ER (compared to HC) and by a stronger increase in self-reported negative emotion in the CHR group (compared to AC and HC). CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the role of negative emotion on the pathway from social stressors to psychotic symptoms and indicate that both the use of dysfunctional ER strategies and difficulties in employing functional strategies add to explaining why people at risk of psychosis respond to a social stressor with increased paranoia.",2018,Jun 6,Schizophr Bull,44,4,757-767,29878274.0,10.1093/schbul/sbx135,,#716,Lincoln 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
How the integration of normal medical test results can be improved in patients with somatoform disorders-An experimental study,"Kube, T.; Riecke, J.; Heider, J.; Ballou, S. K.; Glombiewski, J. A.; Rief, W.; Barsky, A. J.","BACKGROUND: We examined whether the difficulties of patients with somatoform disorders (SFDs) in integrating medical reassurance can be altered by preventing patients from devaluing reassuring information through defensive cognitive strategies. METHOD: Patients with SFD (n = 60), patients with major depression (n = 32), and healthy volunteers (n = 37) watched a videotaped doctor's report, which provided medical reassurance for gastroenterological complaints. Subsequently, participants were asked about their perception of the report. In the SFD sample, patients' appraisal of the reassuring was experimentally modulated: In one condition, doubts about the validity of the doctor's diagnostic assessment were triggered; in another condition, the devaluation of medical reassurance was blocked through underscoring the validity of the doctor's diagnostic assessment; and a control condition received no manipulation. RESULTS: As evident on all outcome variables, patients with SFD had more difficulty integrating medical reassurance than depressed and healthy people. Within the SFD sample, participants from the experimental condition blocking the devaluation of medical reassurance rated the likelihood of an undetected serious disease to be significantly lower than the other two conditions. They also reported less emotional concern and a lower desire to seek the opinion of another doctor. CONCLUSIONS: By comparing patients with SFD to both a healthy and a clinical control group, the current study suggests that the difficulty in processing reassuring medical information is a specific psychopathological feature of SFD. Furthermore, our results suggest that the integration of medical reassurance can be improved by preventing patients from devaluing reassuring information through dismissive cognitive strategies.

Selected Trends in Psychotherapy Research: An Index Analysis of RCTs,"Rief, W.; Kopp, M.; Awarzamani, R.; Weise, C.","BACKGROUND: We wanted to analyze trends in psychotherapy research during the last decade. We used published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that are cited in Web of Science (WoS) as an index for these activities. METHOD: We searched for RCTs published between the years 2010 and 2019. Search criteria included cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT), e-mental health, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), psychodynamic treatments, interpersonal therapy (IPT), schema therapy, systemic therapy, mindfulness treatments, and emotion-focused therapy (EFT). The numbers of publications for each treatment approach were accumulated for 5-year blocks (2010 to 2014; 2015 to 2019). RESULTS: The search revealed 4,523 hits for the selected treatment options, of which 1,605 were finally included in the analysis. There was a continuous increase in published RCTs, with 68% more trials during the second five-year block. CBT (68%) and eHealth interventions (18%) show an increase in the number of studies, but there were no significant changes in its percentage in relation to all published RCTs. The next frequent treatments were ACT (4%), psychodynamic treatments (2%), IPT (2%), and mindfulness interventions (2%). We found a significant increase of the percentage of mindfulness (p = .008) and a significant decrease of the percentage of psychodynamic treatments (p = .02). Systemic (1.1%), emotion-focused (0.7%) and schema therapy (0.6%) represented smaller parts of published RCTs. CONCLUSION: A continuous increase of published RCTs underlines an active field of research on psychological interventions.

Drivers and Barriers to Acceptance of Web-Based Aftercare of Patients in Inpatient Routine Care: A Cross-Sectional Survey,"Hennemann, S.; Beutel, M. E.; Zwerenz, R.","BACKGROUND: Web-based aftercare can help to stabilize treatment effects and support transition after inpatient treatment, yet uptake by patients seems limited in routine care and little is known about the mechanisms of adoption and implementation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to (1) determine acceptance of Web-based aftercare and (2) explore its drivers and barriers in different subgroups of a mixed inpatient sample. METHOD: In a cross-sectional design, 38.3% (374/977) of the inpatients from a broad spectrum of diagnostic groups (psychosomatic, cardiologic, orthopedic, pediatric, and substance-related disorders) filled out a self-administered questionnaire prior to discharge. Drivers and barriers to patients' acceptance of Web-based aftercare were examined based on an extension to the ""unified theory of acceptance and use of technology"" (UTAUT). In total, 16.7% (59/353) of the participants indicated prior use of eHealth interventions. RESULTS: Acceptance (min 1, max 5) was low (mean 2.56, SD 1.22) and differed between diagnostic groups (Welch F(4,133.10) =7.77, P<.001), with highest acceptance in adolescent patients (mean 3.46, SD 1.42). Acceptance was significantly predicted by 3 UTAUT predictors: social influence (beta=.39, P<.001), performance expectancy (beta=.31, P<.001), and effort expectancy (beta=.22, P<.001). Furthermore, stress due to permanent availability (beta=-.09, P=.01) was negatively associated with acceptance. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a limited acceptance of Web-based aftercare in inpatients. Expectations, social environment's attitude, and negative experience with permanent availability influence eHealth acceptance. Improving implementation, therefore, means increasing eHealth experience and literacy and facilitating positive attitudes in patients and health professionals through education and reduction of misconceptions about effectiveness or usability.",2016,Dec 23,J Med Internet Res,18,12,e337,28011445.0,10.2196/jmir.6003,,#721,Hennemann 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Defining and Predicting Patterns of Early Response in a Web-Based Intervention for Depression,"Lutz, W.; Arndt, A.; Rubel, J.; Berger, T.; Schroder, J.; Spath, C.; Meyer, B.; Greiner, W.; Grafe, V.; Hautzinger, M.; Fuhr, K.; Rose, M.; Nolte, S.; Lowe, B.; Hohagen, F.; Klein, J.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to examine the early change patterns in Web-based interventions to identify differential effects. METHODS: We applied piecewise growth mixture modeling (PGMM) to identify different latent classes of early change in individuals with mild-to-moderate depression (n=409) who underwent a CBT-based web intervention for depression. RESULTS: Overall, three latent classes were identified (N=409): Two early response classes (n=158, n=185) and one early deterioration class (n=66). Latent classes differed in terms of outcome (P<.001) and adherence (P=.03) in regard to the number of modules (number of modules with a duration of at least 10 minutes) and the number of assessments (P<.001), but not in regard to the overall amount of time using the system. Class membership significantly improved outcome prediction by 24.8% over patient intake characteristics (P<.001) and significantly added to the prediction of adherence (P=.04).

"Efficacy of a Parent-Based, Indicated Prevention for Anorexia Nervosa: Randomized Controlled Trial","Jacobi, C.; Hutter, K.; Volker, U.; Mobius, K.; Richter, R.; Trockel, M.; Jones Bell, M.; Lock, J.; Taylor, C. B.","BACKGROUND: Web-based preventive interventions can reduce risk and incidence of bulimia and binge eating disorders among young high-risk women. However, their specific effects on core symptoms of anorexia nervosa (AN) are rather weak. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an indicated, parent-based, Web-based preventive program Eltern als Therapeuten (E@T) in reducing risk factors and symptoms of AN. METHODS: Girls aged between 11 and 17 years were screened by selected risk factors and early symptoms of AN. At-risk families were then randomized to E@T or an assessment-only control condition. Assessments took place at pre- and postintervention (6 weeks later) and at 6- and 12-month follow-up (FU). RESULTS: A total of 12,377 screening questionnaires were handed out in 86 German schools, and 3941 including consent returned. Overall, 477 (447/3941, 12.10%) girls were identified as at risk for AN and 256 of those could be contacted. In all, 66 families (66/256, 25.8% of those contacted) were randomized to the E@T or a wait-list control condition, 43 (43/66, 65%) participated in postassessments, and 27 (27/66, 41%) in 12-month FUs. Due to low participation and high dropout rates of parents, recruitment was terminated prematurely. At 12-month FU, girls' expected body weight (EBW) percentage was significantly greater for intervention participants compared with control participants (group by time interaction beta=21.0 [CI 5.81 to 36.13], P=.007; group by time squared interaction beta=-15.5 [CI -26.6 to -4.49], P=.007; estimated Cohen d=0.42]. No other significant effects were found on risk factors and attitudes of disturbed eating. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a significant increase in girls' EBW percentage, parental participation and adherence to the intervention were low. Overall, parent-based, indicated prevention for children at risk for AN does not seem very promising, although it might be useful for parents who engage in the intervention.

Validation of a German Version of the Grief Cognitions Questionnaire and Establishment of a Short Form,"Doering, B. K.; Boelen, P. A.; Eisma, M. C.; Barke, A.","BACKGROUND: Whereas the majority of bereaved persons recover from their grief without professional assistance, a minority develops pathological grief reactions. Etiological models postulate that dysfunctional cognitions may perpetuate such reactions. The Grief Cognitions Questionnaire (GCQ) assesses thoughts after bereavement in nine interrelated domains. A short form (GCQ-SF) with four domains is often used. However, an evaluation of the psychometric properties of the GCQ-SF and its utility compared to the GCQ is lacking and these instruments have not been validated in German. METHOD: German bereaved persons (time since loss 35.3 +/- 34.6 months) responded to an online survey containing the GCQ, measures of grief severity, grief rumination, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and optimism and pessimism. 585 participants (18-78 years, 88% women) were included. Item analyses and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Correlations between the GCQ and GCQ-SF and grief rumination, optimism and pessimism assessed construct validity. Criterion-related validity was assessed by comparing whether the correlation of the GCQ (and the GCQ-SF) with grief severity was higher than with anxious and depressive symptoms. Logistic regression and receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) compared the questionnaires on their ability to predict probable prolonged grief 'caseness' (ICG >/= 25, time since loss >/=6 months). RESULTS: Internal consistencies for both questionnaires were identical and excellent (alpha = 0.96). Confirmatory factor analyses obtained a satisfactory fit for models with nine and four correlated subscales and respective higher-order factor models. The GCQ and the GCQ-SF correlated higher with grief severity than with other measures of psychopathology. The logistic regression showed a significant association between the GCQ-SF and prolonged grief 'caseness'. Of the remaining subscales of the GCQ, only one subscale ('Others') contributed to the prediction. The ROC analyses showed nearly identical areas under the curve. CONCLUSION: The translated GCQ and GCQ-SF demonstrated very good psychometric properties. The correlations with grief severity highlight the questionnaires' clinical relevance. The questionnaires possessed identical diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. Whenever a timesaving assessment of the most typical grief-specific cognitions is important, the GCQ-SF represents an alternative to the GCQ. The original GCQ may still be superior when a more detailed description of a bereaved person's cognitions is desirable.",2020,2021/01/18,Front Psychol,11,,620987,33536985.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.620987,,#724,Doering 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
go4cognition: Combined Physiological and Cognitive Intervention in Mild Cognitive Impairment,"Lissek, V. J.; Ben Abdallah, H.; Praetorius, A.; Ohmann, T.; Suchan, B.","BACKGROUND: While cognitive interventions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) show positive effects on cognitive performance, physical activity appear to slow down cognitive decline, suggesting a relationship between both factors. However, previous combined programs that have shown significant improvement in cognitive function in MCI have typically trained cognition and physical functioning separately. OBJECTIVE: This project aimed at evaluating two group interventions combining the stimulation of physical and cognitive domains in individuals with MCI: Simultaneous stimulation of physical and cognitive skills in comparison to a standardized training, which stimulates cognitive and physical functions separately. METHODS: The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. The first group was trained on the SpeedCourt(R) system while the second group completed the standardized Fitfor100 program. Training was completed by a total of 39 subjects with diagnosed MCI as determined by the CERAD (SpeedCourt(R): 24 subjects, Fitfor100:15 individuals). RESULTS: There were significant improvements of physical factors (e.g., hand strength and balance) in both groups. Improvement in the CERAD total score allowed for a post interventional classification of all participants into non-MCI and MCI. This effect persisted over a period of three months. Both forms of intervention were found to be effective in improving various cognitive functions which persisted for a period of three months.

Return to work and depressive symptoms in young stroke survivors after six and twelve months: cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses,"Volz, M.; Ladwig, S.; Werheid, K.","BACKGROUND: While depression after stroke is common and stroke prevalence globally increases in working age populations, the role of return-to-work (RTW) in the pathogenesis of post-stroke depression (PSD) remains unclear. This study examined if RTW is linked to PSD within the first year after ischemic stroke, independently from established risk factors. METHOD: Stroke survivors (n = 176) in their working age (<65 years) recruited from two rehabilitation clinics were assessed for established risk factors: pre-stroke depression, activities of daily living, stroke severity, cognitive impairment, and social support. RTW and depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale: GDS-15) were assessed six- and twelve-months post-stroke. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between RTW and GDS-15, while controlling for established PSD risk factors. RESULTS: Successful RTW was independently associated with lower GDS-15 at both measurement occasions (p < .05), next to the absence of pre-stroke depression and higher social support. Stroke severity predicted GDS-15 at twelve months. The predictive value of six-months RTW for subsequent depressive symptoms beyond the influence of established risk factors was ss = -1.73 (p = .09). DISCUSSION: RTW was independently associated with PSD in young stroke survivors within the first-year post-stroke, and exerted a (marginally significant) effect on subsequent depression. Our study highlights the relevance of RTW for young stroke survivors' PSD, beyond the influence of established risk factors. Further assessments examining to what extent fostering RTW contributes to mental well-being after stroke might be promising for PSD prevention, next to evident beneficial economic effects.",2023,Apr,Top Stroke Rehabil,30,3,263-271,35068384.0,10.1080/10749357.2022.2026562,,#727,Volz 2023,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Homesickness in asylum seekers: The role of mental health and migration-related factors,"Rosner, R.; Hagl, M.; Bucheler, L.; Comtesse, H.","BACKGROUND: While homesickness in refugees is a recurring theme in clinical practice, respective research in this population is scarce. The Utrecht Homesickness Scale (UHS) allows distinguishing between certain aspects of homesickness, namely genuine separation distress like missing family and friends or yearning for home on the one side and problems regarding adjustment to the new situation on the other; so far, the instrument was applied mainly in samples of university students, and never in refugees. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore homesickness in a refugee population and its association with mental health symptoms and migration-related factors. In addition, we wanted to evaluate the UHS's factor structure in a sample other than students. METHODS: Individuals from different countries (N = 99) seeking asylum in Germany were assessed for homesickness, migration-related variables (e.g., number of losses and stage of the asylum proceedings), and mental health symptoms (symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress and prolonged grief). After exploratory factor analysis, standardized mean factors scores were fed into subsequent correlational and regression analyses to identify the most prominent predictors of homesickness scores. RESULTS: The participants showed substantial levels of homesickness. We found a three-factor solution that implied distinct factors regarding (1) adjustment difficulties and loneliness, (2) ruminations about home, and (3) missing family and/or friends. The total homesickness score was associated with mental health but regression analyses with the three mean factor scores showed differential associations with mental health and migration-related variables. While adjustment difficulties and loneliness were-besides time since arrival in Germany-associated with mental health problems (depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms), ruminating about home was predicted by migration-related variables (number of losses and asylum status). For the factor scores regarding missing family and/or friends, the regression model was not significant.

Typologies of posttraumatic stress disorder in treatment-seeking older adults,"Bottche, M.; Pietrzak, R. H.; Kuwert, P.; Knaevelsrud, C.","BACKGROUND: While it is well known that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by heterogeneous symptom clusters, little is known about predominant typologies of PTSD symptoms in older adults. METHODS: Latent profile analyses (LPAs) were employed to evaluate predominant typologies of PTSD symptoms in a sample of 164 treatment-seeking older adults with childhood war-related trauma. Multinomial logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate predictors of class membership. RESULTS: LPAs revealed that a 3-class solution best fit the data. These included an Intermediate Disturbance class (50.0%) and two Pervasive Disturbance classes, which differed with respect to severity of avoidance symptoms (Pervasive Disturbance-Low Avoidance: 33.5%, Pervasive Disturbance-High Avoidance: 16.5%). A greater number of traumatic events predicted membership in the Pervasive Disturbance classes. The Pervasive Disturbance-Low Avoidance class had a higher level of education than the Pervasive Disturbance-High Avoidance class. Compared to the Intermediate Disturbance class, the Pervasive Disturbance classes had the highest levels of depression, anxiety and somatization symptoms. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PTSD in treatment-seeking older adults may be characterized by three predominant typologies, which are differentiated by overall severity and avoidance symptoms, lifetime trauma burden, education level, and comorbid depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms.

Convergent and Discriminant Validity of the Test of Passive Aggression in a Psychotherapy Outpatient Sample,"Schanz, C. G.; Equit, M.; Schafer, S. K.; Michael, T.","Background: While most clinical aggression questionnaires focus on the assessment of active aggression, the recently developed Test of Passive Aggression (TPA) assesses both self-directed (TPA-SD) and other-directed passive aggression (TPA-OD). Reliability and factorial validity of the TPA have been demonstrated in a clinical sample, while previous evaluations of convergent and discriminant validity were limited to student samples. The current study aimed at addressing this gap by demonstrating convergent and discriminant validity of the TPA in an outpatient sample. Methods: Eighty-two patients admitted to an outpatient psychotherapy unit at Saarland University, Germany, participated in the preregistered study with an assessment of self-reported passive aggression, impulsivity, anger expression, self-compassion, self-esteem, and auto-aggressive mindset. Analyses used regression models with robust maximum likelihood estimations. Results: Self-directed passive aggression showed a significant association with self-compassion, auto-aggressive mindset, self-esteem, and internal anger expression supporting the convergent validity of TPA-SD. Results on discriminant validity of TPA-SD were heterogenous at the first sight, revealing small associations of self-directed passive aggression with anger control but medium associations with impulsivity. However, exploratory analysis showed that the medium association with impulsivity was driven by the non-behavioral impulsivity dimension ""inattention"" and that both behavioral impulsivity dimensions (""motor-impulsivity"" and ""unplanned behavior"") demonstrated only weak associations with TPA-SD. Validity of TPA-OD was not supported by the current study. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence for the validity of the TPA-SD to outpatient samples.

Efficacy of an integrative CBT for prolonged grief disorder: A long-term follow-up,"Rosner, R.; Bartl, H.; Pfoh, G.; Kotoucova, M.; Hagl, M.","BACKGROUND: While some intervention trials have demonstrated efficacy in treating prolonged grief disorder (PGD), data on long-term treatment effects are scarce. METHODS: Fifty-one outpatients with clinically relevant prolonged grief symptoms, who had participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), were followed up, on average, 1.5 years after integrative cognitive behavioral therapy for PGD (PG-CBT). Initial assessment procedures were repeated, with PGD symptom severity as the main outcome and general mental health symptoms as secondary outcomes. As results in the immediate and delayed treatment groups (former wait list) were similar, the follow-up data were pooled. RESULTS: Overall, 80% of the original ITT sample could be reached, that is 89% of the 37 treated participants, as well as 8 out of 14 participants who had dropped out of the RCT. The considerable short-term treatment success of PG-CBT was stable; pre to follow-up Cohen׳s d was large, with 1.24 in the ITT analysis and 2.22 for completers. The pre to post-improvement in overall mental health was maintained. LIMITATIONS: Since the RCT wait list group had been treated after their waiting period as well, no controlled long-term outcomes are available. CONCLUSIONS: PG-CBT proved to be effective in the longer run. In comparison to other RCTs on prolonged grief this is the largest sample followed up for this long.",2015,Sep 1,J Affect Disord,183,,106-12,26001670.0,10.1016/j.jad.2015.04.051,,#732,Rosner 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
How to quantify exposure to traumatic stress? Reliability and predictive validity of measures for cumulative trauma exposure in a post-conflict population,"Wilker, S.; Pfeiffer, A.; Kolassa, S.; Koslowski, D.; Elbert, T.; Kolassa, I. T.","BACKGROUND: While studies with survivors of single traumatic experiences highlight individual response variation following trauma, research from conflict regions shows that almost everyone develops posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if trauma exposure reaches extreme levels. Therefore, evaluating the effects of cumulative trauma exposure is of utmost importance in studies investigating risk factors for PTSD. Yet, little research has been devoted to evaluate how this important environmental risk factor can be best quantified. METHODS: We investigated the retest reliability and predictive validity of different trauma measures in a sample of 227 Ugandan rebel war survivors. Trauma exposure was modeled as the number of traumatic event types experienced or as a score considering traumatic event frequencies. In addition, we investigated whether age at trauma exposure can be reliably measured and improves PTSD risk prediction. RESULTS: All trauma measures showed good reliability. While prediction of lifetime PTSD was most accurate from the number of different traumatic event types experienced, inclusion of event frequencies slightly improved the prediction of current PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: As assessing the number of traumatic events experienced is the least stressful and time-consuming assessment and leads to the best prediction of lifetime PTSD, we recommend this measure for research on PTSD etiology.",2015,2015/11/19,Eur J Psychotraumatol,6,1,28306,26589255.0,10.3402/ejpt.v6.28306,,#733,Wilker 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Characteristics of participants in a randomized trial of an Internet intervention for depression (EVIDENT) in comparison to a national sample (DEGS1),"Spath, C.; Hapke, U.; Maske, U.; Schroder, J.; Moritz, S.; Berger, T.; Meyer, B.; Rose, M.; Nolte, S.; Klein, J. P.","BACKGROUND: While the efficacy of Internet interventions for depression has been demonstrated in numerous studies, there is concern that the participants in these studies may systematically differ from depressed subjects in the general population. The goal of this study was to compare participants in a large trial of an Internet intervention for depression with a population-based sample that reported depressive symptomatology in the same range of severity. METHODOLOGY: The analysis is based on a sample of participants of a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of an Internet intervention for depression in mild to moderate depression (EVIDENT, N = 1013) and a subsample of participants in a representative population-based sample (DEGS1, n = 1978). The DEGS1 subsample was chosen based on the score in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9, score 5-14) as this was the main inclusion criterion for the EVIDENT study. Both samples were compared with respect to a range of demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: Compared with the DEGS1 subsample, participants in the EVIDENT sample were significantly more often female (68.6% vs. 56.3%), slightly older (mean age 42.9 vs. 40.4 years), had more often completed highest secondary education (51.3% vs. 22.4%), were clinically more severely affected (moderate depressive symptoms in 62.6% vs. 18.3%) and reported a lower quality of life. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that participants in this Internet trial were not just internet savvy young males without significant impairment. Future studies should aim to recruit participants with lower educational status to increase the reach of Internet interventions.",2017,Sep,Internet Interv,9,,46-50,30135836.0,10.1016/j.invent.2017.05.003,,#734,Spath 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Regulating negative emotions of others reduces own stress: Neurobiological correlates and the role of individual differences in empathy,"Guendelman, S.; Bayer, M.; Prehn, K.; Dziobek, I.","BACKGROUND: While witnessing the suffering of other people results in personal distress, it is not clear whether regulating others' emotions in such situations also comes at an emotional cost for the observer. METHODS: This study included 62 subjects and used a newly developed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) paradigm to investigate mechanisms of self and other emotion regulation via reappraisal while the subject and an interaction partner outside the scanner were facing the same distressing situation simultaneously. The relationship between distress levels and individual differences in emotional and cognitive empathy were also assessed. RESULTS: We found that individuals exhibited especially high levels of personal distress when relating with a partner while both being exposed to aversive photographs and that especially highly empathetic individuals were prone to such personal distress. Moreover, when engaging in social emotion regulation, personal distress was reduced in the observer at a similar rate as in self emotion regulation. FMRI analyses revealed increased activation for other vs. self emotion regulation in the precuneus and the left temporo-parietal junction, which are commonly engaged in social cognition. Furthermore, this activation was associated with lower self-reported stress and decreased sympathetic autonomic activity. While regulating others, precuneus activation exhibited a distinctive functional connectivity profile with parietal emotion regulation regions. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates benefits of actively regulating another person's emotions for reducing one's own distress and identifies the precuneus as an important node for social emotion regulation. Given the novelty of the study design, the results are of exploratory and preliminary nature.",2022,Jul 1,NeuroImage,254,,119134,35351648.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119134,,#735,Guendelman 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Trapped in my inner prison-Cross-sectional examination of internal and external entrapment, hopelessness and suicidal ideation","Holler, I.; Kremers, A.; Schreiber, D.; Forkmann, T.","BACKGROUND: Within the integrated motivational-volitional model of suicidal behavior, entrapment that consecutively leads to hopelessness is considered as a proximal risk factor for suicidal ideation. Entrapment can refer to both external and internal circumstances whereby results of recent studies indicate that internal entrapment plays a more important role than external entrapment in the development of suicidal ideation. It has been considered that to escape internal entrapment might be more complicated than to change external circumstances. However, it remains unclear whether the greater effect of internal entrapment on suicidal ideation is due to greater feelings of hopelessness. Therefore, the aim of this study was to address this research gap and to examine the effects of internal and external entrapment on hopelessness and suicidal ideation. METHODS: N = 454 participants from a community sample (75% female) aged between 18 and 73 years (M = 29.91, SD = 11.56) conducted a cross-sectional online survey. All participants were assessed for suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and internal as well as external entrapment. Pearson product-moment correlations and two mediation analyses were conducted. RESULTS: All constructs were significantly correlated. For both internal and external entrapment, an effect on suicidal ideation was found. Both effects were partially mediated by hopelessness, this mediation was larger for external entrapment. The completely standardized indirect effect used to compare the mediation models was larger for external entrapment than for internal entrapment. CONCLUSIONS: Hopelessness mediated the association between external entrapment as well as internal entrapment and suicidal ideation. This effect was larger for external entrapment.",2022,2022/07/19,PLOS ONE,17,7,e0270985,35852991.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0270985,,#736,Holler 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Social media use, mental health, and suicide-related outcomes in Russian women: A cross-sectional comparison between two age groups","Brailovskaia, J.; Krasavtseva, Y.; Kochetkov, Y.; Tour, P.; Margraf, J.","BACKGROUND: Women who belong to the age group ""emerging adulthood"" (18 to 29 years) are vulnerable to mental health issues and suicide-related outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated potential predictors of suicide-related outcomes in females emerging adulthood and compared them to older women. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data of 2537 women from Russia (group ""18 to 29 years"": n = 1123; group ""> 29 years"": n = 1414) on lifetime suicide-related outcomes, (problematic) social media use, daily stress, depression and anxiety symptoms, and positive mental health were assessed via online cross-sectional surveys. RESULTS: The younger group spent significantly more time on social media use than the older group. It had significantly higher levels of daily stress, problematic social media use, depression and anxiety symptoms, and suicide-related outcomes. The older group showed significantly higher levels of positive mental health. Only in the younger group, problematic social media use significantly mediated the relationship between daily stress and suicide-related outcomes in a moderated mediation analysis. Positive mental health significantly moderated the association between problematic social media use and suicide-related outcomes. Specifically, the higher the positive mental health level, the less close the link between both variables. CONCLUSION: The current results reveal that young women in Russia could be at enhanced risk for daily stress, problematic social media use, and low levels of mental health. The interaction between these variables could foster suicide-related outcomes.

Sources of social support for postpartum women with a history of childhood maltreatment: Consequences for perceived stress and general mental health in the first year after birth,"Hitzler, M.; Behnke, A.; Gundel, H.; Ziegenhain, U.; Kindler, H.; Kolassa, I. T.; Zimmermann, J.","BACKGROUND: Women with a history of childhood maltreatment (CM) experience the postpartum period as particularly stressful and may benefit less from social support, implicating a higher risk for mental health problems and higher stress levels in mothers with CM. OBJECTIVE: Thus, we investigated the complex relationship of CM and social support provided by different sources (intimate partner, parents, parents-in-law, friends) in predicting stress perception and mental health over the course of the first year postpartum. PARTICIPANTS: In N = 295 postpartum women we assessed CM experiences, stress perception, perceived social support and general mental health 3 and 12 months postpartum. METHOD: Linear mixed effect models were used to examine the course of social support over the first year postpartum and path analyses were used to investigate mediation and moderation effects. RESULTS: We found that CM was linked to lower levels of perceived social support, accounted for more mental health problems, and amplified the negative association between perceived stress and maternal mental health. Most importantly, we showed that only partner support was beneficial for maternal mental health, and this association was mediated by reductions in perceived stress. CONCLUSION: CM as a major risk factor for mental health impairs the stress resilience of affected postpartum women. Extending previous research, our results reveal that the source of postpartum social support determines its benefits for maternal health. Our findings emphasize the need of at-risk mothers to be provided with additional sources of support to cope with daily practical, organizational and emotional challenges.",2022,Dec,Child Abuse Negl,134,,105911,36191542.0,10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105911,,#738,Hitzler 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Self-reported workplace perception as indicators of work anxieties,"Muschalla, B.; Fay, D.; Linden, M.","BACKGROUND: Work anxiety is a potentially disabling mental health problem, which can cause (long-term) sickness absence. In many cases patients do not openly report their anxieties and tend to give externalizing explanations of inner problems. Therefore people with work anxiety may perceive their workplace more negatively than those without such anxiety. AIMS: To investigate the relation between subjective work description and work anxiety. METHODS: Work anxiety was investigated with a standardized interview in a sample of employed psychosomatic rehabilitation inpatients suffering from common mental disorders. We assessed their subjective perception and evaluation of workplace conditions with the 'Short Questionnaire for Job Analysis' (KFZA) and compared their results with those from a sample of employees in the general population. RESULTS: There were 148 inpatient participants and 8015 general population controls. Patients with work anxiety described their workplace significantly more negatively than patients without work anxiety and employees in the general population, with no differences in workplace descriptions between psychosomatic patients without work anxiety and the general population sample. The type of complaint about work conditions was related to the specific type of work anxiety.

Negative work perception not changed in a short work-anxiety-coping group therapy intervention,"Muschalla, B.","BACKGROUND: Work anxiety is often associated with long-term sick leave and requires early intervention. Work anxieties are associated with negative work perception. Therefore, one aim in early intervention is a cognitive reframing of dysfunctional perceptions of workplace characteristics. METHODS: A psychotherapeutic specialist conducted two group programs of four sessions each. One hundred twenty-three rehabilitation in-patients with work anxieties were randomly assigned either to a work anxiety-coping group or to a recreational group. The Short Questionnaire for Work Analysis (KFZA) was administered before and after the group treatment to measure perceptions of working conditions. RESULTS: Participants from the work anxiety-coping group did not see their work in a significantly more positive light at the end of the intervention compared to participants from the recreational group. CONCLUSIONS: A short work anxiety-coping group did not initiate a consistent positive re-appraisal of work.

A concept of psychological work capacity demands: First evaluation in rehabilitation patients with and without mental disorders,"Muschalla, B.","BACKGROUND: Work capacity demands are a concept to describe which psychological capacities are required in a job. Assessing psychological work capacity demands is of specific importance when mental health problems at work endanger work ability. Exploring psychological work capacity demands is the basis for mental hazard analysis or rehabilitative action, e.g. in terms of work adjustmentOBJECTIVE:This is the first study investigating psychological work capacity demands in rehabilitation patients with and without mental disorders. METHODS: A structured interview on psychological work capacity demands (Mini-ICF-Work; Muschalla, 2015; Linden et al., 2015) was done with 166 rehabilitation patients of working age. All interviews were done by a state-licensed socio-medically trained psychotherapist. Inter-rater-reliability was assessed by determining agreement in independent co-rating in 65 interviews. For discriminant validity purposes, participants filled in the Short Questionnaire for Work Analysis (KFZA, Prumper et al., 1994). RESULTS: In different professional fields, different psychological work capacity demands were of importance. The Mini-ICF-Work capacity dimensions reflect different aspects than the KFZA. Patients with mental disorders were longer on sick leave and had worse work ability prognosis than patients without mental disorders, although both groups reported similar work capacity demands.

Chronic Abdominal Pain in Children and Adolescents: Parental Threat Perception Plays a Major Role in Seeking Medical Consultations,"Calvano, C.; Warschburger, P.","Background. Pain symptoms, associated impairment, and parental perception of threat are reported to be predictors of health care utilization (HCU) in childhood chronic abdominal pain (CAP). However, mediating variables and their interrelations have not yet been systematically studied. Objectives. This study aims to identify mediating pathways of influence between child's abdominal pain and the number of pain-related medical visits. Methods. In a multicenter study, we recruited N = 151 parent-child dyads with children aged 6-17 years suffering from CAP. A composite measure of pain symptoms was defined as predictor and the number of pain-related medical visits as outcome variable. This relation was analyzed by serial mediation, including child- and parent-reported impairment and parental threat perception as mediators. Results. Only parental threat perception significantly linked child's pain symptoms to the number of medical visits. Measures of impairment did not have a significant effect. Conclusions. Parental pain-related threat perception is strongly related to health care seeking in childhood CAP.

They were required to retrieve specific personal memories to positive or negative cue words during movement. Moreover, an incidental recall of the cue words was conducted. RESULTS: Patients in the upward-opening movement condition in contrast to the downward-closing movement condition showed a more positively biased recall of affective words and recalled more specific autobiographical memories.

METHODS: Comparison of emotion dysregulation in adults with a history of early abuse and neglect who developed either an SUD (n = 105) or no mental disorder (n = 54). Further, a mediation model for the association between the severity of early maltreatment and SUDs was tested. Participants completed research diagnostic interviews for psychopathology, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. RESULTS: By using hierarchical regression techniques and mediational analyses controlling for age and gender, it was possible to provide evidence for the mediating role of emotion dysregulation between early emotional and physical maltreatment and later SUDs.

"Effects of Maternal Anxiety Disorders on Infant Self-Comforting Behaviors: The Role of Maternal Bonding, Infant Gender and Age","Muller, M.; Tronick, E.; Zietlow, A. L.; Nonnenmacher, N.; Verschoor, S.; Trauble, B.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: We investigated the links between maternal bonding, maternal anxiety disorders, and infant self-comforting behaviors. Furthermore, we looked at the moderating roles of infant gender and age. METHODS: Our sample (n = 69) comprised 28 mothers with an anxiety disorder (according to DSM-IV criteria) and 41 controls, each with their 2.5- to 8-month-old infant (41 females and 28 males). Infant behaviors were recorded during the Face-to-Face Still-Face paradigm. Maternal bonding was assessed by the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire. RESULTS: Conditional process analyses revealed that lower maternal bonding partially mediated between maternal anxiety disorders and increased self-comforting behaviors but only in older female infants (over 5.5 months of age). However, considering maternal anxiety disorders without the influence of bonding, older female infants (over 5.5 months of age) showed decreased rates of self-comforting behaviors, while younger male infants (under 3 months of age) showed increased rates in the case of maternal anxiety disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that older female infants (over 5.5 months of age) are more sensitive to lower maternal bonding in the context of maternal anxiety disorders. Furthermore, results suggest a different use of self-directed regulation strategies for male and female infants of mothers with anxiety disorders and low bonding, depending on infant age.

From Memories of Past Experiences to Present Motivation? A Meta-analysis on the Association Between Episodic Memory and Negative Symptoms in People With Psychosis,"Pillny, M.; Krkovic, K.; Buck, L.; Lincoln, T. M.","Based on findings from cognitive science, it has been theorized that the reductions in motivation and goal-directed behavior in people with psychosis could stem from impaired episodic memory. In the current meta-analysis, we investigated this putative functional link between episodic memory deficits and negative symptoms. We hypothesized that episodic memory deficits in psychosis would be related to negative symptoms in general but would be more strongly related to amotivation than to reduced expressivity. We included 103 eligible studies (13,622 participants) in the analyses. Results revealed significant, moderate negative associations of episodic memory with negative symptoms in general (k = 103; r = -.23; z = -13.40; P </= .001; 95% CI [-.26; -.20]), with amotivation (k = 16; r = -.18; z = -6.6; P </= .001; 95% CI [-.23; -.13]) and with reduced expressivity (k = 15; r = -.18; z = -3.30; P </=.001; 95% CI[-.29; -.07]). These associations were not moderated by sociodemographic characteristics, positive symptoms, depression, antipsychotic medication or type of negative symptom scale. Although these findings provide sound evidence for the association between episodic memory deficits and amotivation, the rather small magnitude and the unspecific pattern of this relationship also indicate that episodic memory deficits are unlikely to be the only factor relevant to amotivation. This implicates that future research should investigate episodic memory in conjunction with other factors that could account for the association of episodic memory deficits and amotivation in psychosis.",2022,Mar 1,Schizophr Bull,48,2,307-324,34635918.0,10.1093/schbul/sbab120,,#753,Pillny 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Sitting posture makes a difference-embodiment effects on depressive memory bias,"Michalak, J.; Mischnat, J.; Teismann, T.","Basic research has shown that the motoric system (i.e., motor actions or stable postures) can strongly affect emotional processes. The present study sought to investigate the effects of sitting posture on the tendency of depressed individuals to recall a higher proportion of negative self-referent material. Thirty currently depressed inpatients either sat in a slumped (depressed) or in an upright (non-depressed) posture while imagining a visual scene of themselves in connection with positive or depression related words presented to them on a computer screen. An incidental recall test of these words was conducted after a distraction task.

Acute stress leaves fear generalization in healthy individuals intact,"Kausche, F. M.; Zerbes, G.; Kampermann, L.; Muller, J. C.; Wiedemann, K.; Buchel, C.; Schwabe, L.","Because threatening situations often occur in a similar manner, the generalization of fear to similar situations is adaptive and can avoid harm to the organism. However, the overgeneralization of fear to harmless stimuli is maladaptive and assumed to contribute to anxiety disorders. Thus, elucidating factors that may modulate fear (over)generalization is important. Based on the known effects of acute stress on learning, which are at least partly due to noradrenergic arousal, we investigated whether stress may promote fear overgeneralization and whether we could counteract this effect by reducing noradrenergic arousal. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subjects design, 120 healthy participants underwent a fear-conditioning procedure on Day 1. Approximately 24 hours later, participants received orally either a placebo or the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol and were exposed to a stress or control manipulation before they completed a test of fear generalization. Skin conductance responses as well as explicit rating data showed a successful acquisition of conditioned fear on Day 1 and a pronounced fear generalization 24 hours later. Although physiological data confirmed the successful stress manipulation and reduction of noradrenergic arousal, the extent of fear generalization remained unaffected by stress and propranolol. The absence of a stress effect on fear generalization was confirmed by a second study and a Bayesian analysis across both data sets. Our findings suggest that acute stress leaves fear generalization processes intact, at least in a sample of healthy, young individuals.",2021,Apr,Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci,21,2,372-389,33629258.0,10.3758/s13415-021-00874-0,,#755,Kausche 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

"Behavioral measures to fight COVID-19: An 8-country study of perceived usefulness, adherence and their predictors","Margraf, J.; Brailovskaia, J.; Schneider, S.","Behavioral measures, such as the wearing of facemasks and maintaining of distance to other people, have been central in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be important in curbing its spread. We therefore investigated their perceived usefulness, adherence and their predictors in representative online samples in eight countries (France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Of the 7,658 participants, 77.4% rated governmental measures (highest: Germany, lowest: France) as useful and 91.7% reported adherence to them. Adherence was lowest in Russia and Poland, where people felt particularly left alone and not well supported, and in the U.S. and Sweden, where governments showed ambivalent attitudes towards the measures. The highest adherence was reported in countries with very high mortality (U.K., Spain, France) or very positively perceived government communication (Germany). Female gender, higher age, belonging to a risk group, being affected physically and mentally, perception of governmental communication as guided by the interests of people, feeling of being well informed and the level of positive mental health positively predicted both outcomes, while being affected economically negatively predicted both outcomes. Country-specific results are considered in the light of the protection motivation theory and the theory of planned behavior together with potential ways to improve active participation of the population. Overall, we recommend the governments and authorities to stress that each individual can contribute to the control of the COVID-19 situation by adherence to the measures in the public communication. Moreover, they should emphasize the risk of unconscious infection of older individuals by younger people, as well as the importance of physical activity for the protection of mental and physical health especially during the pandemic.",2020,2020/12/07,PLOS ONE,15,12,e0243523,33284865.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0243523,,#758,Margraf 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Comparison of different response devices to assess behavioral tendencies towards chocolate in the approach-avoidance task,"Wittekind, C. E.; Blechert, J.; Schiebel, T.; Lender, A.; Kahveci, S.; Kuhn, S.","Behavioral tendencies in the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) have mostly been assessed using a joystick as a response device. In recent years, other hardware devices such as tablets, smartphones, and computer mice have also been used. However, it remains unclear whether different response devices yield similar results and show comparable psychometric properties. The aim of the present study was to assess approach biases towards chocolate with different response devices and to compare their reliability and validity. Forty-five individuals with regular chocolate consumption completed three different AATs (joystick, computer mouse, touchscreen), each comprised of two blocks. In the compatible block of trials, chocolate-related pictures had to be pulled near while object-related pictures had to be pushed away. In the incompatible block of trials, instructions were reversed. Preregistered analyses revealed that participants were faster to pull than to push chocolate-related pictures relative to object-related pictures, indicating an approach bias for chocolate with no significant differences between response devices. Correlations among the three response devices were low to medium. Exploratory analyses revealed that approach biases were moderated by block order such that biases were only present and associated with craving (joystick AAT only) when the incongruent block was completed first. Internal consistencies of the bias score ranged between r(SB) = 0.67-0.76. Results of the present study point to the existence of an approach bias to chocolate regardless of response device, albeit each task seems to measure a different aspect of it.

Continuity or compensation? - A hypothesis testing study concerning two types of dreamers' Aggressive Behaviors in Nightmares,"Mathes, J.; Pietrowsky, R.","Being the aggressor in dreams has been investigated relatively sparsely. On the one hand, these kinds of nightmares may represent continuity of aggression in waking-life, but on the other hand, being the aggressor in dreams may compensate failing (suppressed) aggression from waking-life. Two subtypes of aggressor nightmares should thus be distinguished: Those in which the dreamer is the primary aggressor and those, in which the dreamer reacts with aggression to a threatening event. We hypothesized that nightmares in which the aggressive event was caused by the dream-self may be related to waking-life aggression according to the continuity hypothesis, while in nightmares, in which the aggressive event by the dream-self was the response to threats caused by other dream-characters, the dream-self may be reacting in self-defense. Thus, participants who dreamt that the aggressive act was initiated by the dream-self should be more aggressive in waking-life (supporting continuity) than those who dreamt that the offending act was initiated by other dream characters, and the dream-self was only reacting (supporting compensation). Waking-life aggression was obtained with the Buss and Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Results showed that dreamers who dreamt that their dream-self initiated the aggressive act were more aggressive in waking-life than those who dreamt that other dream characters had initiated the aggressive act. Nightmares with aggression done by the dream-self thus support the continuity hypothesis of dreaming while aggressor nightmare with reactive aggression of the dream-self support the compensatory hypothesis of dreaming.",2022,May,Conscious Cogn,101,,103321,35413507.0,10.1016/j.concog.2022.103321,,#760,Mathes 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Belief revision and way-finding,"Bucher, L.; Roser, F.; Nejasmic, J.; Hamburger, K.","Belief revision is required when veridical information surfaces that contradicts what was previously thought to be the case. In way-finding, belief revision frequently occurs, for example, when the travelled route has led one astray, instead of to one's chosen destination. In past cognitive research, the topics of belief revision and way-finding have been treated in isolation. Here, we introduce an approach for linking the two fields and assess belief revision as it occurs in the process of way-finding. We report the results of two experiments that put participants in (virtual) situations where elements of a previously learned route description do not match the actual environment (thereby requiring the revision of a previously held belief). Experiment 1 puts participants in a highly artificial virtual environment where the landmarks to be used in navigation have a low degree of semantic salience (houses of various color). Experiment 2 puts subjects in a photorealistic environment where the objects to be used in navigation are well-known landmarks (such as the Eiffel Tower) and thus have a high degree of semantic salience. In both experiments, participants are confronted with T-junctions, where a landmark that was expected to indicate the correct route is discovered to be in an unexpected location. The results of the experiments show that a participant's choice of route, in such cases, is affected by differences in the structure of the relevant initial instruction. More precisely, the route chosen by participants is affected by whether the relevant landmark was described as being on the same side of the path as they were instructed to turn (congruent case) or as located on the opposite side of the path as they were instructed to turn (incongruent case).",2014,Feb,Cogn Process,15,1,99-106,24037389.0,10.1007/s10339-013-0577-x,,#761,Bucher 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Interpretation bias and contamination-based obsessive-compulsive symptoms influence emotional intensity related to disgust and fear,"Fink-Lamotte, J.; Widmann, A.; Fader, J.; Exner, C.","Biased processing of disgust-related stimuli is increasingly discussed in addition to fear-related processing as a maintenance factor for contamination-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (C-OCD). However, the differential impact of fear and disgust on biased processing in C-OCD is not yet completely understood. Because it is difficult to distinguish the two emotions in self-report assessment by directly addressing the specific emotions, a text paragraph-based interpretation bias paradigm was applied to more implicitly assess emotions. For the text-based interpretation bias paradigm, disgust-related, fear-related, disgust-fear-ambiguous and neutral text paragraphs describing everyday life situations were developed and validated in a pre-study (N = 205). Fifty-nine healthy participants watched either disgust- or fear-inducing movies and afterwards rated their experienced emotional response to the text paragraphs. The results show that fear and disgust components of an emotional response to mixed-emotional situations are strongly influenced by the situational context, and across the levels of trait contamination fear people did not differ in their fear experiences to everyday situations (which was overall strong), but in their disgust experiences.

fMRI-based decoding of reward effects in binocular rivalry,"Wilbertz, G.; van Kemenade, B. M.; Schmack, K.; Sterzer, P.","Binocular rivalry is a phenomenon where the simultaneous presentation of two different stimuli to the two eyes leads to alternating perception of the two stimuli. The temporary dominance of one stimulus over the other is influenced by several factors. Here, we studied the influence of reward on binocular rivalry dynamics and its neural representation in visual cortex. Orthogonal rotating grating stimuli were shown continuously, while monetary reward was given during the conscious perception of one stimulus but not the other. Periods of perceptual dominance were assessed both through participants' subjective report and objectively using functional magnetic resonance imaging and multi-voxel pattern analysis. Results did not confirm previous evidence for an effect of reward on perceptual dominance durations. Exploratory post-hoc analyses indicated that knowledge regarding both the reward contingency and the subjective nature of perceptual alternations may have interfered with potential reward effects on perceptual phase durations, suggesting a moderating role of meta-cognitive awareness in reward-based perceptual inference.

Impact of an acceptance facilitating intervention on psychotherapists' acceptance of blended therapy,"Baumeister, H.; Terhorst, Y.; Grassle, C.; Freudenstein, M.; Nubling, R.; Ebert, D. D.","Blended therapy is a new approach combining advantages of face-to-face psychotherapy and Internet- and mobile-based interventions. Acceptance is a fundamental precondition for its implementation. The aim of this study was to assess 1) the acceptance of psychotherapists towards blended therapy, 2) the effectiveness of an acceptance facilitating intervention (AFI) on psychotherapists' acceptance towards blended therapy and 3) to identify potential effect moderators. Psychotherapists (N = 284) were randomly assigned to a control (CG) or an intervention group (IG). The IG received a short video showing an example of blended therapy, the CG an attention placebo video. Both groups received a reliable online questionnaire assessing acceptance, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence and internet anxiety. Between group differences were examined using t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests. Exploratory analysis was conducted to identify moderators. Psychotherapists in CG showed mixed baseline acceptance towards blended therapy (low = 40%, moderate = 33%, high = 27%). IG showed significantly higher acceptance compared to CG (d = .27, pone-sided = .029; low = 24%, moderate = 47%, high = 30%). Bootstrapped confidence intervals were overlapping.

Gender Differences in Affective and Evaluative Responses to Experimentally Induced Body Checking of Positively and Negatively Valenced Body Parts,"Tanck, J. A.; Vocks, S.; Riesselmann, B.; Waldorf, M.","Body checking (BC) is defined as behavior aimed at gaining information on body shape, size, or weight. Besides its occurrence as a transdiagnostic symptom in eating disorders (EDs), BC is widespread in non-clinical populations. It is associated with body dissatisfaction and the development of body image disturbances and ED. Males and females differ in terms of body dissatisfaction and associated BC strategies. However, the question of a gender-related intensity of negative affect and state body satisfaction as reactions to BC remains open. Therefore, the present experimental study aimed to examine gender differences in affective and evaluative responses to BC. We tested n = 60 women and n = 60 men in a crossover design, implementing two experimental conditions and one control condition. In the negative body checking condition (NBC), participants received standardized instructions to check negatively valenced body parts. In the positive body checking condition (PBC), by contrast, participants were asked to check positively valenced body parts. The control condition (CBC) consisted of playing a computer game. Before and after checking of one's own body, participants rated negative body-related affect, i.e., guilt, shame, and disgust, and state body satisfaction. The results indicate that both NBC and PBC led to an increase in negative affect for men and women. Eating pathology predicted negative affect after checking in NBC for both genders. Men reported a significantly higher state body satisfaction in all conditions, whereas only women showed decreased body satisfaction in NBC. These findings suggest that BC of any body part (i.e., positively or negatively valenced) leads to increased negative affect for both genders. Eating pathology significantly influences the affective responses to BC for both genders. Changes in state body satisfaction, however, only occur in females. An explanation might be that men generally report higher body satisfaction, resulting in a more stable body image. Females and males with pathological eating behavior seem to be more vulnerable to changes in negative affect. As negative affect is equally increased after NBC and PBC for both genders, BC might play a central role in the maintenance of body image disturbances in males and females.",2019,2019/05/14,Front Psychol,10,,1058,31156502.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01058,,#767,Tanck 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Revisiting the Postulates of Etiological Models of Eating Disorders: Questioning Body Checking as a Longer-Term Maintaining Factor,"Opladen, V.; Vivell, M. B.; Vocks, S.; Hartmann, A. S.","Body checking (BC) is not only inherent to the maintenance of eating disorders but is also widespread among healthy females. According to etiological models, while BC serves as an affect-regulating behavior in the short term, in the longer term it is assumed to be disorder-maintaining and also produces more negative affect. The present study therefore aimed to empirically examine the proposed longer-term consequences of increased BC. In an online study, N = 167 women tracked their daily amount of BC over a total of 7 days: Following a 1-day baseline assessment of typical BC, participants were asked to check their bodies in an typical manner for 3 days and with a 3-fold increased frequency for 3-days. Before and after each BC episode, the impact of BC on affect, eating disorder symptoms, general pathology and endorsement of different functions of BC was assessed. Participants showed longer-term consequences of increased BC in terms of increased negative affect and general pathology, while eating disorder symptoms remained unaffected. In the case of typical BC, participants showed decreased general pathology and anxiety. Furthermore, the endorsement of a higher number of BC functions led to increased negative affect and an increased amount of typical BC. The findings support the theoretically assumed role of maladaptive BC in maintaining negative emotion in the longer term. However, though requiring replication, our finding of positive effects of typical BC calls into question the overall dysfunctionality of BC among non-clinical women who are not at risk of developing an eating disorder.",2021,2022/01/13,Front Psychiatry,12,,795189,35095608.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2021.795189,,#768,Opladen 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

"Body Dissatisfaction, Importance of Appearance, and Body Appreciation in Men and Women Over the Lifespan","Quittkat, H. L.; Hartmann, A.

Previous research on body image has focused mostly on women, largely neglecting body image in men. Moreover, only a small number of studies have conducted gender comparisons of body image over the lifespan and included participants aged 50 years and older. With regard to measurement, body image has often been assessed only in terms of body dissatisfaction, disregarding further aspects such as body appreciation or the importance of appearance. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore different aspects of body image in the general German-speaking population and to compare men and women of various ages. Participants completed an online survey comprising questionnaires about body image. Body dissatisfaction, importance of appearance, the number of hours per day participants would invest and the number of years they would sacrifice to achieve their ideal appearance, and body appreciation were assessed and analyzed with respect to gender and age differences. We hypothesized that body dissatisfaction and importance of appearance would be higher in women than in men, that body dissatisfaction would remain stable across age in women, and that importance of appearance would be lower in older women compared to younger women. Body appreciation was predicted to be higher in men than in women. General and generalized linear models were used to examine the impact of age and gender. In line with our hypotheses, body dissatisfaction was higher in women than in men and was unaffected by age in women, and importance of appearance was higher in women than in men. However, only in men did age predict a lower level of the importance of appearance. Compared to men, women stated that they would invest more hours of their lives to achieve their ideal appearance. For both genders, age was a predictor of the number of years participants would sacrifice to achieve their ideal appearance. Contrary to our assumption, body appreciation improved and was higher in women across all ages than in men.

Only a small number of studies have investigated structural differences in BPD patients regarding comorbid PTSD specifically and studies conducting additional surface analyses are scarce. We investigated structural differences in women with BPD with and without PTSD and non-patient controls. Automated voxel-based and region-based volumetric analyses were applied. Additionally, four surface-based measures were analyzed: cortical thickness, gyrification index, fractal dimension, and sulcus depth. Analyses did not identify cortical volume alterations in the fronto-limbic network. Instead, hypergyrification was detected in the right superior parietal cortex in BPD patients compared to non-patient controls. No distinction was revealed between BPD patients with and without PTSD. These findings underline the importance of a holistic investigation examining volumetric and surface measures as these might enhance the understanding of structural alterations in BPD.",2021,May 30,Psychiatry Res Neuroimaging,311,,111283,33812313.0,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2021.111283,,#773,Vatheuer 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on the cognitive control of negative stimuli in borderline personality disorder,"Schulze, L.; Grove, M.; Tamm, S.; Renneberg, B.; Roepke, S.","Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by impairments in the cognitive control of negative information. These impairments in cognitive control are presumably due to blunted activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) along with enhanced activations of the limbic system. However, the impact of an excitatory stimulation of the dlPFC still needs to be elucidated. In the present study, we therefore assigned 50 patients with BPD and 50 healthy controls to receive either anodal or sham stimulation of the right dlPFC in a double-blind, randomized, between-subjects design. Participants performed a delayed working memory task with a distracter period during which a grey background screen, or neutral, or negative stimuli were presented. This experimental paradigm was first evaluated in a pilot study with 18 patients with BPD and 19 healthy controls. In both studies, patients with BPD showed an impairment of cognitive control when negative distracters were presented in the delay period of a working memory task. However, excitatory stimulation of the right dlPFC did not ameliorate cognitive control of negative stimuli in BPD, which raises questions about the specific role of the right dlPFC for the understanding of BPD psychopathology.

Effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on empathy and approach motivation in women with borderline personality disorder: a randomized controlled trial,"Domes, G.; Ower, N.; von Dawans, B.; Spengler, F. B.; Dziobek, I.; Bohus, M.; Matthies, S.; Philipsen, A.; Heinrichs, M.","Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by severe interpersonal dysfunction with problems in social cognition, empathy and social approach. Although the neuropeptide oxytocin is known to regulate complex social cognition and behavior in healthy individuals and clinical populations, there is still a lack of evidence for a potential beneficial effect of oxytocin administration on social cognition and social approach in BPD. Fifty-one women with BPD and 51 matched healthy controls were randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject experimental trial. We administered a single dose of 24 IU oxytocin or placebo intranasally prior to a standardized task measuring affective and cognitive empathy and approach motivation. All participants were free of hormonal contraception and tested in the mid-luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. In the placebo condition, patients with BPD showed reduced cognitive and affective empathy, and less approach behavior motivation than healthy controls. Intranasal oxytocin significantly increased affective empathy and approach motivation in both BPD patients and healthy controls compared to placebo. More importantly, oxytocin administration led to similar scores between BPD and healthy controls. These findings provide the first evidence for a beneficial effect of oxytocin on deficits in affective empathy and approach motivation of BPD. Our results indicate a beneficial effect of a single dose of oxytocin on affective empathy and approach motivation in women with BPD adapting their level of social functioning to healthy controls.

Combining mental and physical stress: Synergy or interference?,"Finke, J. B.; Zhang, X.; Plein, D.; Schilling, T. M.; Schachinger, H.; Larra, M. F.","Both cognitive stressors (such as mental arithmetic tasks) and physical stressors (such as the cold pressor test, CP) are among the most widely employed tools in acute stress research, and there is growing evidence for a high degree of stimulus-response specificity, rather than uniformity, in the human stress response. However, little is known about potential synergistic or interfering effects during concurrent administration. While cognitive tasks have been hypothesized to attenuate pain perception during CP, they are also thought to enhance physiological reactivity. Conversely, physical stress might interfere with effective stress induction by cognitive challenges. To address these questions, 56 participants underwent either the CP (3-min ice-water immersion of feet) or a warm-water control condition. In half of the sample, the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) was performed simultaneously (fully crossed interventions). Salivary cortisol, cardiovascular parameters, and subjective ratings as well as voice pitch (F0) were assessed. Results show that cortisol responses, self-reported pain and subjective arousal were mainly driven by cold exposure, which also led to increased F0. The PASAT incrementally enhanced cardiovascular reactions, but did not affect pain ratings nor cortisol responses to the CP. However, intra-individual concordance between elevated blood pressure and other reactivity measures was enhanced by PASAT administration during the CP. Importantly, performance decrements in the mental-arithmetic task were not associated with diminished stress responses. In conclusion, our results speak against any strong interference when administering cognitive and painful physical stressors simultaneously, pointing rather to specific additive effects, particularly regarding cardiovascular reactivity.",2021,May 1,Physiol Behav,233,,113365,33600808.0,10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.113365,,#776,Finke 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Performance monitoring in obsessive-compulsive undergraduates: Effects of task difficulty,"Riesel, A.; Richter, A.; Kaufmann, C.; Kathmann, N.; Endrass, T.","Both obsessive-compulsive disorder and subclinical obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms seem to be associated with hyperactive error-related brain activity. The current study examined performance monitoring in subjects with subclinical OC symptoms using a new task with different levels of difficulty. Nineteen subjects with high and 18 subjects with low OC characteristics performed a random dot cinematogram (RDC) task with three levels of difficulty. The high and low OC groups did not differ in error-related negativity (ERN), correct-related negativity (CRN) and performance irrespective of task difficulty. The amplitude of the ERN decreased with increasing difficulty whereas the magnitude of CRN did not vary. ERN and CRN approached in size and topography with increasing difficulty, which suggests that errors and correct responses are processed more similarly. These results add to a growing number of studies that fail to replicate hyperactive performance monitoring in individuals with OC symptoms in task with higher difficulty or requiring learning. Together with these findings our results suggest that the relationship between OC symptoms and performance monitoring may be sensitive to type of task and task characteristics and cannot be observed in a RDC that differs from typically used tasks in difficulty and the amount of response-conflict.",2015,Aug,Brain Cogn,98,,35-42,26057081.0,10.1016/j.bandc.2015.05.002,,#777,Riesel 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Identifying potential training factors in a vibrotactile P300-BCI,"Eidel, M.; Kubler, A.","Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) often rely on visual stimulation and feedback. Potential end-users with impaired vision, however, cannot use these BCIs efficiently and require a non-visual alternative. Both auditory and tactile paradigms have been developed but are often not sufficiently fast or accurate. Thus, it is particularly relevant to investigate if and how users can train and improve performance. We report data from 29 healthy participants who trained with a 4-choice tactile P300-BCI during five sessions. To identify potential training factors, we pre-post assessed the robustness of the BCI performance against increased workload in a dual task condition and determined the participants' somatosensory sensitivity thresholds with a forced-choice intensity discrimination task. Accuracy (M = 79.2% to 92.0%) and tactually evoked P300 amplitudes increased significantly, confirming successful training. Pre-post somatosensory sensitivity increased, and workload decreased significantly, but results of the dual task condition remained inconclusive.

Week-long visuomotor coordination and relaxation trainings do not increase sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) based brain-computer interface performance,"Botrel, L.; Kubler, A.","Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) translate brain activity into control signals or commands for a device. Motor imagery of the limbs allows for modulating the sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), but there are up to 30% of the participants for whom electroencephalography (EEG) based SMR-BCI cannot detect any imagery-related changes. Individual variables, such as ability to concentrate on a task and error duration in a two-hand visuomotor coordination (VMC) task have been previously found to predict accuracy in an SMR-BCI. A first study attempted to substantiate those predictors by introducing a 30 min relaxation or VMC training period prior to an SMR-BCI session, but performance did not increase when compared to a control group. As the predictor training may have been too short, we applied 4 such training sessions on consecutive days in the current study. In a pre-post design, SMR-BCI accuracy of n = 39 participants increased from session 1 before to session 2 after the predictor training. While the manipulation of the predictor variables was successful, there was no effect on SMR-BCI performance. BCI accuracy correlated positively with the neurophysiological SMR predictor identified by Blankertz et al. [3], consolidating its predictive value, and with the state mindfulness scale.

Here, we investigated for the first time the hypothesis that this polymorphism in humans modulates the context dependency of conditioned fear responses. Applying a new paradigm examining generalization of cued fear across contexts, 70 participants stratified for BDNF Val66Met polymorphism were guided through two virtual offices (context) in which briefly illuminated blue and yellow lights served as cues. In the fear context, one light (conditioned stimulus, CS+) but not the other light (CS-) was associated with an electric shock (unconditioned stimulus, US). In the safety context, both lights were presented too, but no US was delivered. During the test phase, lights were presented again both in learning contexts and in a novel generalization context without any US. All participants showed clear fear conditioning to the CS+ in the fear context as indicated by potentiation of startle responses and reports of fear. No fear reactions were found for the CS+ in the safety context. Importantly, generalization of fear responses indicated by the potentiation of startle response to the CS+ compared with the CS- in the novel context was evident only in the Met-carrying group.

A total of 75 subjects were randomized to EEG-neurofeedback, mental imagery with a comparable treatment set-up or a waitlist group. At post-treatment, only EEG-neurofeedback led to a reduced frequency of binge eating (p = .015, g = 0.65). The effects remained stable to a 3-month follow-up. EEG-neurofeedback further showed particular beneficial effects on perceived stress and dietary self-efficacy. Differences in outcomes did not arise from divergent treatment expectations. Because EEG-neurofeedback showed a specific efficacy, it may be a promising brain-directed approach that should be tested as a treatment adjunct in clinical groups with binge eating.

[Bullying experiences in outpatients of a child and adolescent psychotherapy centre - A particularly vulnerable group?],"Kranhold, A. L.; Voigt, B.; Wolke, D.; Krause, K.; Friedrich, S.; Margraf, J.; Schneider, S.","Bullying experiences in outpatients of a child and adolescent psychotherapy centre - A particularly vulnerable group? Abstract. Objective: Bullying has both short- and long-term effects on physical and mental health. Thus, more victimized children might tend to be found in clinical samples. This is the first study to examine the prevalence of bullying roles and modes in children/adolescents in a psychotherapeutic outpatient setting in Germany. Method: 298 outpatients being treated in a child/adolescent psychotherapy centre (6-20 years, 50.7 % female) completed a questionnaire concerning their bullying experiences over the last 6 months. Results: 24.5 % of the patients reported from a victim's perspective, independent of being perpetrators of bullying. 19.1 % reported solely as victims, 5.4 % as victims who also bullied (bully-victims), and 2.0 % as bullies. More than one-third of those with victim or bully-victim experiences had been polyvictimized, 86.2 % were victims solely of traditional bullying, and 1.4 % solely of cyberbullying. The exploratory comparison to general-population school samples seems to show significantly more patients with victim experiences and significantly less patients who bullied others. There seem to be no significant effects for bully-victims. Compared to an inpatient sample, significantly fewer adolescent patients seem to state being victims or bully-victims.

"Bullying History and Mental Health In University Students: The Mediator Roles of Social Support, Personal Resilience, and Self-Efficacy","Lin, M.; Wolke, D.; Schneider, S.; Margraf, J.","Bullying victimization by peers is highly prevalent in childhood and adolescence. There is convincing evidence that victimization is associated with adverse mental health consequences. In contrast, it has been found that perpetrators suffer no adverse mental health consequences. These findings originate from Western countries such as Germany but have rarely been investigated in collectivistic societies such as China. Furthermore, it has been rarely studied whether positive intrapersonal characteristics (e.g., personal resilience and self-efficacy) and interpersonal positive resources (e.g., social support) may mediate the impact of bullying on mental health. The current study used a path analytic model to examine, firstly, whether previous bullying experiences (both victimization and perpetration) are associated with current positive and negative mental health in university students and, secondly, whether these influences are mediated by social support, resilience, and self-efficacy. The model was tested in 5,912 Chinese and 1,935 German university students. It was found that in both countries, higher victimization frequency was associated with lower levels of social support, personal resilience, and self-efficacy, which in turn predicted poorer mental health. Moreover, and only in China, perpetration was negatively associated with social support and personal resilience but not self-efficacy. In contrast, in the German sample, perpetration experience was found to enhance one's self-efficacy, and the later was associated with better mental health. The results support a mediation model in which social support, personal resilience, and self-efficacy partially mediate the influence of victimization on mental health in both countries. For the relationship between perpetration and mental health, self-efficacy was the only full mediator in Germany, whereas in China, both social support and personal resilience were partial mediators. In conclusion, peer victimization has adverse effects on mental health in both Germany and China. Only in China, however, is perpetration also associated with adverse mental health outcomes. In contrast, getting ahead by bullying in an individualistic society such as Germany is associated with increased self-efficacy and mental health. The differences found between an individualistic country and a collectivistic country have important implications for understanding and planning interventions to reduce bullying.",2019,2020/01/14,Front Psychiatry,10,,960,31993000.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00960,,#784,Lin 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Interpersonal stroking touch is targeted to C tactile afferent activation,"Croy, I.; Luong, A.; Triscoli, C.; Hofmann, E.; Olausson, H.; Sailer, U.","C tactile fibers are a specialized group of fibers innervating the non-glabrous skin that are tuned to light gentle stroking applied with velocities between 1 and 10 cm/s.

This was investigated in three studies. In study one, 45 participants (21.8 +/- 2.3 years, 24 women) were asked to stroke an artificial arm. In study two, 32 participants (28.3 +/- 8.7 years, 16 women) were asked to stroke their partner. In study three, 11 parents (29.4 +/- 5.7 years, 6 women) were asked to stroke their babies. Stroking velocity was tracked in all conditions.

There was a significant main effect of ISI, indicating that odors presented only 1 s apart are missed frequently. Uncued presentation facilitated detection at short ISIs, implying that changes of the olfactory environment are detected better than presentation of the same odor again.

However, little is known about the factors that shape the mental health of refugee youth living in refugee camps close to ongoing conflict. We conducted a cross-sectional study with a representative sample of 217 Burundian refugee children aged 7-15 and their mothers residing in refugee camps in Tanzania to investigate associations between risk, protective and promotive factors from various ecological levels (individual, microsystem, exosystem), and children's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, internalizing and externalizing problems, and prosocial behavior. Data were collected using structured clinical interviews and analyzed using multiple regression models. Exposure to violence across all contexts and engagement coping were risk factors for PTSD symptoms and internalizing problems, while only violence by mothers seemed to increase children's vulnerability for externalizing problems. A differential impact of violence exposures on prosocial behavior was observed. Higher-quality friendships appeared to protect youth from PTSD symptoms and externalizing problems, while they also promoted children's prosocial behavior, just as mothers' social support networks.

Children of Parents With a Mental Illness-Stigma Questionnaire: Development and Piloting,"Dobener, L. M.; Stracke, M.; Viehl, K.; Christiansen, H.","Children of parents with a mental illness are a particularly vulnerable group as they have a high risk to develop a mental disorder themselves and those are associated with high stigma. Moreover, just like primary recipients of stigma, they are affected by the social taboo surrounding mental illness: they do not receive enough information, are often left alone with their problems, and are thus considered ""invisible children"". In previous research, family stigma has only been assessed through general questionnaires for all family members. What has not yet been adequately investigated is how stigma difficulties affect the children of parents with mental illness in particular. To address these limitations, we developed the Children of Parents with Mental Illness-Stigma-Questionnaire (COPMI-SQ), a self-report instrument for young people aged 12-19 years, designed to assess young people's stigma experiences in daily life. Based on a systematic review preceding the questionnaire, we identified relevant stigma dimensions for children of parents with a mental illness that resulted in 93 items that according to theory were assumed to load on four different scales: experienced stigma, anticipated stigma, self-stigma, and structural discrimination. An expert discussion, and a comprehensibility analysis with the target group followed. In this paper, we report on the development process and initial pilot data (N = 32) on the psychometric properties of the COPMI-SQ. Item analyses via an item difficulty index, discriminatory power, as well as internal consistency analysis resulted in a revised instrument reduced to 67 items.

Neurophysiological markers of ADHD symptoms in typically-developing children,"Hilger, K.; Sassenhagen, J.; Kuhnhausen, J.; Reuter, M.; Schwarz, U.; Gawrilow, C.; Fiebach, C. J.","Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Neurophysiological correlates of ADHD include changes in the P3 component of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Motivated by recent advances towards a more dimensional understanding of ADHD, we investigate whether ADHD-related ERP markers relate to continuous variations in attention and executive functioning also in typically-developing children. ERPs were measured while 31 school children (9-11 years) completed an adapted version of the Continuous Performance Task that additionally to inhibitory processes also isolates effects of physical stimulus salience. Children with higher levels of parent-reported ADHD symptoms did not differ in task performance, but exhibited smaller P3 amplitudes related to stimulus salience. Furthermore, ADHD symptoms were associated with the variability of neural responses over time: Children with higher levels of ADHD symptoms demonstrated lower variability in inhibition- and salience-related P3 amplitudes. No effects were observed for ERP latencies and the salience-related N2. By demonstrating that ADHD-associated neurophysiological mechanisms of inhibition and salience processing covary with attention and executive functioning in a children community sample, our study provides neurophysiological support for dimensional models of ADHD. Also, temporal variability in event-related potentials is highlighted as additional indicator of ADHD requiring further investigation.",2020,Dec 31,Sci Rep,10,1,22460,33384437.0,10.1038/s41598-020-80562-0,,#796,Hilger 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Alcohol users were classified as dependent drinkers (using the DSM-IV criteria), binge drinkers (using criteria of the USA National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism) or low-risk drinkers (following recommendations of the Scientific board of trustees of the German Health Ministry).

Stressor-specific effects might result from divergent roles of both stress response systems. Social self-threat, linked to affiliation-oriented coping, might also influence sexual responsivity. To investigate stress-induced modulation of the processing of sexual cues and its relationship with cortisol, 58 participants underwent either a predominantly sympathetic stressor (3 min sustained handgrip) or similar control procedure. In both conditions, half of the sample was monitored by an opposite-sex person (social evaluation). Pupillary responses to erotic nudes were recorded and dissociated into fast and slow PCA components. Physically stressed participants showed enhanced (slow) dilation to explicit pictures.

However, little attention has been paid to the question of whether the frequently used experimental paradigms hold adequate psychometric properties. The present study examined the psychometric properties of three widely used cognitive bias tasks: the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT), the visual dot-probe-task, and the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Approach, attentional, and association biases towards valenced stimuli were repeatedly measured at five different time points in a sample of 79 healthy young adults. Two different devices were used for assessment: a personal computer (PC) and a touchscreen-based tablet. Reliability estimates included internal consistency and temporal stability. Validity was inferred from convergence across different behavioral tasks and correlations between bias scores and self-reported psychological traits. Reliability ranged widely amongst tasks, assessment devices, and measurement time points. While the dot-probe-task appeared to be completely unreliable, bias scores obtained from the PC-based version of the AAT and both (PC and touchscreen) versions of the IAT showed moderate reliability. Almost no associations were found across information processing tasks or between implicit and explicit measures.

Induction of a depression-like negativity bias by cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation,"Wolkenstein, L.; Zeiller, M.; Kanske, P.; Plewnia, C.","Cognitive control (CC) over emotional distraction is of particular importance for adaptive human behaviour and is associated with activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Deficient CC, e.g., presenting as negativity bias, has been suggested to underlie many of the core symptoms of major depression (MD) and is associated with impairments of dlPFC function. Correspondingly, enhancement of dlPFC activity with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can ameliorate these impairments in patients with MD. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a reduction of dlPFC activity by cathodal tDCS induces CC deficits, thus triggering a depression-like negativity bias in healthy subjects. Twenty-eight individuals participated in a double-blinded, balanced randomized crossover trial of cathodal (1 mA, 20 min) and sham tDCS applied to the left dlPFC. To assess CC we conducted a delayed response working memory (DWM) task and an arithmetic inhibition task (AIT) with pictures of varying valent content (negative, neutral, positive) during and immediately after stimulation. Cathodal tDCS led to impaired CC specifically over negative material as assessed by reduced response accuracy in the DWM and prolonged response latency in the AIT. Hence, the current study supports the notion that left dlPFC is critically involved in CC over negative material. Together with previously reported beneficial anodal effects, it indicates that the hypoactivation of left dlPFC causes deficits in CC over negative material, which is a possible aetiological mechanism of depression.",2014,Oct,Cortex,59,,103-12,25173954.0,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.07.011,,#810,Wolkenstein 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Cognitive control is quickly adapted to actual task requirements despite misleading context cues-Evidence from the N2, CRN, and ERN","Grutzmann, R.; Kathmann, N.; Heinzel, S.","Cognitive control is flexibly adapted to task requirements in healthy individuals. Medio-frontal negativities in the event-related potential of the electroencephalogram can serve as indicators of cognitive control. With increasing conflict frequency, stimulus-locked control, as indexed by the N2, is increased and response-locked control, as indexed by the correct-related negativity, is reduced. On the behavioral level, this shift is associated with improved conflict resolution as evident in reduced response times and error rates in incompatible trials and a reduced response time congruency effect. Cognitive control adaptation might be implemented through experience-based task sets specifying advantageous processing strategies. Here, we investigated whether the cognitive control task set will be sustained when coupled with a contextual cue, even when the initial task requirements are no longer present. A flanker task with two conflict frequency conditions (25% incompatible and 75% incompatible trials) was presented. In the training phase, the conflict frequency conditions were paired with a distinct context cue (i.e., background color). In the test phase, the previously associated cues were again presented, but conflict frequency was identical in both conditions (50% incompatible trials). Although typical cognitive control adaptation was observed in the training phase on the behavioral and event-related potentials level, this pattern was not sustained in the test phase. Thus, the present study provides further evidence that cognitive control is flexibly adapted to task requirements even in the presence of misleading cues.",2022,Feb,Psychophysiology,59,2,e13961,34713905.0,10.1111/psyp.13961,,#811,Grutzmann 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Context-specific adjustment of cognitive control: Transfer of adaptive control sets,"Surrey, C.; Dreisbach, G.; Fischer, R.","Cognitive control protects processing of relevant information from interference by irrelevant information. The level of this processing selectivity can be flexibly adjusted to different control demands (e.g., frequency of conflict) associated with a certain context, leading to the formation of specific context-control associations. In the present study we investigated the robustness and transferability of the acquired context-control demands to new situations. In three experiments, we used a version of the context-specific proportion congruence (CSPC) paradigm, in which each context (e.g., location) is associated with a specific conflict frequency, determining high and low control demands. In a learning phase, associations between context and control demands were established. In a subsequent transfer block, stimulus-response mappings, whole task sets, or context-control demands changed. Results showed an impressive robustness of context-control associations, as context-specific adjustments of control from the learning phase were virtually unaffected by new stimuli and tasks in the transfer block. Only a change of the context-control demand eliminated the context-specific adjustment of control. These findings suggest that context-control associations that have proven to be adaptive in the past are continuously applied despite major changes in the task structure as long as the context-control associations remain the same.",2017,Nov,Q J Exp Psychol (Hove),70,11,2386-2401,27696936.0,10.1080/17470218.2016.1239748,,#812,Surrey 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Cognitive emotion regulation withstands the stress test: An fMRI study on the effect of acute stress on distraction and reappraisal,"Sandner, M.; Zeier, P.; Lois, G.; Wessa, M.","Cognitive emotion regulation is a key mechanism for the maintenance of mental health, but may fail, when individuals are exposed to acute stress. To date, it is not well understood whether and to what extent acute stress effects contribute to impairments in emotion regulation capacities as the sparse existing studies have yielded heterogeneous results, indicating that stress timing might be a crucial factor. In the present study, 81 healthy participants underwent either an acute stress task (ScanSTRESS-C; n = 40) or a control condition (n = 41) while lying in the MRI scanner. In the subsequent Cognitive Emotion Regulation Task (CERT), participants were confronted with neutral or negative pictures and instructed to either view them, or regulate their upcoming emotions using either distraction or reappraisal. Subjective ratings of affective state as well as functional brain imaging data served to indicate emotion regulation. The results showed a successful stress manipulation as indicated by group differences in subjective wellbeing, saliva cortisol concentrations, heart rate, and functional brain activity in regions implicated in stress processing. With respect to emotion regulation, CERT data revealed a significant regulation effect at the neural and behavioral level (less negative emotional ratings after reappraisal and distraction trials compared to view trials) in both groups. However, no significant group differences were observed, neither in BOLD responses to the CERT, nor in behavioral ratings. Contrary to previous studies, our study did not reveal further evidence of stress-related effects on emotion regulation, potentially being related to differences between studies in experimental setting, timing, and procedures. This study therefore underlines the need of future studies that disentangle the complex interplay of stress and emotion regulation and identify different factors influencing their bidirectional relationship.",2021,Jul 16,Neuropsychologia,157,,107876,33930388.0,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2021.107876,,#813,Sandner 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Neural correlates of immediate and prolonged effects of cognitive reappraisal and distraction on emotional experience,"Hermann, A.; Kress, L.; Stark, R.","Cognitive emotion regulation strategies are important components of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Additionally, up-regulation and difficulties in the down-regulation of negative feelings are associated with mental disorders. However, little is known about the lasting effects of cognitive emotion regulation strategies on emotional experience and associated neural activation. Therefore, this study investigated immediate and prolonged effects of emotion regulation using cognitive reappraisal and distraction on subjective report and its neural correlates. Twenty-seven healthy females took part in a 2-day functional magnetic resonance imaging study. They were instructed to either up-regulate or down-regulate their negative feelings using a situation-focused cognitive reappraisal strategy, to distract themselves by imagining a specific neutral situation, or to passively look at repeatedly presented aversive and neutral pictures. Re-exposure to the same stimuli without a regulation instruction was conducted one day later. Self-reported negative feelings and blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses served as main outcome variables. As expected, the results show successful immediate up- or down-regulation of negative feelings by cognitive reappraisal and down-regulation of negative feelings by distraction. Furthermore, these changes in negative feelings were correlated with amygdala activation. A lasting effect on emotional experience associated with stronger ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation was found for down-regulation of negative feelings via cognitive reappraisal. Compared to distraction, down-regulation via cognitive reappraisal led to reduced negative feelings and stronger dorso- and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex responses one day later.

Valence of completed scenarios was rated by the participants, and scenario endings were coded by two independent raters on three dimensions, namely reference to sexual problems, sexual communication, and the use of sexually explicit language. Sexual function was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index and the International Index of Erectile Function. Multiple regression analyses were performed to assess whether the scenario-based task was associated with sexual function above and beyond other predictors (e.g., sexual distress). Individuals with lower sexual function rated the completed scenarios more negatively, and their endings included more references to problems related to low sexual function. In women with low sexual function, fewer endings included sexual communication with a partner or sexually explicit language. Our findings suggest that individuals with low sexual function appraise ambiguous sexual situations more negatively than other individuals.

M.; Heimlich, C.; Witthoft, M.; Weck, F.","Cognitive theories of hypochondriasis (HYP) suggest that catastrophic misinterpretations of benign body sensations are a core feature for the maintenance of the disorder. There is tentative support from an analog sample that the interpretation of illness-related information also involves an implicit affective component. This is the first study to examine this negative affective evaluation bias implicitly in patients with HYP. An adapted version of the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) with illness, symptom and neutral primes was used in 80 patients with HYP, and compared to 83 patients with an anxiety disorder (AD), as well as 90 healthy controls (CG). The HYP group showed significantly more negative affective reactions in illness prime trials, compared to both control groups, as well as more negative implicit evaluations on symptom prime trials, compared to the CG. Significant inverse relationships were observed only between the implicit evaluations of illness words and health anxiety questionnaires. Thus, an implicit negative affective evaluation bias of serious illnesses rather than symptoms is a unique feature of HYP.",2014,Oct,J Anxiety Disord,28,7,671-8,25124504.0,10.1016/j.janxdis.2014.07.004,,#820,Schreiber 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Seeing ""changes"" that aren't there: facial and object discrimination in body dysmorphic disorder","Buhlmann, U.; Rupf, L.; Gleiss, M. J.; Zschenderlein, K.; Kathmann, N.","Cognitive-behavioral models of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) suggest the disorder is characterized by several interpretive, attentional, and perceptual biases that contribute to its maintenance or even development. In addition, the role of aesthetic sensitivity has been discussed in BDD. However, previous research examining the ability to identify subtle changes in facial features and geometrical objects has produced mixed results. The purpose of the current study was to further evaluate facial and object discrimination among individuals with BDD (n=35), individuals with a dermatological condition (n=35), and mentally healthy control participants (n=35) using a facial and object discrimination paradigm assessing the sensitivity for changes in symmetry, color, and size. Overall, the groups did not differ with respect to their performance in detecting actual changes in facial or object images. However, there was a significant group difference when they were presented with a series of unchanged facial but not object images: the BDD group rated identical facial images significantly more often as being changed, relative to individuals without BDD.

"Prospective relations among internalization of beauty ideals, body image concerns, and body change behaviors: Considering thinness and muscularity","Hoffmann, S.; Warschburger, P.","Common models propose that the internalization of societal beauty ideals influences disordered eating behaviors and muscularity-oriented behaviors via body image concerns. However, previous studies addressing these pathways have been mainly cross-sectional and primarily included female samples. We investigated these pathways prospectively in male and female adolescents and young adults, examining two pathways: a 'weight/shape pathway,' linking thin-ideal internalization, weight/shape concern, and restrained eating, and a 'muscularity pathway,' linking athletic-ideal internalization, muscularity concern, and muscularity-oriented behavior. Across three time points, 973 participants from the German general population were assessed.

Costly avoidance of Pavlovian fear stimuli and the temporal dynamics of its decision process,"Boschet, J. M.; Scherbaum, S.; Pittig, A.","Conflicts between avoiding feared stimuli versus approaching them for competing rewards are essential for functional behavior and anxious psychopathology. Yet, little is known about the underlying decision process. We examined approach-avoidance decisions and their temporal dynamics when avoiding Pavlovian fear stimuli conflicted with gaining rewards. First, a formerly neutral stimulus (CS+) was repeatedly paired with an aversive stimulus (US) to establish Pavlovian fear. Another stimulus (CS-) was never paired with the US. A control group received neutral tones instead of aversive USs. Next, in each of 324 trials, participants chose between a CS-/low reward and a CS+/high reward option. For the latter, probability of CS+ presentation (Pavlovian fear information) and reward magnitude (reward information) varied. Computer mouse movements were tracked to capture the decision dynamics. Although no more USs occurred, pronounced and persistent costly avoidance of the Pavlovian fear CS+ was found. Time-continuous multiple regression of movement trajectories revealed a stronger and faster impact of Pavlovian fear compared to reward information during decision-making. The impact of fear information, but not reward information, modestly decreased across trials. These findings suggest a persistently stronger weighting of fear compared to reward information during approach-avoidance decisions, which may facilitate the development of pathological avoidance.",2022,Apr 21,Sci Rep,12,1,6576,35449167.0,10.1038/s41598-022-09931-1,,#825,Boschet 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

We examined data from a population-based sample with various sleep characteristics and the major part of sex hormones measured by mass spectrometry. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from 204 men and 213 women of the cross-sectional Study of Health in Pomerania-TREND. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Associations of total T (TT) and free T, androstenedione (ASD), estrone, estradiol (E2), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate, SHBG, and E2 to TT ratio with sleep measures (including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], Insomnia Severity Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were assessed by sex-specific multivariable regression models. RESULTS: In men, age-adjusted associations of TT (odds ratio 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.83), free T, and SHBG with AHI were rendered nonsignificant after multivariable adjustment. In multivariable analyses, ASD was associated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (beta-coefficient per SD increase in ASD: -0.71; 95% CI: -1.18 to -0.25). In women, multivariable analyses showed positive associations of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate with wake after sleep onset (beta-coefficient: .16; 95% CI 0.03-0.28) and of E2 and E2 to TT ratio with Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Additionally, free T and SHBG were associated with AHI in multivariable models among premenopausal women.

Cortisol in hair and the metabolic syndrome,"Stalder, T.; Kirschbaum, C.; Alexander, N.; Bornstein, S. R.; Gao, W.; Miller, R.; Stark, S.; Bosch, J. A.; Fischer, J. E.","CONTEXT: Although exposure to supraphysiological levels of glucocorticoids is known to contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), the importance of physiological variation in basal cortisol secretion is less clear. This issue can be addressed by using hair cortisol analysis, which for the first time allows the assessment of long-term integrated hormone levels. OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: We used the analysis of cortisol in hair (hairF) to examine associations of long-term cortisol levels with prevalence of MetS and individual cardiometabolic parameters in a large occupational cohort. In additional exploratory analyses, we also studied cardiometabolic associations with hair cortisone levels. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 1258 employees of a large aerospace company (aged 16-64 years; 84.8% males) who partook in a voluntary health assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The first 3 cm of scalp-near hair were analyzed for glucocorticoid concentrations using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Relevant cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed and MetS was diagnosed (according to 2009 international task force criteria). RESULTS: A higher prevalence of MetS was seen in individuals falling into the third (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.69) or fourth hairF quartile (odds ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.55-3.75) compared with the first quartile, in fully adjusted analyses. HairF also showed positive associations with weight-related anthropometric measures (body mass index, waist to hip ratio, waist circumference) and glycated hemoglobin.

Nevertheless, end-of-life discussions are often perceived as difficult and avoided. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate the Difficulties in End-of-Life Discussions - Family Inventory (DEOLD-FI) to allow a systematic assessment of reasons why people shy away from end-of-life discussions. METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer were recruited and completed the DEOLD-FI and measures of avoidance of cancer communication, quality of life and distress, and the experienced difficulty as well as the occurrence of end-of-life discussions. Standard item analyses and an exploratory factor analysis were conducted. Construct validity was analysed through associations between the DEOLD-FI and the aforementioned measures. RESULTS: Questionnaires were obtained from 112 participants (53% response rate; male 54%, mean age 64.9 years [range 33-94]). In the final 23-item version two factors were extracted: 'emotional burden due to end-of-life discussions' (alpha = 0.90) and ""negative attitudes towards end-of-life discussions"" (alpha = 0.91) explaining 69% of the variance (total scale alpha = 0.93). Construct validity was supported by its significant correlations with the reported difficulty in end-of-life discussions (r = 0.42) and avoidance of cancer communication (r = 0.40 to r = 0.46) and insignificant correlations with quality of life (r = -0.11), distress (r = 0.16), and physical well-being (r = 0.02).

Initial and sustained brain responses to contextual conditioned anxiety in humans,"Andreatta, M.; Glotzbach-Schoon, E.; Muhlberger, A.; Schulz, S. M.; Wiemer, J.; Pauli, P.","Contextual fear conditioning takes place if the occurrence of threat cannot be predicted by specific cues. As a consequence the context becomes the best predictor of the threat and later induces anxiety (sustained fear response). Previous studies suggest that both the amygdala and the hippocampus are crucial for contextual fear conditioning. First, we wanted to further elucidate the neuronal correlates of long-lasting contextual threat within a highly ecologically setting created in virtual reality (VR). Second, we wanted to distinguish between initial and sustained components of the anxiety response to a threatening situation. Twenty-four participants were guided through two virtual offices for 30s each. They received unpredictable electric stimuli (unconditioned stimulus, US) in one office (anxiety context, CXT+), but never in the second office (safety context, CXT-). Successful contextual fear conditioning was indexed by higher anxiety and enhanced US-expectancy ratings for CXT+ versus CXT-. Initial neural activity was assessed by modeling the onsets of both contexts, and sustained neural activity by considering the entire context duration (contrasts: CXT+ > CXT-). Amygdala and hippocampus revealed sustained activity. Initial and sustained activities were found in the middle temporal gyrus, and primary motor cortex (M1). Additional initial activity was obvious in orbitofrontal (OFC), dorsomedial (dmPFC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). These results suggest that entering a threatening context initially induces conditioned fear reactions (M1), recall of contingency awareness (dlPFC), and explicit threat appraisal (dmPFC, OFC). While remaining in the threatening context might involve anxiety-like conditioned responses (amygdala, M1) and the generation of a spatial map to predict where and when a threatening event may occur (hippocampus). We conclude that in humans initial versus sustained anxiety responses triggered by a threat associated context are associated with distinguishable brain activation patterns involving a fear network and a ""contingency-cognitive"" network, respectively.",2015,Feb,Cortex,63,,352-63,25460498.0,10.1016/j.cortex.2014.09.014,,#830,Andreatta 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Context-dependent generalization of conditioned responses to threat and safety signals,"Andreatta, M.; Genheimer, H.; Wieser, M. J.; Pauli, P.","Contextual information can modulate the conditioned response to a threat signal (conditioned stimulus, CS+): fear responses are either potentiated or attenuated depending on whether the context is threatening or safe. In this study, we investigated the influence of context on conditioned fear as well as on generalization of conditioned fear. Thirty-two participants underwent a cue-in-context learning protocol in virtual reality (VR). On Day 1 (acquisition), participants received a mild painful electric shock (unconditioned stimulus, US) in one virtual room (fear context, CTX+) at the offset of one colored light (CS+), but never at the offset of another colored light (CS-). In a second room (safety context, CTX-), the two lights were also presented, but not the US. Successful cue conditioning was indicated by aversive ratings and startle potentiation but not skin conductance responses (SCR) to CS+ versus CS- in CTX+ and not in CTX-. On Day 2 (generalization), participants re-visited both fear and safety contexts plus a generalization context (G-CTX), which was an equal mix of CTX+ and CTX-. The two CSs were shown again in all three contexts. Generalization of conditioned fear was revealed in affective ratings (CS+ was rated more aversive than CS- in G-CTX), but not in physiological measures (equal startle potentiation to CS+ versus CS- in all contexts). In sum, contextual information modulates the responses to a threat signal such that a safety context can inhibit conditioned fear.

Culturally Adapted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Plus Problem Management (CA-CBT+) With Afghan Refugees: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study,"Kananian, S.; Soltani, Y.; Hinton, D.; Stangier, U.","Culturally adapted cognitive behavioral therapy (CA-CBT) is a well-evaluated, transdiagnostic group intervention for refugees that uses psychoeducation, meditation, and stretching exercises. In the current study, we added problem-solving training to CA-CBT and evaluated this treatment (i.e., CA-CBT+) in a randomized controlled pilot trial with a sample of Farsi-speaking refugees. Participants (N = 24) were male refugees diagnosed with DSM-5 PTSD, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders who were randomly assigned to either a treatment or waitlist control (WLC) condition. Treatment components were adapted both to the specific cultural background and the current social problems of asylum seekers. Assessments were performed pretreatment, 12-weeks posttreatment, and 1-year follow-up. The primary treatment outcome was the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28); secondary outcome measures included the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, Patient Health Questionnaire, Somatic Symptom Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life, and Emotion Regulation Scale. Eleven of 12 participants were randomized to CA-CBT+ completed treatment. Based on intent-to-treat data, large between-group effect sizes were seen at posttreatment in the GHQ-28, d = 3.0, and for most secondary outcome measures. Improvements for individuals in the treatment group decreased at 1-year follow-up, but effect sizes demonstrated continued large improvements on all measures as compared to pretreatment levels. In summary, CA-CBT+ led to large improvements in general psychopathological distress and quality of life, which were maintained in the long term.

When numbers fail: do researchers agree on operationalization of published research?,"Haucke, M.; Hoekstra, R.; van Ravenzwaaij, D.","Current discussions on improving the reproducibility of science often revolve around statistical innovations. However, equally important for improving methodological rigour is a valid operationalization of phenomena. Operationalization is the process of translating theoretical constructs into measurable laboratory quantities. Thus, the validity of operationalization is central for the quality of empirical studies. But do differences in the validity of operationalization affect the way scientists evaluate scientific literature? To investigate this, we manipulated the strength of operationalization of three published studies and sent them to researchers via email. In the first task, researchers were presented with a summary of the Method and Result section from one of the studies and were asked to guess the hypothesis that was investigated via a multiple-choice questionnaire. In a second task, researchers were asked to rate the perceived quality of the study. Our results show that (1) researchers are better at inferring the underlying research question from empirical results if the operationalization is more valid, but (2) the different validity is only to some extent reflected in a judgement of the study's quality.

Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus Atrophy Predicts Pattern Separation Impairment in Patients with LGI1 Encephalitis,"Hanert, A.; Rave, J.; Granert, O.; Ziegler, M.; Pedersen, A.; Born, J.; Finke, C.; Bartsch, T.","Day-to-day life involves the perception of events that resemble one another. For the sufficient encoding and correct retrieval of similar information, the hippocampus provides two essential cognitive processes. Pattern separation refers to the differentiation of similar input information, whereas pattern completion reactivates memory representations based on noisy or degraded stimuli. It has been shown that pattern separation specifically relies on the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), whereas pattern completion is performed within CA3 networks. Lesions to these hippocampal networks emerging in the course of neurological disorders may thus affect both processes. In anti-leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis it has been shown in animal models and human imaging studies that hippocampal DG and CA3 are preferentially involved in the pathophysiology process. Thus, in order to elucidate the structure-function relationship and contribution of hippocampal subfields to pattern separation, we examined patients (n = 15, age range: 36-77 years) with the rare LGI1 encephalitis showing lesions to hippocampal subfields. Patients were tested 3.53 +/- 0.65 years after the acute phase of the disease. Structural sequelae were determined by hippocampal subfield volumetry for the DG, CA1, and CA2/3. Patients showed an overall memory deficit including a significant reduction in pattern separation performance (p = 0.016). In volumetry, we found a global hippocampal volume reduction. The deficits in pattern separation performance were best predicted by the DG (p = 0.029), whereas CA1 was highly predictive of recognition memory deficits (p < 0.001).

Transient hippocampal CA1 lesions in humans impair pattern separation performance,"Hanert, A.; Pedersen, A.; Bartsch, T.","Day-to-day life involves the perception of events that resemble one another. For the sufficient encoding and retrieval of similar information, the hippocampus provides two essential computational processes. Pattern separation refers to the differentiation of overlapping memory representations, whereas pattern completion reactivates memories based on noisy or degraded input. Evidence from human and rodent studies suggest that pattern separation specifically relies on neuronal ensemble activity in hippocampal subnetworks in the dentate gyrus and CA3. Although a role for CA1 in pattern separation has been shown in animal models, its contribution in the human hippocampus remains elusive. In order to elucidate the contribution of CA1 neurons to pattern separation, we examined 14 patients with an acute transient global amnesia (TGA), a rare self-limiting dysfunction of the hippocampal system showing specific lesions to CA1. Patients' pattern separation performance was tested during the acute amnestic phase and follow-up using an established mnemonic similarity test. Patients in the acute phase showed a profound deficit in pattern separation (p < .05) as well as recognition memory (p < .001) that recovered during follow-up. Specifically, patients tested in a later stage of the amnesia were less impaired in pattern separation than in recognition memory. Considering the time dependency of lesion-associated hippocampal deficits in early and late acute stages of the TGA, we showed that the pattern separation function recovered significantly earlier than recognition memory.

The current study aimed to extend previous findings by investigating both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between DPBs, motivational impairments and functioning in a sample of patients with psychotic disorders (N=58). We hypothesized, that DPBs would be related to functioning in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses and that this link would be mediated by motivational impairments. Data was assessed at baseline and post-treatment in a trial on the effects of cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis. At baseline, amotivation mediated the association between DPBs and functioning. From baseline to post-treatment, reduction of amotivation was associated with improvement of functioning significantly, whereas reduction of DPBs was unrelated to improvements in functioning or amotivation. The findings suggest that improvement in amotivation accounts for favorable treatment outcomes in regard to functioning but question the causal role of DPBs in negative symptoms and functioning.",2016,Oct 30,Psychiatry Res,244,,117-22,27479101.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2016.07.018,,#846,Pillny 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Social aversive generalization learning sharpens the tuning of visuocortical neurons to facial identity cues,"Stegmann, Y.; Ahrens, L.; Pauli, P.; Keil, A.; Wieser, M. J.","Defensive system activation promotes heightened perception of threat signals, and excessive attention to threat signals has been discussed as a contributory factor in the etiology of anxiety disorders. However, a mechanistic account of attentional modulation during fear-relevant processes, especially during fear generalization remains elusive. To test the hypothesis that social fear generalization prompts sharpened tuning in the visuocortical representation of social threat cues, 67 healthy participants underwent differential fear conditioning, followed by a generalization test in which participants viewed faces varying in similarity with the threat-associated face. We found that generalization of social threat sharpens visuocortical tuning of social threat cues, whereas ratings of fearfulness showed generalization, linearly decreasing with decreasing similarity to the threat-associated face. Moreover, individuals who reported greater anxiety in social situations also showed heightened sharpened tuning of visuocortical neurons to facial identity cues, indicating the behavioral relevance of visuocortical tuning during generalization learning.",2020,Jun 9,eLife,9,,,32515731.0,10.7554/eLife.55204,,#847,Stegmann 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Impaired regulation of emotion: neural correlates of reappraisal and distraction in bipolar disorder and unaffected relatives,"Kanske, P.; Schonfelder, S.; Forneck, J.; Wessa, M.","Deficient emotion regulation has been proposed as a crucial pathological mechanism in bipolar disorder (BD). We therefore investigated emotion regulation impairments in BD, the related neural underpinnings and their etiological relevance for the disorder. Twenty-two euthymic patients with bipolar-I disorder and 17 unaffected first-degree relatives of BD-I patients, as well as two groups of healthy gender-, age- and education-matched controls (N=22/17, respectively) were included. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while applying two different emotion regulation techniques, reappraisal and distraction, when presented with emotional images. BD patients and relatives showed impaired downregulation of amygdala activity during reappraisal, but not during distraction, when compared with controls. This deficit was correlated with the habitual use of reappraisal. The negative connectivity of amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) observed during reappraisal in controls was reversed in BD patients and relatives. There were no significant differences between BD patients and relatives. As being observed in BD patients and unaffected relatives, deficits in emotion regulation through reappraisal may represent heritable neurobiological abnormalities underlying BD. The neural mechanisms include impaired control of amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli and dysfunctional connectivity of the amygdala to regulatory control regions in the OFC. These are, thus, important aspects of the neurobiological basis of increased vulnerability for BD.",2015,Jan 20,Transl Psychiatry,5,1,e497,25603413.0,10.1038/tp.2014.137,,#849,Kanske 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

The aim of this study was to examine the long-term effects of emotion regulation on symptoms of depression. Moreover, we investigated which specific emotion regulation skills were associated with subsequent symptoms of depression. Participants were 116 individuals (78% women, average age 35.2 years) who registered for an online-based assessment of depression and its risk-factors and reported at least some symptoms of depression. Successful application of emotion regulation skills and depressive symptom severity were assessed twice over a 5-year period. We utilized cross-lagged panel analyses to assess whether successful skills application would be negatively associated with subsequent depressive symptom severity. Cross-lagged panel analyses identified successful skills application as a significant predictor for depressive symptom severity even when controlling for the effects of initial symptoms of depression. A comparison of the effect sizes for different emotion regulation skills on subsequent depressive symptoms suggests that most of the skills included have similar predictive value.

Evidence for altered amygdala activation in schizophrenia in an adaptive emotion recognition task,"Mier, D.; Lis, S.; Zygrodnik, K.; Sauer, C.; Ulferts, J.; Gallhofer, B.; Kirsch, P.","Deficits in social cognition seem to present an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia, and are known to be associated with an altered amygdala response to faces. However, current results are heterogeneous with respect to whether this altered amygdala response in schizophrenia is hypoactive or hyperactive in nature. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate emotion-specific amygdala activation in schizophrenia using a novel adaptive emotion recognition paradigm. Participants comprised 11 schizophrenia outpatients and 16 healthy controls who viewed face stimuli expressing emotions of anger, fear, happiness, and disgust, as well as neutral expressions. The adaptive emotion recognition approach allows the assessment of group differences in both emotion recognition performance and associated neuronal activity while also ensuring a comparable number of correctly recognized emotions between groups. Schizophrenia participants were slower and had a negative bias in emotion recognition. In addition, they showed reduced differential activation during recognition of emotional compared with neutral expressions. Correlation analyses revealed an association of a negative bias with amygdala activation for neutral facial expressions that was specific to the patient group. We replicated previous findings of affected emotion recognition in schizophrenia. Furthermore, we demonstrated that altered amygdala activation in the patient group was associated with the occurrence of a negative bias. These results provide further evidence for impaired social cognition in schizophrenia and point to a central role of the amygdala in negative misperceptions of facial stimuli in schizophrenia.",2014,Mar 30,Psychiatry Res,221,3,195-203,24434194.0,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2013.12.001,,#852,Mier 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Twelve adult patients with ADHD and 12 matched healthy controls were tested on a new task with several levels of anticipated delays during functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI). Behavioral measures of delay discounting, DAv, and delay frustration were collected. Skin conductance and finger pulse rate were assessed. Results indicated a group difference in response to changes in delay in the right amygdala: For control participants activity decreased with longer delays, whereas activity tended to increase for ADHD patients. The degree of amygdala increase was correlated with the degree of behavioral DAv within the ADHD group. Patients also exhibited increased emotional arousal on physiological measures.

Measuring change in depression-related interpretation bias: development and validation of a parallel ambiguous scenarios test,"Rohrbacher, H.; Reinecke, A.","Depressed mood is associated with making negatively biased interpretations of ambiguous everyday events. Experimental modification towards a more optimistic interpretation has become a focus of recent research. However, to date, no measures exist that have been tested with respect to their psychometric properties that justify repeated administration to capture change. We aimed to develop and evaluate a pragmatic assessment instrument, consisting of a 30-item questionnaire (long version) and two 15-item parallel short versions (A and B). Items were generated as ambiguous sentences, reflecting three relevant content areas based on Beck's cognitive triad. The sentences were rated for pleasantness, and this emotional appraisal task indicates the emotional valence of the interpretation. Due to the intention to develop a parallel test version, item-twins were generated. All three versions of the instrument were found to be structurally stable, internally consistent and valid. In line with Beck's cognitive triad in depression, confirmatory factor analyses determined a three-factor solution (i.e. self, experiences and future). Significant correlations were found between all scales and depressive mood. The two short versions represent the same underlying constructs, share identical psychometric properties and possess high parallel-test reliability. This study is the first to evaluate and confirm the factorial validity as well as the parallel-test reliability of an interpretation bias measure.

Machine learning (ML) approaches could eventually improve this discrimination using neuropsychological test data, but evidence is still missing. We therefore employed Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) and conventional Logistic Regression (LR) to retrospectively predict the diagnoses of 189 elderly patients (68 DEP and 121 DAT) based on either the well-established Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological assessment battery (CERAD-NAB) or a flexible battery approach (FLEXBAT). The best performing combination consisted of FLEXBAT and NB, correctly classifying 87.0% of patients as either DAT or DEP. However, all accuracies were similar across algorithms and test batteries (83.0% - 87.0%). Accordingly, our study is the first to show that common ML algorithms with their default parameters can accurately differentiate between patients clinically diagnosed with DAT or DEP using neuropsychological test data, but do not necessarily outperform conventional LR.",2022,Nov 1,Neuropsychol Dev Cogn B Aging Neuropsychol Cogn,,,1-28,36320158.0,10.1080/13825585.2022.2138255,,#855,Dominke 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

C.; Lehr, D.; Baumeister, H.; Cuijpers, P.; Ebert, D. D.","Depression is highly prevalent among university students. Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in addressing depressive symptoms, but it is open if this also applies to interventions directed at academic stress. It is also largely unclear if the techniques employed in such programs provide significant additional benefits when controlling for non-specific intervention effects. A sample of N = 200 students with elevated levels of depression (CES-D >/= 16) of a large distance-learning university were randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress intervention group (IG; n = 100) or an active control group (CG; n = 100) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program of equal length. Self-report data was assessed at baseline, post-treatment (7 weeks) and three-month follow-up. The primary outcome was depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk factors, and academic outcomes. We found significant between-group effects on depressive symptom severity (d = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.08-0.64), as well as behavioral activation (d = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.30-0.91), perceived stress (d = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18-0.73), anxiety (d = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.03-0.67) and other secondary outcomes post-treatment. Effects on depression were sustained at three-month follow-up. Response rates for depressive symptoms were significantly higher in the IG (26%) than the CG (14%) at post-test (chi (2)=4.5, p = 0.04), but not at three-month follow-up (p = 0.454). We also found significant effects on relevant academic outcomes, including work impairment (follow-up; d = 0.36), work output (post-treatment; d = 0.27) and work cutback (follow-up; d = 0.36).

Pre-post effect sizes range from g = 0.47 (disability) to g = 0.89 (depression). Changes in the use of cognitive restructuring, relaxation and to a lesser degree mental distraction were associated with changes in disability and depression. Effects from randomized trials can be translated to naturalistic settings.

Whole-brain analyses revealed that mothers compared to non-mothers more strongly activated areas including the left angular gyrus and the ventral prefrontal cortex but less strongly activated the right supramarginal gyrus and the dorsal prefrontal cortex. These differences were not specific to child stimuli but occurred in response to both adult and child stimuli and might indicate that mothers and non-mothers employ different strategies to infer action intentions from affective faces.

This is partially due to clinicians' concerns that patients may reject exposure or experience severe side effects, particularly in intensive forms of exposure. We examined acceptance and side effects of two randomly assigned variants of prediction error-based exposure treatment differing in temporal density (1 vs. 3 sessions/week) in 681 patients with panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, and multiple specific phobias. Treatment acceptance included treatment satisfaction and credibility, engagement (i.e., homework completion), and tolerability (i.e., side effects, dropout, and perceived treatment burden). Side effects were measured with the Inventory for the Balanced Assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy (INEP). We found treatment satisfaction, credibility, and engagement to be equally high in both variants of exposure-based treatment, despite higher treatment burden (beta = 0.25) and stronger side effects (beta = 0.15) in intensified treatment. 94.1% of patients reported positive effects in the INEP. 42.2% reported side effects, with treatment stigma (16.6%), low mood (14.8%) and the experience to depend on the therapist (10.9%) being the most frequently reported. The mean intensity of side effects was low. We conclude that prediction error-based exposure treatment is well accepted by patients with different anxiety disorders and that patients also tolerate temporally intensified treatment, despite higher perceived treatment burden and stronger side effects. Clinicians should be aware of the most frequent side effects to take appropriate countermeasures.

Goal-directed behavior under emotional distraction is preserved by enhanced task-specific activation,"Wessa, M.; Heissler, J.; Schonfelder, S.; Kanske, P.","Despite the distracting effects of emotional stimuli on concurrent task performance, humans are able to uphold goal-directed behavior. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that this effect is due to the enhanced recruitment of task-specific neural resources. In a two-step functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we first localized those areas involved in mental arithmetics by contrasting arithmetic problems with a number detection task. The resulting activation maps were then used as masks in a second experiment that compared the effects of neutral and emotional distracter images on mental arithmetics. We found increased response times in the emotional distracter condition, accompanied by enhanced activation in task-specific areas, including superior parietal cortex, dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. This activation increase correlated with larger behavioral impairment through emotional distraction. Similar error rates in both conditions indicate that cognitive task performance is preserved through enhanced recruitment of task-specific neural resources when emotional distracter stimuli are present.",2013,Mar,Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci,8,3,305-12,22302842.0,10.1093/scan/nsr098,,#867,Wessa 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Lessons learned from an attempted randomized-controlled feasibility trial on ""WIDeCAD"" - An internet-based depression treatment for people living with coronary artery disease (CAD)","Bendig, E.; Bauereiss, N.; Buntrock, C.; Habibovic, M.; Ebert, D. D.; Baumeister, H.","Despite the high prevalence of comorbid depression in people living with coronary artery disease (CAD), uptake of psychological treatment is generally low. This study was designed to investigate the feasibility of an internet-based cognitive-behavioral (iCBT) depression intervention for people with CAD and depressive symptoms. METHODS: People with CAD and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 >/= 5) were randomly assigned to the eight modules comprising iCBT (N = 18), or waitlist-control (N = 16). Measures were taken at baseline (t1) and at post-treatment (eight weeks after randomization, t2). Feasibility-related outcomes were recruitment strategy, study attrition, intervention dropout, satisfaction, negative effects as well as the potential of the intervention to affect likely outcomes in a future full-scale trial (depression, anxiety, quality of life, fear of progression). Data analyses were based on intention-to-treat principles. Linear regression models were used to detect between group differences. Linear Mixed Models were used to model potential changes over time. RESULTS: This trial was terminated prior to a-priori defined sample size has been reached given low recruitment success as well as high intervention dropout (88%) and study attrition (23%). On average, participants in the intervention group completed M = 2.78 (SD = 3.23) modules. Participants in the waitlist control group barely started one module (M = 0.82, SD = 1.81). The satisfaction with the intervention was low (M = 20.6, SD = 0.88). Participants reported no negative effects attributed to the iCBT. Differences between groups with regard to depression, anxiety, fear of progression and quality of life remained non-significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This trial failed to recruit a sufficient number of participants. Future work should explore potential pitfalls with regards to the reach and persuasiveness of internet interventions for people living with CAD. The study gives important indications for future studies with regard to the need for new ideas to reach and treat people with CAD and depression.",2021,Apr,Internet Interv,24,,100375,33732627.0,10.1016/j.invent.2021.100375,,#868,Bendig 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Monitor yourself! Deficient error-related brain activity predicts real-life self-control failures,"Kronke, K. M.; Wolff, M.; Mohr, H.; Kraplin, A.; Smolka, M. N.; Buhringer, G.; Goschke, T.","Despite their immense relevance, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying real-life self-control failures (SCFs) are insufficiently understood. Whereas previous studies have shown that SCFs were associated with decreased activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG; a region involved in cognitive control), here we consider the possibility that the reduced implementation of cognitive control in individuals with low self-control may be due to impaired performance monitoring. Following a brain-as-predictor approach, we combined experience sampling of daily SCFs with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a Stroop task. In our sample of 118 participants, proneness to SCF was reliably predicted by low error-related activation of a performance-monitoring network (comprising anterior mid-cingulate cortex, presupplementary motor area, and anterior insula), low posterror rIFG activation, and reduced posterror slowing. Remarkably, these neural and behavioral measures predicted variability in SCFs beyond what was predicted by self-reported trait self-control. These results suggest that real-life SCFs may result from deficient performance monitoring, leading to reduced recruitment of cognitive control after responses that conflict with superordinate goals.",2018,Aug,Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci,18,4,622-637,29654477.0,10.3758/s13415-018-0593-5,,#869,Kronke 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Identifying predictive features of autism spectrum disorders in a clinical sample of adolescents and adults using machine learning,"Kupper, C.; Stroth, S.; Wolff, N.; Hauck, F.; Kliewer, N.; Schad-Hansjosten, T.; Kamp-Becker, I.; Poustka, L.; Roessner, V.; Schultebraucks, K.; Roepke, S.","Diagnosing autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a complicated, time-consuming process which is particularly challenging in older individuals. One of the most widely used behavioral diagnostic tools is the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Previous work using machine learning techniques suggested that ASD detection in children can be achieved with substantially fewer items than the original ADOS. Here, we expand on this work with a specific focus on adolescents and adults as assessed with the ADOS Module 4. We used a machine learning algorithm (support vector machine) to examine whether ASD detection can be improved by identifying a subset of behavioral features from the ADOS Module 4 in a routine clinical sample of N = 673 high-functioning adolescents and adults with ASD (n = 385) and individuals with suspected ASD but other best-estimate or no psychiatric diagnoses (n = 288). We identified reduced subsets of 5 behavioral features for the whole sample as well as age subgroups (adolescents vs. adults) that showed good specificity and sensitivity and reached performance close to that of the existing ADOS algorithm and the full ADOS, with no significant differences in overall performance.

Screening tools can aid clinicians within the initial step of the diagnostic process. For the first time, the Children׳s Depression Screener (ChilD-S) is validated in a mental health setting as a novel field of application beyond the previously examined pediatric setting. Based on a structured interview, DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of depression were made for 79 psychiatric patients aged 9-12, serving as the gold standard for validation. For assessing criterion validity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. Point prevalence of major depression and dysthymia was 28%. Diagnostic accuracy in terms of the area under the ROC curve was high (0.97). At the optimal cut-off point >/=12 according to the Youden׳s index, sensitivity was 0.91 and specificity was 0.81. The findings suggest that the ChilD-S is not only a valid screening instrument for childhood depression in pediatric care but also in mental health settings.

Cognitive functioning and emotion processing in breast cancer survivors and controls: An ERP pilot study,"Wirkner, J.; Weymar, M.; Low, A.; Hamm, C.; Struck, A. M.; Kirschbaum, C.; Hamm, A. O.","Diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is a very emotionally aversive and stressful life event, which can lead to impaired cognitive functioning and mental health. Breast cancer survivors responding with repressive emotion regulation strategies often show less adaptive coping and adverse outcomes. We investigated cognitive functioning and neural correlates of emotion processing using ERPs. Self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as hair cortisol as an index of chronic stress, were assessed. Twenty breast cancer survivors (BCS) and 31 carefully matched healthy controls participated in the study. After neuropsychological testing and subjective assessments, participants viewed 30 neutral, 30 unpleasant, and 30 pleasant pictures, and ERPs were recorded. Recognition memory was tested 1 week later. BCS reported stronger complaints about cognitive impairments and more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Moreover, they showed elevated hair cortisol levels. Except for verbal memory, cognitive functioning was predominantly in the normative range. Recognition memory performance was decreased in cancer survivors, especially for emotional contents. In ERPs, survivors showed smaller late positive potential amplitudes for unpleasant pictures relative to controls in a later time window, which may indicate less elaborative processing of this material. Taken together, we found cognitive impairments in BCS in verbal memory, impaired emotional picture memory accuracy, and reduced neural activity when breast cancer survivors were confronted with unpleasant materials. Further studies and larger sample sizes, however, are needed to evaluate the relationship between altered emotion processing and reduced memory in BCS in order to develop new treatment strategies.",2017,Aug,Psychophysiology,54,8,1209-1222,28432781.0,10.1111/psyp.12874,,#872,Wirkner 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Multi-level modeling revealed that while BPD patients and healthy controls mind-wander to a similar extent, BPD patients' thoughts are colored predominantly negatively. Most importantly, although their thoughts concerned the self and others as much as in controls, they fluctuated more strongly in the degree to which their thoughts concerned themselves and others and also gave more extreme ratings. Self- and other related thoughts that were more extreme were also more negative in valence.

Linking Personality Traits to Individual Differences in Affective Spaces,"Levine, S. M.; Alahaivala, A. L. I.; Wechsler, T. F.; Wackerle, A.; Rupprecht, R.; Schwarzbach, J. V.","Different individuals respond differently to emotional stimuli in their environment. Therefore, to understand how emotions are represented mentally will ultimately require investigations into individual-level information. Here we tasked participants with freely arranging emotionally charged images on a computer screen according to their subjective emotional similarity (yielding a unique affective space for each participant) and subsequently sought external validity of the layout of the individuals' affective spaces through the five-factor personality model (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) assessed via the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Applying agglomerative hierarchical clustering to the group-level affective space revealed a set of underlying affective clusters whose within-cluster dissimilarity, per individual, was then correlated with individuals' personality scores. These cluster-based analyses predominantly revealed that the dispersion of the negative cluster showed a positive relationship with Neuroticism and a negative relationship with Conscientiousness, a finding that would be predicted by prior work. Such results demonstrate the non-spurious structure of individualized emotion information revealed by data-driven analyses of a behavioral task (and validated by incorporating psychological measures of personality) and corroborate prior knowledge of the interaction between affect and personality. Future investigations can similarly combine hypothesis- and data-driven methods to extend such findings, potentially yielding new perspectives on underlying cognitive processes, disease susceptibility, or even diagnostic/prognostic markers for mental disorders involving emotion dysregulation.",2020,2020/03/12,Front Psychol,11,,448,32231631.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00448,,#874,Levine 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Reward Processing in Unipolar and Bipolar Depression: A Functional MRI Study,"Redlich, R.; Dohm, K.; Grotegerd, D.; Opel, N.; Zwitserlood, P.; Heindel, W.; Arolt, V.; Kugel, H.; Dannlowski, U.","Differentiating bipolar disorders (BD) from unipolar depression (UD) remains a major clinical challenge. The identification of neurobiological markers may help to differentiate these disorders, particularly during depressive episodes. This cross-sectional study, including 33 patients with UD, 33 patients with BD, and 34 healthy controls, is one of the first to directly compare UD and BD with respect to reward processing. A card-guessing paradigm was employed and brain activity associated with reward processing was investigated by means of fMRI. A 3 (group) x 2 (condition: reward>control, loss>control) ANOVA was conducted using the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) as ROI. Furthermore, a whole-brain approach was applied. A functional connectivity analysis was performed to characterize diagnosis-related alterations in the functional coupling between the NAcc and other brain areas. The ANOVA revealed higher activity for healthy controls (HCs) than for BD and UD in the NAcc during reward processing. Moreover, UD showed a higher functional connectivity between the NAcc and the VTA than HC. The patients groups could be differentiated in that BD showed a decreased activation, in the reward condition, of the NAcc, caudate nucleus, thalamus, putamen, insula, and prefrontal areas compared with UD. These results may help to refine the understanding of neural correlates of reward processing in both disorders, and to understand the neural underpinnings of anhedonia, a core symptom of depressive episodes.",2015,Oct,Neuropsychopharmacology,40,11,2623-31,25881114.0,10.1038/npp.2015.110,,#875,Redlich 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Methods: In an online-survey, 101 therapists described difficult situations and their corresponding reactions. The reports were analyzed by qualitative content analysis (Mayring 2015) and resulted in two category systems for the difficult situations and the reactions. Results: Difficult situations reached from everyday conflicts to extreme situations (e. g. threats). The most frequent difficult situations were in context of therapeutic frame, aspects of disorder, and critics, demands, accusations of patients. The most frequent reactions concerned therapeutic frame, external help and supportive interventions.

Do People With Psychosis Have Specific Difficulties Regulating Emotions?,"Lincoln, T. M.; Hartmann, M.; Kother, U.; Moritz, S.","Difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) are present in psychotic disorders, but their precise nature is not yet fully understood and it is unclear which difficulties are unique to psychosis compared with other disorders. This study investigated whether ER difficulties in psychosis are more prominent for the ability to modify emotions or for the ability to tolerate and accept them. Furthermore, it investigated whether ER difficulties occur for sadness, anxiety, anger and shame likewise. ER skills were assessed in participants with psychotic disorders (n = 37), participants with depression (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 28) using the Emotion Regulation Skill Questionnaire that asks participants to rate the intensity of different emotions over the past week and the skills employed to handle each of them. Compared with healthy controls, participants with psychosis showed reduced skills related to awareness, understanding and acceptance of potentially distressing emotions, but not in the ability to modify them. These differences remained significant after controlling for depression. Participants with psychosis showed reduced ER skills in regard to all of the assessed emotions compared with the healthy controls, despite the fact that they only reported sadness as being significantly more intense. The participants with depression showed a similar pattern of ER skills to the psychosis sample, although with a tendency towards even more pronounced difficulties. It is concluded that psychosis is characterized by difficulties in using specific ER skills related to awareness, understanding and acceptance to regulate anger, shame, anxiety and sadness. These difficulties are not unique to psychosis but nevertheless present a promising treatment target. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: The participants with psychosis found it more difficult to be aware of their emotions, to understand them and to accept them than the healthy control group. However, they reported equal skills when it came to actively modifying emotions. The difficulties in emotion regulation reported by the participants with psychosis were comparable with those reported by the participants with depression, and they occurred for all types of negative emotions likewise. The difficulties in using specific ER skills related to awareness, understanding and acceptance are a promising target for psychological treatment of psychosis. Interventions that are aimed specifically at increasing these skills need to be further developed.",2015,Nov-Dec,Clin Psychol Psychother,22,6,637-46,25256563.0,10.1002/cpp.1923,,#877,Lincoln 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Out of control? Acting out anger is associated with deficient prefrontal emotional action control in male patients with borderline personality disorder,"Bertsch, K.; Krauch, M.; Roelofs, K.; Cackowski, S.; Herpertz, S. C.; Volman, I.","Difficulty in anger control and anger-related aggressive outbursts against others are frequently reported by patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although male sex is a known predictor for aggression, hardly any study has addressed the neural correlates of deficient anger control in male patients with BPD. Building on previous reports in female BPD, we investigated the involvement of lateral antero- and dorsal prefrontal cortex in the control of fast emotional actions and its relation to self-reported tendencies to act out anger. 15 medication-free male patients with BPD and 25 age- and intelligence-matched healthy men took part in a social Approach-Avoidance task in the MR-scanner. This task allows the measurement of neural correlates underlying the control of fast behavioral tendencies to approach happy and avoid angry faces. Hypothesis-driven region-of-interest and exploratory whole brain analyses were used to test for activations of antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal regions and their relation with the amygdala during emotional action control as well as their association with self-reported anger out in male patients with BPD and healthy volunteers. Male patients with BPD showed reduced anterolateral prefrontal activations during emotional action control compared to healthy volunteers. Furthermore, anger out was negatively related to antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal activations, while it was positively related to amygdala activity in male patients with BPD. The current results suggest the involvement of antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal regions in controlling and overriding fast emotional actions.

Ratings of evoked disgust as well as responses of the autonomic nervous system (heart rate, skin conductance level, systolic blood pressure) were recorded and the effect of stimulus labeling and of repeated presentation was analyzed. Ratings suggested that disgust could be evoked through all senses; they were highest for visual stimuli. However, autonomic reaction toward disgusting stimuli differed according to the channel of presentation. In contrast to the other, olfactory disgust stimuli provoked a strong decrease of systolic blood pressure. Additionally, labeling enhanced disgust ratings and autonomic reaction for olfactory and tactile, but not for visual and auditory stimuli.

"Dissociation of neuronal, electrodermal, and evaluative responses in disgust extinction","Klucken, T.; Schweckendiek, J.; Merz, C. J.; Vaitl, D.; Stark, R.","Disgust extinction is an important mechanism relevant for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, only a few studies have investigated disgust extinction. Moreover, because disgust sensitivity (DS) is considered as a relevant factor for learning processes, this study also investigated the potential relationship between DS and disgust extinction learning. The aim of this study was to explore the neuronal correlates of disgust extinction, as well as changes in skin conductance responses (SCRs) and evaluative conditioning. Twenty subjects were exposed to a differential extinction paradigm, in which a previous conditioned, and now unreinforced, stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was compared to a second stimulus (CS-), which was previously not associated with the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Extinction learning was measured on three different response levels (BOLD responses, SCRs, and evaluative conditioning). Regarding evaluative conditioning, the CS+ was rated as more unpleasant than the CS-. Interestingly, significantly increased amygdala responses and SCRs toward to the CS- were observed. Finally, a (negative) trend was found between DS scores and BOLD responses of the prefrontal cortex. The present findings showed a dissociation of different response levels. The increased CS- responses could be explained by the assumption that the increased amygdala activity may reflect a safety learning signal during the first extinction trials and the subjective focus may therefore shift from the CS+ to the CS-. The correlation finding supports previous studies postulating that DS hampers extinction processes. The present results point toward dissociations between the response levels in context of extinction processes.",2013,Jun,Behav Neurosci,127,3,380-6,23731074.0,10.1037/a0032331,,#880,Klucken 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Furthermore, heart rate activity and facial muscle activity on the fear-specific m. corrugator supercilli and the disgust-specific m. levator labii were assessed. The results partially support the temporal urgency hypothesis of disgust. The emotion conditions significantly differed in emotional engagement and in the facial muscle activity of the m. levator labii as expected. However, contrary to our expectations, no differences between the emotion conditions regarding behavioral inhibition as well as heart rate change could be found. Furthermore, individuals with a higher-trait disgust proneness showed faster reactions and higher activity of the m. levator labii in response to disgust stimuli.

We link these findings by examining learning through positive and negative feedback in patients with aMCI, and explore its anatomic underpinnings with diffusion tensor imaging and tractography. Compared to healthy controls, patients with single-domain aMCI were impaired in learning from positive feedback, while learning from negative outcomes was preserved. Among pathways within the brain circuit involved in feedback learning, abnormal white matter microstructure was observed in tracts, which connect left-hemispheric amygdala with hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In all participants, reduced white matter integrity in this left fiber tract was specifically associated with learning from positive outcomes. Microstructure of right-hemispheric tracts between amygdala and entorhinal cortex was related to learning from negative feedback, and was not compromised in aMCI patients.

The role of auditory transient and deviance processing in distraction of task performance: a combined behavioral and event-related brain potential study,"Berti, S.","Distraction of goal-oriented performance by a sudden change in the auditory environment is an everyday life experience. Different types of changes can be distracting, including a sudden onset of a transient sound and a slight deviation of otherwise regular auditory background stimulation. With regard to deviance detection, it is assumed that slight changes in a continuous sequence of auditory stimuli are detected by a predictive coding mechanisms and it has been demonstrated that this mechanism is capable of distracting ongoing task performance. In contrast, it is open whether transient detection-which does not rely on predictive coding mechanisms-can trigger behavioral distraction, too. In the present study, the effect of rare auditory changes on visual task performance is tested in an auditory-visual cross-modal distraction paradigm. The rare changes are either embedded within a continuous standard stimulation (triggering deviance detection) or are presented within an otherwise silent situation (triggering transient detection). In the event-related brain potentials, deviants elicited the mismatch negativity (MMN) while transients elicited an enhanced N1 component, mirroring pre-attentive change detection in both conditions but on the basis of different neuro-cognitive processes. These sensory components are followed by attention related ERP components including the P3a and the reorienting negativity (RON). This demonstrates that both types of changes trigger switches of attention. Finally, distraction of task performance is observable, too, but the impact of deviants is higher compared to transients. These findings suggest different routes of distraction allowing for the automatic processing of a wide range of potentially relevant changes in the environment as a pre-requisite for adaptive behavior.",2013,,Front Hum Neurosci,7,,352,23874278.0,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00352,,#884,Berti 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Clarifying the latent structure and correlates of somatic symptom distress: A bifactor model approach,"Witthoft, M.; Fischer, S.; Jasper, F.; Rist, F.; Nater, U.

To clarify the structure of somatic symptom distress and to explore associations to health anxiety, somatosensory amplification, and functional somatic syndromes, data sets of 2 samples of college students from Germany (N = 1,520) and Switzerland (N = 3,053) were investigated with confirmatory factor analysis with robust estimation. A bifactor model (with 1 general and 4 orthogonal specific symptom factors-gastrointestinal, fatigue, cardio-pulmonary, and pain symptoms) revealed the best model fit. Medium-sized associations were found among latent factors of general somatic symptom distress, health anxiety, and depression. First evidence for the construct validity of the latent variables within the proposed bifactor structure was gained by observing (a) strong associations between the general somatic symptom distress factor and somatosensory amplification and (b) significant associations between both the general somatic symptom factor as well as the symptom-specific factors with functional somatic syndromes. The results offer a theoretically and psychometrically plausible model for the structure of somatic symptom distress and suggest a distinction between cognitive-affective and sensory aspects of symptom perception. The findings are compatible with current cognitive psychological and neuropsychological approaches to symptom perception and imply that somatic symptom distress is a multidimensional phenomenon that is both strongly linked to but also clearly separable from related constructs.",2016,Jan,Psychol Assess,28,1,109-15,26029944.0,10.1037/pas0000150,,#885,Witthoft 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
[Accessing Disturbances of Attachment Symptoms Using Interview Technique],"Kliewer-Neumann, J.; Bovenschen, I.; Lang, K.; Spangler, G.; Nowacki, K.; Roland, I. C.","Disturbances of attachment represent a clinically significant disorder and seriously impair social behavioural functioning. To date there has been little research and valid diagnostic methods are lacking. In the present study a German Version of the Disturbances of Attachment Interview developed by Smyke and Zeanah (1999) was used to assess disturbances of attachment in a sample of foster children and the validity of the translation is investigated. Furthermore, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997) was used to examine the discriminative validity. The results show a satisfying reliability and the scales of attachment disorders declare the main of the variance. There is a weak association between the disinhibited scale and hyperactivity in the SDQ. Overall the disinhibited disorder can be distinguished from other behaviour patterns. Regarding the inhibited scale there are associations with all SDQ scales and the inhibited category seems harder to distinguish from other deviant developmental issues. The method is evaluated as a qualified approach to the diagnosis of attachment disorders in the context of a multimethodical approach.

They were exposed to a ""traumatic"" film clip (trauma-film-paradigm). For one group of participants a friendly dog was present during the film, one group of participants was accompanied by a friendly human, another control group watched the film with a toy animal and the last group watched the film clip alone. Participants that were accompanied by the dog during the film reported lower anxiety ratings and less negative affect after the film clip as compared to the ""toy dog group"" and the ""alone group."" Results of the ""dog group"" were comparable to the group that was accompanied by a friendly human. There were no differences in physiological stress responses between the four conditions.

The dopamine D2 receptor mediates approach-avoidance tendencies in smokers,"Zlomuzica, A.; Machulska, A.; Roberts, S.; von Glischinski, M.; Rinck, M.; Lester, K. J.; Eley, T. C.; Margraf, J.","Dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) have been strongly implicated in reward processing of natural stimuli and drugs. Using the approach-avoidance task (AAT), we recently demonstrated that smokers show an increased approach-bias toward smoking-related cues but not toward naturally rewarding stimuli. Here, we examined the contribution of the DRD2 Taq1B polymorphism to smokers' and non-smokers' responsivity toward smoking versus naturally rewarding stimuli in the AAT. Smokers carrying the minor B1 allele of the DRD2 Taq1B polymorphism showed reduced approach behavior for food-related pictures compared to non-smokers with the same allele. In the group of smokers, a higher approach-bias toward smoking-related compared to food-related pictures was found in carriers of the B1 allele. This pattern was not evident in smokers homozygous for the B2 allele. In addition, smokers with the B1 allele reported fewer attempts to quit smoking relative to smokers homozygous for the B2 allele. This is the first study demonstrating that behavioral shifts in response to smoking relative to natural rewards in smokers are mediated by the DRD2 Taq1B polymorphism. Our results indicate a reduced natural-reward brain reactivity in smokers with a genetically determined decrease in dopaminergic activity (i.e., reduction of DRD2 availability). It remains to be determined whether this pattern might be related to a different outcome after psychological cessation interventions, i.e., AAT modification paradigms, in smokers.",2018,Apr,Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,268,3,261-268,28364268.0,10.1007/s00406-017-0793-y,,#889,Zlomuzica 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Paradoxical dopaminergic drug effects in extraversion: dose- and time-dependent effects of sulpiride on EEG theta activity,"Chavanon, M.

In order to better describe these opposite pharmaco-EEG effects and to generate hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanisms, we measured the EEG intermittently over 5 h in 80 healthy male volunteers extremely high or low in aE who had received either placebo or one of three doses of sulpiride (50, 200, or 400 mg). The findings suggest a model postulating stronger pre- vs. postsynaptic subreceptor effects in high aE individuals compared to low aE individuals. Future studies may now systematically apply the model to other examples of paradoxical dopaminergic drug effects and examine the molecular basis of individual differences in pre- vs. postsynaptic dopamine D2 subreceptor sensitivities and densities.",2013,,Front Hum Neurosci,7,,117,23580360.0,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00117,,#890,Chavanon 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Approach bias modification in inpatient psychiatric smokers,"Machulska, A.; Zlomuzica, A.; Rinck, M.; Assion, H. J.; Margraf, J.","Drug-related automatic approach tendencies contribute to the development and maintenance of addictive behavior. The present study investigated whether a nicotine-related approach bias can be modified in smokers undergoing inpatient psychiatric treatment by using a novel training variant of the nicotine Approach-Avoidance-Task (AAT). Additionally, we assessed whether the AAT-training would affect smoking behavior. Inpatient smokers were randomly assigned to either an AAT-training or a sham-training condition. In the AAT-training condition, smokers were indirectly instructed to make avoidance movements in response to nicotine-related pictures and to make approach movements in response to tooth-cleaning pictures. In the sham-training condition, no contingency between picture content und arm movements existed. Trainings were administered in four sessions, accompanied by a brief smoking-cessation intervention. Smoking-related self-report measures and automatic approach biases toward smoking cues were measured before and after training. Three months after training, daily nicotine consumption was obtained. A total of 205 participants were recruited, and data from 139 participants were considered in the final analysis. Prior to the trainings, smokers in both conditions exhibited a stronger approach bias for nicotine-related pictures than for tooth-cleaning pictures. After both trainings, this difference was no longer evident. Although reduced smoking behavior at posttest was observed after both trainings, only the AAT-training led to a larger reduction of nicotine consumption at a three-month follow-up.

Context counts! social anxiety modulates the processing of fearful faces in the context of chemosensory anxiety signals,"Adolph, D.; Meister, L.; Pause, B. M.","During emotion perception, context is an important source of information. Whether contextual cues from modalities other than vision or audition influence the perception of social emotional information has not been investigated. Thus, the present study aimed at testing emotion perception and regulation in response to fearful facial expressions presented in the context of chemosensory stimuli derived from sweat of anxious individuals. In groups of high (HSA) and low socially anxious (LSA) participants we recorded the startle reflex (Experiment I), and analysed event-related potentials (ERPs; Experiment II) while they viewed anxious facial expressions in the context of chemosensory anxiety signals and chemosensory control stimuli. Results revealed that N1/P1 and N170 amplitudes were larger while late positive potential (LPP) activity was smaller for facial expressions presented in the context of the anxiety and the chemosensory control stimulus as compared to facial expressions without a chemosensory context. Furthermore, HSA participants were highly sensitive to the contextual anxiety signals. They showed enhanced motivated attention allocation (LPP, Study II), as well as larger startle responses toward faces in the context of chemosensory anxiety signals than did LSA participants (Study I). Chemosensory context had no effect on emotion regulation, and both LSA and HSA participants showed effective emotion regulation (Study I and II). In conclusion, both anxiety and chemosensory sport context stimuli enhanced early attention allocation and structural encoding, but diminished motivated attention allocation to the facial expressions. The current results show that visual and chemosensory information is integrated on virtually all levels of stimulus processing and that socially anxious individuals might be especially sensitive to chemosensory contextual social information.",2013,,Front Hum Neurosci,7,,283,23801951.0,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00283,,#893,Adolph 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Agents differed in wearing face masks and age (young, elderly). In addition, situational constraints varied in whether keeping a distance of 1.5 m required an effortful detour or not. Wearing face masks (both self and other) reduced physical distancing. This reduction was most prominent when keeping the recommended distance was effortful, suggesting an influence of situational constraints. Similarly, increased distances to elderly were only observed when keeping a recommended distance was effortless.

Nineteen PGs according to DSM-IV and 19 matched control subjects undertook the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) to assess decision-making. The delay discounting paradigm (DDP) as well as the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale (measuring urgency, premeditation, perseverance and sensation seeking) were administered as multidimensional measures of impulsivity. Results revealed that (1) PGs exhibited higher risk seeking and an immediate reward focus in the CGT and, in contrast, comparable strategic planning to the control group. (2) Decision-making impairments were related to more severe delay discounting and, specifically, to increased urgency and less premeditation. Our findings suggest (1) the necessity to disentangle decision-making components in order to improve etiological models of PGs, and (2) that urgency and premeditation are specifically related to disadvantageous decision-making and should be tackled in intervention strategies focusing on emotion tolerance and control strategies.",2014,Mar 30,Psychiatry Res,215,3,675-82,24434041.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2013.12.041,,#898,Kraplin 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

In a cross-sectional study, 70 PTSD patients completed the PTES, the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), as well as measures of the severity of symptoms of PTSD and depression. The results show that the PTES has excellent internal consistency and correlates significantly with the PTCI and PTSD symptom severity. A regression analysis revealed that the PTES explained variance of PTSD symptom severity above the PTCI, supporting the incremental validity of the PTES. While the original version of the PTES comprises 81 items, short scales were constructed using the BISCUIT (best items scales that are cross-validated, unit-weighted, informative and transparent) method. The current findings provide preliminary psychometric evidence suggesting that the PTES is an internally consistent and valid novel self-report measure in patients with PTSD. However, conclusions about the psychometric properties of the PTES are limited because of the absence of criterion-related validity, factor structure evidence, variability over time/response to intervention, and test-retest reliability.

Furthermore, 4.9 ml blood samples were drawn from each participant to assess peripheral plasma oxytocin levels.

Intelligence and Visual Mismatch Negativity: Is Pre-Attentive Visual Discrimination Related to General Cognitive Ability?,"Hilger, K.; Euler, M. J.","EEG has been used for decades to identify neurocognitive processes related to intelligence. Evidence is accumulating for associations with neural markers of higher-order cognitive processes (e.g., working memory); however, whether associations are specific to complex processes or also relate to earlier processing stages remains unclear. Addressing these issues has implications for improving our understanding of intelligence and its neural correlates. The MMN is an ERP that is elicited when, within a series of frequent standard stimuli, rare deviant stimuli are presented. As stimuli are typically presented outside the focus of attention, the MMN is suggested to capture automatic pre-attentive discrimination processes. However, the MMN and its relation to intelligence has largely only been studied in the auditory domain, thus preventing conclusions about the involvement of automatic discrimination processes in humans' dominant sensory modality-vision. EEG was recorded from 50 healthy participants during a passive visual oddball task that presented simple sequence violations and deviations within a more complex hidden pattern. Signed area amplitudes and fractional area latencies of the visual MMN were calculated with and without Laplacian transformation. Correlations between visual MMN and intelligence (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices) were of negligible to small effect sizes, differed critically between measurement approaches, and Bayes Factors provided anecdotal to substantial evidence for the absence of an association. We discuss differences between the auditory and visual MMN, the implications of different measurement approaches, and offer recommendations for further research in this evolving field.",2022,Nov 28,J Cogn Neurosci,35,2,1-17,36473095.0,10.1162/jocn_a_01946,,#905,Hilger 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

C.","Effective natural communication requires listeners to incorporate not only very general linguistic principles which evolved during a lifetime but also other information like the specific individual language use of a particular interlocutor. Traditionally, research has focused on the general linguistic rules, and brain science has shown a left hemispheric fronto-temporal brain network related to this processing. The present fMRI research explores speaker-specific individual language use because it is unknown whether this processing is supported by similar or distinct neural structures. Twenty-eight participants listened to sentences of persons who used more easy or difficult language. This was done by manipulating the proportion of easy SOV vs. complex OSV sentences for each speaker. Furthermore, ambiguous probe sentences were included to test top-down influences of speaker information in the absence of syntactic structure information. We observed distinct neural processing for syntactic complexity and speaker-specific language use. Syntactic complexity correlated with left frontal and posterior temporal regions. Speaker-specific processing correlated with bilateral (right-dominant) fronto-parietal brain regions. Finally, the top-down influence of speaker information was found in frontal and striatal brain regions, suggesting a mechanism for controlled syntactic processing. These findings show distinct neural networks related to general language principles as well as speaker-specific individual language use.",2020,,Cereb Cortex Commun,1,1,tgaa021,34296098.0,10.1093/texcom/tgaa021,,#907,Kroczek 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Ready for eHealth? Health Professionals' Acceptance and Adoption of eHealth Interventions in Inpatient Routine Care,"Hennemann, S.; Beutel, M.

The present study therefore aimed to investigate barriers and facilitators to acceptance of eHealth interventions and of online aftercare in particular in health professionals of inpatient treatment. A total of 152 out of 287 health professionals of various professional groups in four inpatient rehabilitation facilities filled out a self-administered web-based questionnaire (response rate: 53%); 128 individuals were eligible for further data analysis. Acceptance and possible predictors were investigated with a complex research model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Acceptance of eHealth interventions was rather low (M = 2.47, SD = 0.98); however, acceptance of online aftercare was moderate (M = 3.08, SD = 0.96, t(127) = 8.22, p < .001), and eHealth literacy was elevated. Social influence, performance expectancy, and treatment-related internet and mobile use significantly predicted overall acceptance. No differences were found between professional and age groups.

Learning dynamics of electrophysiological brain signals during human fear conditioning,"Sperl, M. F. J.; Wroblewski, A.; Mueller, M.; Straube, B.; Mueller, E. M.","Electrophysiological studies in rodents allow recording neural activity during threats with high temporal and spatial precision. Although fMRI has helped translate insights about the anatomy of underlying brain circuits to humans, the temporal dynamics of neural fear processes remain opaque and require EEG. To date, studies on electrophysiological brain signals in humans have helped to elucidate underlying perceptual and attentional processes, but have widely ignored how fear memory traces evolve over time. The low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG demands aggregations across high numbers of trials, which will wash out transient neurobiological processes that are induced by learning and prone to habituation. Here, our goal was to unravel the plasticity and temporal emergence of EEG responses during fear conditioning. To this end, we developed a new sequential-set fear conditioning paradigm that comprises three successive acquisition and extinction phases, each with a novel CS+/CS- set. Each set consists of two different neutral faces on different background colors which serve as CS+ and CS-, respectively. Thereby, this design provides sufficient trials for EEG analyses while tripling the relative amount of trials that tap into more transient neurobiological processes. Consistent with prior studies on ERP components, data-driven topographic EEG analyses revealed that ERP amplitudes were potentiated during time periods from 33-60 ms, 108-200 ms, and 468-820 ms indicating that fear conditioning prioritizes early sensory processing in the brain, but also facilitates neural responding during later attentional and evaluative stages. Importantly, averaging across the three CS+/CS- sets allowed us to probe the temporal evolution of neural processes: Responses during each of the three time windows gradually increased from early to late fear conditioning, while long-latency (460-730 ms) electrocortical responses diminished throughout fear extinction. Our novel paradigm demonstrates how short-, mid-, and long-latency EEG responses change during fear conditioning and extinction, findings that enlighten the learning curve of neurophysiological responses to threat in humans.",2021,Feb 1,NeuroImage,226,,117569,33221446.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117569,,#910,Sperl 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Less clear is why people with psychosis fail to regulate distressing emotions effectively. This study tests whether subjective, psychophysiological and symptomatic responses to stress can be predicted by specific emotion regulation (ER) difficulties. Participants with psychotic disorders (n=35) and healthy controls (n=28) were assessed for ER-skills at baseline. They were then exposed to a noise versus no stressor on different days, during which self-reported stress responses, state paranoia and skin conductance levels (SCL) were assessed. Participants with psychosis showed a stronger increase in self-reported stress and SCL in response to the stressor than healthy controls. Stronger increases in self-reported stress were predicted by a reduced ability to be aware of and tolerate distressing emotions, whereas increases in SCL were predicted by a reduced ability to be aware of, tolerate, accept and modify them. Although paranoid symptoms were not significantly affected by the stressors, individual variation in paranoid responses was also predicted by a reduced ability to be aware of and tolerate emotions. Differences in stress responses in the samples were no longer significant after controlling for ER skills.

In this study, a checklist of emotionally stressful events for the German EMS was introduced. A mixed-method approach was used to identify mission events that were critical for the development of mental and physical stress symptoms. Data were collected in a cross-sectional sample of 102 EMS employees. A quantitative content analysis of the participants' worst experiences on duty indicated, traumatic missions to be a concatenation of two to five emotionally stressful events. Rescue missions were experienced as traumatic if (i) EMS personnel became victims of attacks or threats; (ii) certain circumstances caused them to give up their professional detachment from patients; (iii) EMS personnel perceived the overall mission as exceptionally tragic. In subsequent correlation analyses, the corresponding checklist items showed consistent positive associations with the post-traumatic, depressive and physical stress symptoms among the study cohort. Within the exploratory regressions, the sum score of critical on-duty exposures contributed incrementally to the prediction of mental and physical stress symptoms when non-work-related trauma exposure and perceived social support were also considered. Findings point toward the importance of considering the cumulative burden of critical incidents for the long-term health of EMS personnel.

"Event-related brain responses to emotional words, pictures, and faces - a cross-domain comparison","Bayer, M.; Schacht, A.","Emotion effects in event-related brain potentials (ERPs) have previously been reported for a range of visual stimuli, including emotional words, pictures, and facial expressions. Still, little is known about the actual comparability of emotion effects across these stimulus classes. The present study aimed to fill this gap by investigating emotion effects in response to words, pictures, and facial expressions using a blocked within-subject design. Furthermore, ratings of stimulus arousal and valence were collected from an independent sample of participants. Modulations of early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive complex (LPC) were visible for all stimulus domains, but showed clear differences, particularly in valence processing. While emotion effects were limited to positive stimuli for words, they were predominant for negative stimuli in pictures and facial expressions. These findings corroborate the notion of a positivity offset for words and a negativity bias for pictures and facial expressions, which was assumed to be caused by generally lower arousal levels of written language. Interestingly, however, these assumed differences were not confirmed by arousal ratings. Instead, words were rated as overall more positive than pictures and facial expressions. Taken together, the present results point toward systematic differences in the processing of written words and pictorial stimuli of emotional content, not only in terms of a valence bias evident in ERPs, but also concerning their emotional evaluation captured by ratings of stimulus valence and arousal.",2014,2014/10/06,Front Psychol,5,,1106,25339927.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01106,,#914,Bayer 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Associated valence impacts early visual processing of letter strings: Evidence from ERPs in a cross-modal learning paradigm,"Bayer, M.; Grass, A.; Schacht, A.","Emotion effects in event-related potentials (ERPs) during reading have been observed at very short latencies of around 100 to 200 ms after word onset. The nature of these effects remains a matter of debate: First, it is possible that they reflect semantic access, which might thus occur much faster than proposed by most reading models. Second, it is possible that associative learning of a word's shape might contribute to the emergence of emotion effects during visual processing. The present study addressed this question by employing an associative learning paradigm on pronounceable letter strings (pseudowords). In a learning session, letter strings were associated with positive, neutral, or negative valence by means of monetary gain, loss, or zero outcome. Crucially, half of the stimuli were learned in the visual modality, while the other half was presented acoustically, allowing for experimental separation of associated valence and physical percept. In a test session one or two days later, acquired letter strings were presented in an old/new decision task while we recorded ERPs. Behavioural data showed an advantage for gain-associated stimuli both during learning and in the delayed old/new task. Early emotion effects in ERPs were limited to visually acquired letter strings, but absent for acoustically acquired letter strings. These results imply that associative learning of a word's visual features might play an important role in the emergence of emotion effects at the stage of perceptual processing.",2019,Feb,Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci,19,1,98-108,30341624.0,10.3758/s13415-018-00647-2,,#915,Bayer 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
How you think about an emotion predicts how you regulate: an experience-sampling study,"Wittkamp, M. F.; Nowak, U.; Clamor, A.; Lincoln, T.

Frontiers in Psychiatry, 12, 118), namely that the extent to which individuals evaluate an emotion as harmful and their personal resources to modify and accept/tolerate the emotion as sufficient predict the subsequent use of regulation strategies. Participants (n = 118) from a community sample took part in an experience-sampling assessment over 7 days including 10 daily paired measurements. The first measured momentary affective valence and arousal along with harmfulness evaluations and evaluations of personal resources to modify and accept/tolerate an emotion. The second followed three minutes later and measured emotion regulation strategies. The more harmful individuals evaluated an emotion, the more likely they were to use an emotion regulation strategy. The more harmful individuals evaluated an emotion, and the less sufficient they evaluated their personal resources to accept/tolerate an emotion, the more likely they were to use a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy. We conclude that emotions that people evaluate as harmful or difficult to accept are most likely to be regulated in a maladaptive manner.

"Cognitive flexibility, heart rate variability, and resilience predict fine-grained regulation of arousal during prolonged threat","Hildebrandt, L. K.; McCall, C.; Engen, H. G.; Singer, T.","Emotion regulation in the ongoing presence of a threat is essential for adaptive behavior. Threatening situations change over time and, as a consequence, require a fine-tuned, dynamic regulation of arousal to match the current state of the environment. Constructs such as cognitive flexibility, heart rate variability, and resilience have been proposed as resources for adaptive emotion regulation, especially in a moment-to-moment fashion. Nevertheless, none of these constructs has been empirically related to the dynamic regulation of arousal as it unfolds over the course of a prolonged threatening episode. Here, we do so by placing participants in a threatening and evolving immersive virtual environment called Room 101, while recording their skin conductance. Subsequently, participants rated their subjective arousal continuously over the course of the experience. Participants who had shown greater cognitive flexibility in a separate task (i.e., fewer task-switching costs when switching to evaluating the valence of positive stimuli) showed better regulation of physiological arousal (skin conductance level), during less-threatening phases of Room 101. Individuals with higher trait resilience and individuals with higher resting heart rate variability showed more regulation in terms of their subjective arousal experience. The results indicate that emotional, cognitive, and physiological flexibility support nuanced adaptive regulation of objective and experienced arousal in the ongoing presence of threats. Furthermore, the results indicate that these forms of flexibility differentially affect automatic and objective versus reflective and subjective processes.",2016,Jun,Psychophysiology,53,6,880-90,26899260.0,10.1111/psyp.12632,,#917,Hildebrandt 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Life contexts make a difference: emotional stability in younger and older adults,"Brose, A.; Scheibe, S.; Schmiedek, F.","Emotional stability, as indicated by low affect variability and low affective reactivity to daily events, for example, tends to increase across the adult life span. This study investigated a contextual explanation for such age differences, relating affect variability and affective reactivity to age-group-specific life contexts. A sample of 101 younger and 103 older adults reported daily stressors and negative affect across 100 days. Compared with younger adults, older adults (a) experienced fewer stressors overall, (b) had less heterogeneous stressor profiles, and (c) reported that stressors had less impact on daily routines. As expected, these contextual factors were relevant for interindividual differences in emotional stability. Multiple regression analyses revealed that reduced affect variability and affective reactivity in older adults were associated with these age-group specific life contexts. Moreover, matching younger and older adults on the contextual factors to explore the effects of context on age-group differences further provided support for the (partially) contextual explanation of age differences in emotional stability. Matched subgroups of younger and older adults that were comparable on contextual variables were identified. Affective variability, but not affective reactivity, was more similar in the matched subsamples than in the total samples of younger and older adults.

How 'love' and 'hate' differ from 'sleep': using combined electro/magnetoencephalographic data to reveal the sources of early cortical responses to emotional words,"Keuper, K.; Zwanzger, P.; Nordt, M.; Eden, A.; Laeger, I.; Zwitserlood, P.; Kissler, J.; Junghofer, M.; Dobel, C.","Emotional words--as symbols for biologically relevant concepts--are preferentially processed in brain regions including the visual cortex, frontal and parietal regions, and a corticolimbic circuit including the amygdala. Some of the brain structures found in functional magnetic resonance imaging are not readily apparent in electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG; MEG) measures. By means of a combined EEG/MEG source localization procedure to fully exploit the available information, we sought to reduce these discrepancies and gain a better understanding of spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying emotional-word processing. Eighteen participants read high-arousing positive and negative, and low-arousing neutral nouns, while EEG and MEG were recorded simultaneously. Combined current-density reconstructions (L2-minimum norm least squares) for two early emotion-sensitive time intervals, the P1 (80-120 ms) and the early posterior negativity (EPN, 200-300 ms), were computed using realistic individual head models with a cortical constraint. The P1 time window uncovered an emotion effect peaking in the left middle temporal gyrus. In the EPN time window, processing of emotional words was associated with enhanced activity encompassing parietal and occipital areas, and posterior limbic structures. We suggest that lexical access, being underway within 100 ms, is speeded and/or favored for emotional words, possibly on the basis of an ""emotional tagging"" of the word form during acquisition. This gives rise to their differential processing in the EPN time window. The EPN, as an index of natural selective attention, appears to reflect an elaborate interplay of distributed structures, related to cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and evaluation of emotional stimuli.",2014,Mar,Hum Brain Mapp,35,3,875-88,23281129.0,10.1002/hbm.22220,,#921,Keuper 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

P.; Lowisch, K.; Westermann, N.; Riesel, A.","Enhanced amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) have been suggested to be a transdiagnostic neural risk marker for internalizing psychopathology. Previous studies propose worry to be an underlying mechanism driving the association between enhanced ERN and anxiety. The present preregistered study focused on disentangling possible effects of trait and state worry on the ERN by utilizing a cross sectional observational and a longitudinal randomized controlled experimental design. To this end, we examined the ERN of n = 90 students during a flanker task (T0), which were then randomly assigned to one of three groups (worry induction, worry reduction, passive control group). Following the intervention, participants performed another flanker task (T1) to determine potential alterations of their ERN. Manipulation checks revealed that compared to the control group, state worry increased in the induction but also in the reduction group. ERN amplitudes did not vary as a function of state worry. An association of trait worry with larger ERN amplitudes was only observed in females. Furthermore, we found larger ERN amplitudes in participants with a current or lifetime diagnosis of internalizing disorders. In summary, our findings suggest that the ERN seems to be insensitive to variations in state worry, but that an elevated ERN is associated with the trait-like tendency to worry and internalizing psychopathology, which is consistent with the notion that the ERN likely represents a trait-like neural risk associated with anxiety.",2022,Sep,Psychophysiology,59,9,e14055,35353909.0,10.1111/psyp.14055,,#929,Harpfer 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Generalization of Contextual Fear in Humans,"Andreatta, M.; Leombruni, E.; Glotzbach-Schoon, E.; Pauli, P.; Muhlberger, A.","Enhanced fear responses to cues, which were not associated with the threat but share perceptual characteristics with the threat signal, indicate generalization of conditioned fear. Here, we investigated for the first time generalization processes in contextual fear conditioning. Thirty-two participants were guided through two virtual offices (acquisition phases). Mildly painful electric shocks (unconditioned stimulus, US) were unpredictably delivered in one office (anxiety context, CTX+), but never in the other office (safety context, CTX-). During the generalization test, participants were guided through CTX+, CTX-, and the generalization context (G-CTX), which contained features of both the CTX+ and the CTX-, but no US was delivered. We found successful contextual fear conditioning (i.e., the CTX+ compared to the CTX- elicited potentiated startle responses and was rated with more negative valence, higher arousal and higher anxiety). Importantly, implicit and explicit responses dissociated in the generalization test. Thus, participants rated the G-CTX as more arousing and anxiogenic than the CTX- indicating anxiety generalization, but they showed enhanced startle responses to the CTX+ only, while the G-CTX and the CTX- did not differ. In summary, healthy participants on an explicit level responded to the generalization context like to the anxiety context, but on an implicit level responded to the generalization context like to the safety context. Possibly, this dissociation suggests distinct and specific generalization processes underlying contextual fear.",2015,Sep,Behav Ther,46,5,583-96,26459839.0,10.1016/j.beth.2014.12.008,,#930,Andreatta 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Self-focused attention vs. negative attentional bias during public speech task in socially anxious individuals,"Lin, M.; Wen, X.; Qian, M.; He, D.; Zlomuzica, A.","Enhanced self-focused attention (SFA) and negative attentional bias (NAB) towards social cues are characteristic hallmarks of social anxiety. It is essential to investigate these two attentional phenomena under socially relevant situations using comparable stimuli. In the present study, individuals with high social anxiety (HSA, n = 32) and low social anxiety (LSA, n = 29) were compared according to their attention toward self-related stimuli and toward positive, neutral, and negative feedback related stimuli. Video stimuli of moving indicators of self-anxiety-status and positive, neutral, and negative feedback from an audience were presented during an impromptu speech task (high anxiety condition) and a re-watching phase (low anxiety condition). Eye movements in response to the different stimuli served as readouts for attentional preference. An interaction effect suggested that the HSA group directed more attention to self-related stimuli relative to other stimuli and the LSA group only during the high anxiety condition. The LSA group exhibited a general attentional preference toward positive feedback, especially during the low anxiety condition. Meanwhile, only the total duration of fixation on positive feedback negatively correlated with subjective anxiety rating.

Twenty-five items assessing different aspects of sleep, including overall sleep quality, specific sleep parameters, nocturnal restoration, and exposure-related questions, were tested. This involved coherence with objective polysomnographic (PSG) laboratory measurements of sleep in 47 participants and application of selected items under field conditions in over 3,000 participants. Items on overall sleep quality correlated significantly with PSG data. For specific sleep parameter questions, tiredness in the morning, time to fall asleep, difficulties to sleep and estimated number of awakenings were correlated to PSG data. Questions asking specifically about the effect of potential sleep disturbances correlated poorly with PSG data, but showed highest effects between environmental exposure (noise and vibration) and control nights in the laboratory and highest correlation with the dose of exposure in the field.

"Emotions and persecutory ideation in daily life: On the trail of the ""chicken and egg"" problem","Krkovic, K.; Clamor, A.; Schlier, B.; Lincoln, T. M.","Etiological models highlight the importance of emotions for the emergence of persecutory ideation. To increase our understanding of their exacerbation, we tested whether this process can be explained by a vicious cycle of negative emotions and persecutory ideation in daily life. Furthermore, we examined whether this process differs in people with and without a psychotic disorder by testing a sample of 34 individuals with elevated psychotic experiences without a diagnosis (subclinical sample) and a sample of 33 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (clinical sample). In both samples, we applied the experience sampling method for 1 week to acquire repeated measures of sadness, fear, anger, shame, and persecutory ideation. Multilevel models showed that all tested negative emotions were associated with persecutory ideation measured at the same time point (p < .05) in both samples. Fear predicted subsequent persecutory ideation (p < .05). There was a moderating effect between sample and anger and sample and sadness predicting subsequent persecutory ideation (p < .05), with these associations being stronger in the subclinical sample. Finally, persecutory ideation predicted subsequent fear, anger, sadness, and shame (p < .05) without a moderating effect of the sample. Hence, the results showed an emotion-unspecific rather than an emotion-specific vicious cycle of negative emotions and persecutory ideation, which possibly contributes to symptom exacerbation and maintenance.

To explore potential moderators, we compared two films (Study 1; N = 64) and modulated reappraisal (Study 2; N = 72). As expected, left frontal activation during film viewing predicted dampened responses in individuals who viewed a staged road accident. However, this effect tended to be reversed when a genocide documentary was used. In Study 2, all participants viewed the genocide film.

Predictors of behavioral avoidance during respiratory symptom provocation,"Benke, C.; Krause, E.; Hamm, A. O.; Pane-Farre, C.

Previous studies examined psychological (anxiety sensitivity, fear of suffocation and trait anxiety) and biobehavioral (breath-holding time) predictors of reported anxiety during symptom provocation. However, the role of these predictors on avoidance of feared body symptoms remains unclear. Therefore, the present work aimed at investigating the main and interactive effects of psychological and biobehavioral variables in predicting avoidance during provocation of dyspnea that successively increased in severity. 28 of 69 participants prematurely terminated the provocation sequence, thus preventing further progression of symptom provocation. Logistic regressions revealed that higher anxiety sensitivity and lower breath-holding time were significantly associated with avoidance during exposure. Suffocation fear and trait anxiety were not related to avoidance. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between breath-holding time and anxiety sensitivity in predicting avoidance. Participants with a lower breath-holding time showed more avoidance behavior when reporting high as compared to low anxiety sensitivity. The data suggest that anxiety sensitivity and breath-holding time increase the risk to show avoidance and thus might contribute to the development and maintenance of anxiety-related disorders.",2019,Jan,Behav Res Ther,112,,63-67,30502722.0,10.1016/j.brat.2018.11.012,,#938,Benke 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Emotion regulation as a moderator of the interplay between self-reported and physiological stress and paranoia,"Krkovic, K.; Krink, S.; Lincoln, T. M.","Experience sampling method (ESM) studies have found an association between daily stress and paranoid symptoms, but it is uncertain whether these findings generalize to physiological indicators of stress. Moreover, the temporality of the association and its moderating factors require further research. Here, we investigate whether physiological and self-rated daily stress predict subsequent paranoid symptoms and analyze the role of emotion regulation as a putative moderator. We applied ESM during 24 h to repeatedly assess heart rate, self-rated stress, and subclinical paranoia in a sample of 67 psychosis-prone individuals as measured with Community Assessment for Psychotic Experiences (CAPE). Adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation was assessed at baseline with the Emotion Regulation Skills Questionnaire (ERSQ-ES) and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ). Linear mixed models were used to analyze the data. Heart rate (b = 0.004, p < 0.05) and self-rated stress (b = 0.238, p < 0.001) predicted subsequent paranoia.

Causal attribution for mental illness in Cuba: A thematic analysis,"Nohr, L.; Steinhauser, T.; Ruiz, A. L.; Ferrer, J. E. S.; Lersner, U. V.","Explanatory models (EMs) for illness are highly relevant for patients, and they are also important for clinical diagnoses and treatment. EMs serve to capture patients' personal illness narratives and can help reveal how culture influences these narratives. While much research has aimed to understand EMs in the Western hemisphere, less research has been done on other cultures. Therefore, we investigated local causal attributions for mental illness in Cuba because of its particular history and political system. Although Cuban culture shares many values with Latin American cultures because of Spanish colonization, it is unique because of its socialist political and economic context, which might influence causal attributions. Thus, we developed a qualitative interview outline based on the Clinical Ethnographic Interview and administered interviews to 14 psychiatric patients in Havana. We conducted a thematic analysis to identify repeated patterns of meaning. Six patterns of causal attribution for mental illness were identified: (1) Personal shortcomings, (2) Family influences, (3) Excessive demands, (4) Cultural, economic, and political environment in Cuba, (5) Physical causes, and (6) Symptom-related explanations. In our sample, we found general and Cuba-specific patterns of causal attributions, whereby the Cuba-specific themes mainly locate the causes of mental illness outside the individual. These findings might be related to Cubans' socio-centric personal orientation, the cultural value of familismo and common daily experiences within socialist Cuban society.

Arousal Predisposition as a Vulnerability Indicator for Psychosis: A General Population Online Stress Induction Study,"Clamor, A.; Warmuth, A. M.; Lincoln, T. M.","Explanatory models ascribe to arousability a central role for the development of psychotic symptoms. Thus, a disposition to hyperarousal (i.e., increased arousal predisposition (AP)) may serve as an underlying vulnerability indicator for psychosis by interacting with stressors to cause symptoms. In this case, AP, stress-response, and psychotic symptoms should be linked before the development of a diagnosable psychotic disorder. We conducted a cross-sectional online study in a population sample (N = 104; M age = 27.7 years, SD = 11.2, range 18-70). Participants rated their AP and subclinical psychotic symptoms. Participants reported their stress-levels before and after two stress inductions including an arithmetic and a social stressor. The participants with an increased AP generally felt more stressed. However, AP was not associated with the specific stress-response. As expected, positive psychotic symptoms were significantly associated with AP, but this was not mediated by general stress-levels. Its association to subtle, nonclinical psychotic symptoms supports our assumption that AP could be a vulnerability indicator for psychosis. The trait is easily accessible via a short self-report and could facilitate the identification of people at risk and be a promising target for early stress-management. Further research is needed to clarify its predictive value for stress-responses.",2015,,Schizophr Res Treatment,2015,,725136,26199758.0,10.1155/2015/725136,,#943,Clamor 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Multiple extinction contexts modulate the neural correlates of context-dependent extinction learning and retrieval,"Hermann, A.; Stark, R.; Muller, E. A.; Kruse, O.; Wolf, O. T.; Merz, C. J.","Exposure therapy is a successful treatment for patients with anxiety and fear-related disorders. Extinction of conditioned fear comprises one important mechanism underlying the effects of exposure therapy. Yet, relapses frequently occur in the long-term, probably related to difficulties in generalizing the extinction of conditioned fear to new contexts, leading to renewal of conditioned fear. Extinction training in multiple extinction contexts depicts a promising opportunity to reduce this renewal of conditioned fear. However, the underlying neural correlates are unknown yet. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 49 healthy men participated in a fear conditioning paradigm with fear acquisition training in context A on a first day, extinction training in a single context (B1) or in four different contexts (B1-B4) one day later, and fear and extinction recall and reinstatement in context B1 and a novel context C on a third day one week later. Multiple extinction contexts led to a stronger differential activation decrease in the hippocampus during extinction learning compared to a single extinction context. One week later, the multiple context group compared with the single context group showed reduced differential amygdala activation during fear renewal in the novel context C compared with the extinction context B1. Furthermore, multiple extinction contexts diminished amygdala activation during a subsequent reinstatement test in context B1. However, there were no significant differences in differential conditioned SCRs.

"The Struggle of Behavioral Therapists With Exposure: Self-Reported Practicability, Negative Beliefs, and Therapist Distress About Exposure-Based Interventions","Pittig, A.; Kotter, R.; Hoyer, J.","Exposure-based interventions are a core ingredient of evidence-based cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, previous research has documented that exposure is rarely utilized in routine care, highlighting an ongoing lack of dissemination. The present study examined barriers for the dissemination of exposure from the perspective of behavioral psychotherapists working in outpatient routine care (N = 684). A postal survey assessed three categories of barriers: (a) practicability of exposure-based intervention in an outpatient private practice setting, (b) negative beliefs about exposure, and (c) therapist distress related to the use of exposure. In addition, self-reported competence to conduct exposure for different anxiety disorders, PTSD, and OCD was assessed. High rates of agreement were found for single barriers within each of the three categories (e.g., unpredictable time management, risk of uncompensated absence of the patient, risk of decompensation of the patient, superficial effectiveness, or exposure being very strenuous for the therapist). Separately, average agreement to each category negatively correlated with self-reported utilization of exposure to a moderate degree (-.35 </= r </= -.27). In a multiple regression model, only average agreement to barriers of practicability and negative beliefs were significantly associated with utilization rates. Findings illustrate that a multilevel approach targeting individual, practical, and systemic barriers is necessary to optimize the dissemination of exposure-based interventions. Dissemination efforts may therefore benefit from incorporating strategies such as modifying negative beliefs, adaptive stress management for therapists, or increasing practicability of exposure-based interventions.",2019,Mar,Behav Ther,50,2,353-366,30824251.0,10.1016/j.beth.2018.07.003,,#945,Pittig 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The role of FKBP5 genotype in moderating long-term effectiveness of exposure-based psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder,"Wilker, S.; Pfeiffer, A.; Kolassa, S.; Elbert, T.; Lingenfelder, B.; Ovuga, E.; Papassotiropoulos, A.; de Quervain, D.; Kolassa, I. T.","Exposure-based therapies are considered the state-of-the-art treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Yet, a substantial number of PTSD patients do not recover after therapy. In the light of the well-known gene x environment interactions on the risk for PTSD, research on individual genetic factors that influence treatment success is warranted. The gene encoding FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5), a co-chaperone of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), has been associated with stress reactivity and PTSD risk. As FKBP5 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1360780 has a putative functional role in the regulation of FKBP5 expression and GR sensitivity, we hypothesized that this polymorphism influences PTSD treatment success. We investigated the effects of FKBP5 rs1360780 genotype on Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) outcome, an exposure-based short-term therapy, in a sample of 43 survivors of the rebel war in Northern Uganda. PTSD symptom severity was assessed before and 4 and 10 months after treatment completion. At the 4-month follow-up, there were no genotype-dependent differences in therapy outcome. However, the FKBP5 genotype significantly moderated the long-term effectiveness of exposure-based psychotherapy. At the 10-month follow-up, carriers of the rs1360780 risk (T) allele were at increased risk of symptom relapse, whereas non-carriers showed continuous symptom reduction. This effect was reflected in a weaker treatment effect size (Cohen's D=1.23) in risk allele carriers compared with non-carriers (Cohen's D=3.72).

A positive association between the patients' pretreatment extinction learning performance and treatment outcome would corroborate the hypothesis. Indeed, there is first correlational evidence between reduced extinction learning and therapy efficacy. However, the results of these association studies may be hampered by extinction-training protocols that do not match treatment procedures. Therefore, we developed an extinction-training protocol highly tailored to the procedure of exposure therapy and tested it in two samples of 46 subjects in total. By using instructed fear acquisition training, including a consolidation period overnight, we wanted to ensure that the conditioned fear response was well established prior to extinction training, which is the case in patients with anxiety disorders prior to treatment. Moreover, the extinction learning process was analyzed on multiple response levels, comprising unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy ratings, autonomic responses, defensive brain stem reflexes, and neural activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using this protocol, we found robust fear conditioning and slow-speed extinction learning. We also observed within-group heterogeneity in extinction learning, albeit a stable fear response at the beginning of the extinction training. Finally, we found discordance between different response systems, suggesting that multiple processes are involved in extinction learning.

Much less is known about whether a similar preference is also evident in covert attentional processes. To enable a direct comparison, this study examined covert and overt attentional guidance within two different experimental setups using complex naturalistic scenes instead of isolated single features. In the first experiment, a modified version of the dot-probe paradigm served as a measure of covert reflexive attention toward briefly presented scenes containing a social feature in one half of the visual field compared to nonsocial elements in the other while controlling for low-level visual saliency. Participants showed a stable congruency effect with faster reaction times and fewer errors for probes presented on the social side of the scene. In a second experiment, we tracked eye movements for the same set of stimuli while manipulating the presentation time to allow for differentiating reflexive and more sustained aspects of overt attention. Supportive of the first results, analyses revealed a robust preference for social features concerning initial saccade direction as well as fixation allocation. Collectively, these experiments imply preferential processing of social features over visually salient aspects for automatic allocation of covert as well as overt attention.",2018,Nov 1,J Vis,18,12,11,30458516.0,10.1167/18.12.11,,#949,Flechsenhar 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Face masks impair facial emotion recognition and induce specific emotion confusions,"Rinck, M.; Primbs, M. A.; Verpaalen, I. A. M.; Bijlstra, G.","Face masks are now worn frequently to reduce the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Their health benefits are undisputable, but covering the lower half of one's face also makes it harder for others to recognize facial expressions of emotions. Three experiments were conducted to determine how strongly the recognition of different facial expressions is impaired by masks, and which emotions are confused with each other. In each experiment, participants had to recognize facial expressions of happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust, as well as a neutral expression, displayed by male and female actors of the Radboud Faces Database. On half of the 168 trials, the lower part of the face was covered by a face mask. In all experiments, facial emotion recognition (FER) was about 20% worse for masked faces than for unmasked ones (68% correct vs. 88%). The impairment was largest for disgust, followed by fear, surprise, sadness, and happiness. It was not significant for anger and the neutral expression. As predicted, participants frequently confused emotions that share activation of the visible muscles in the upper half of the face. In addition, they displayed response biases in these confusions: They frequently misinterpreted disgust as anger, fear as surprise, and sadness as neutral, whereas the opposite confusions were less frequent. We conclude that face masks do indeed cause a marked impairment of FER and that a person perceived as angry, surprised, or neutral may actually be disgusted, fearful, or sad, respectively.

The Influence of Task-Irrelevant Flankers Depends on the Composition of Emotion Categories,"Schulte Holthausen, B.; Regenbogen, C.; Turetsky, B. I.; Schneider, F.; Habel, U.","Face recognition usually takes place in a social context, where faces are surrounded by other stimuli. These can act as distracting flankers which impair recognition. Previous work has suggested that flankers expressing negative emotions distract more than positive ones. However, the various negative emotions differ in their relative impact and it is unclear whether all negative emotions are equally distracting. We investigated the impact of three negative (angry, fearful, sad) and one positive (happy) facial flanker conditions on target recognition in an emotion discrimination task. We examined the effect of the receiver's gender, and the impact of two different temporal delays between flanker and target onset, as stimulus onset asynchrony is assumed to affect distractor strength. Participants identified and rated the emotional intensity of target faces surrounded by either face (emotional and neutral) or non-face flankers. Target faces were presented either simultaneously with the flankers, or delayed by 300 ms. Contrary to our hypothesis, negative flankers did not exert stronger distraction effects than positive or neutral flankers. However, happy flankers reduced recognition performance. Results of a follow-up experiment with a balanced number of emotion categories (one positive, one negative and one neutral flanker condition) suggest that the distraction effect of emotional flankers depends on the composition of the emotion categories. Additionally, congruency effects were found to be valence-specific and overruled by threat stimuli. Females responded more quickly and rated targets in happy flankers as less intense. This indicates a gender difference in emotion processing, with greater sensitivity to facial flankers in women. Targets were rated as more intense when they were presented without a temporal delay, possibly due to a stronger flanker contrast. These three experiments show that an exceptional processing of threat-related flanker stimuli depends on emotion category composition, which should be considered a mediating factor when examining emotional context effects.",2016,2016/05/25,Front Psychol,7,,712,27252665.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00712,,#951,SchulteHolthausen 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

In the current study we investigate how sending a facial emotional expression influenced the evaluation of an emotional expression received in return. Sixty-eight participants were cued to direct a facial emotional expression (happy, angry, neutral) towards a virtual agent in front of them. The virtual agent then responded with either the same or another emotional expression (happy, angry). Evaluation of the response expressions was measured via ratings of valence and arousal as well as EMG recordings of the M. corrugator supercilii and the M. zygomaticus major. Results revealed a significant interaction between the emotion of the initial facial expression and the response expression. Valence of happy response expressions were increased when participants had initially displayed a smile compared to a neutral expression or a frown. This was also reflected in the EMG responses. Initiating an interaction with a smile increased Zygomaticus activation for happy relative to angry response expressions compared to when the interaction was initiated with a frown. In contrast, no interplay of the initial and the response expression was observed in the Corrugator. These findings demonstrate that smiling or frowning at another person can modulate socio-emotional processing of subsequent social cues. Therefore, the present study highlights the interactive nature of facial emotional expressions.",2022,Nov,Biol Psychol,175,,108453,36347358.0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2022.108453,,#952,Kroczek 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Intranasal oxytocin modulates brain responses to voice-identity recognition in typically developing individuals, but not in ASD","Borowiak, K.; von Kriegstein, K.","Faces and voices are prominent cues for person-identity recognition. Face recognition behavior and associated brain responses can be enhanced by intranasal administration of oxytocin. It is unknown whether oxytocin can also augment voice-identity recognition mechanisms. To find it out is particularly relevant for individuals who have difficulties recognizing voice identity such as individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We conducted a combined behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate voice-identity recognition following intranasal administration of oxytocin or placebo in a group of adults diagnosed with ASD (full-scale intelligence quotient > 85) and pairwise-matched typically developing (TD) controls. A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and cross-over design. In the control group, but not in the ASD group, administration of oxytocin compared to placebo increased responses to recognition of voice identity in contrast to speech in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (pSTS/G) - a region implicated in the perceptual analysis of voice-identity information. In the ASD group, the right pSTS/G responses were positively correlated with voice-identity recognition accuracy in the oxytocin condition, but not in the placebo condition. Oxytocin did not improve voice-identity recognition performance at the group level. The ASD compared to the control group had lower right pSTS/G responses to voice-identity recognition. Since ASD is known to have atypical pSTS/G, the results indicate that the potential of intranasal oxytocin to enhance mechanisms for voice-identity recognition might be variable and dependent on the functional integrity of this brain region.",2020,Jul 7,Transl Psychiatry,10,1,221,32636360.0,10.1038/s41398-020-00903-5,,#953,Borowiak 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Dorsal-movement and ventral-form regions are functionally connected during visual-speech recognition,"Borowiak, K.; Maguinness, C.; von Kriegstein, K.","Faces convey social information such as emotion and speech. Facial emotion processing is supported via interactions between dorsal-movement and ventral-form visual cortex regions. Here, we explored, for the first time, whether similar dorsal-ventral interactions (assessed via functional connectivity), might also exist for visual-speech processing. We then examined whether altered dorsal-ventral connectivity is observed in adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a disorder associated with impaired visual-speech recognition. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with concurrent eye tracking in pairwise matched control and ASD participants. In both groups, dorsal-movement regions in the visual motion area 5 (V5/MT) and the temporal visual speech area (TVSA) were functionally connected to ventral-form regions (i.e., the occipital face area [OFA] and the fusiform face area [FFA]) during the recognition of visual speech, in contrast to the recognition of face identity. Notably, parts of this functional connectivity were decreased in the ASD group compared to the controls (i.e., right V5/MT-right OFA, left TVSA-left FFA). The results confirmed our hypothesis that functional connectivity between dorsal-movement and ventral-form regions exists during visual-speech processing. Its partial dysfunction in ASD might contribute to difficulties in the recognition of dynamic face information relevant for successful face-to-face communication.",2020,Mar,Hum Brain Mapp,41,4,952-972,31749219.0,10.1002/hbm.24852,,#954,Borowiak 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Acute stress enhances the sensitivity for facial emotions: a signal detection approach,"Domes, G.; Zimmer, P.","Facial emotion recognition is an important prerequisite for social cognition. There is, however, limited evidence on how the ability to detect facial emotions is influenced by acute stress and the associated physiological reactions. In this study, two groups of healthy male participants were either exposed to a psychosocial stressor - an adaptation of the Trier Social Stress Test in virtual reality (n = 23) - or a non-stressful control task in the virtual environment (n = 20). Afterwards, both groups completed a computerized facial recognition task based on the signal detection theory presenting happy vs. angry faces with three different expression intensities. Saliva samples were taken at seven time points over the course of the experiment and used to analyze concentrations of free salivary cortisol and alpha amylase. Analyses using repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed a significant increase in emotion detection performance and significantly shorter response latencies in the stress group independent of emotional valence or emotion intensity. However, increased task performance in the stress group could not be predicted by stress-induced cortisol or alpha amylase secretion. The results suggest that enhanced detection of emotional cues after stress might be an adaptive response as an increased sensitivity to social cues might help individuals to detect potential threats or sources of social support in their social environment. Lay Summary Socially evaluative stress facilitates the subsequent recognition of emotions. After having performed a task in a virtual environment, two groups of participants were asked to detect emotion expressions on pictures of faces that were presented to them on a computer screen. Statistical comparison of groups indicates that the group that had previously been subjected to a stressful job interview showed better results and became faster in detecting displayed emotions than the control group that had previously performed a non-stressful task.",2019,Jul,Stress,22,4,455-460,30938228.0,10.1080/10253890.2019.1593366,,#955,Domes 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Read My Face: Automatic Facial Coding Versus Psychophysiological Indicators of Emotional Valence and Arousal,"Hofling, T. T. A.; Gerdes, A. B. M.; Fohl, U.; Alpers, G. W.","Facial expressions provide insight into a person's emotional experience. To automatically decode these expressions has been made possible by tremendous progress in the field of computer vision. Researchers are now able to decode emotional facial expressions with impressive accuracy in standardized images of prototypical basic emotions. We tested the sensitivity of a well-established automatic facial coding software program to detect spontaneous emotional reactions in individuals responding to emotional pictures. We compared automatically generated scores for valence and arousal of the Facereader (FR; Noldus Information Technology) with the current psychophysiological gold standard of measuring emotional valence (Facial Electromyography, EMG) and arousal (Skin Conductance, SC). We recorded physiological and behavioral measurements of 43 healthy participants while they looked at pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral scenes. When viewing pleasant pictures, FR Valence and EMG were both comparably sensitive. However, for unpleasant pictures, FR Valence showed an expected negative shift, but the signal differentiated not well between responses to neutral and unpleasant stimuli, that were distinguishable with EMG. Furthermore, FR Arousal values had a stronger correlation with self-reported valence than with arousal while SC was sensitive and specifically associated with self-reported arousal. This is the first study to systematically compare FR measurement of spontaneous emotional reactions to standardized emotional images with established psychophysiological measurement tools. This novel technology has yet to make strides to surpass the sensitivity of established psychophysiological measures.

Startling similarity: Effects of facial self-resemblance and familiarity on the processing of emotional faces,"Finke, J. B.; Larra, M. F.; Merz, M. U.; Schachinger, H.","Facial self-resemblance has been associated with positive emotional evaluations, but this effect may be biased by self-face familiarity. Here we report two experiments utilizing startle modulation to investigate how the processing of facial expressions of emotion is affected by subtle resemblance to the self as well as to familiar faces. Participants of the first experiment (I) (N = 39) were presented with morphed faces showing happy, neutral, and fearful expressions which were manipulated to resemble either their own or unknown faces. At SOAs of either 300 ms or 3500-4500 ms after picture onset, startle responses were elicited by binaural bursts of white noise (50 ms, 105 dB), and recorded at the orbicularis oculi via EMG. Manual reaction time was measured in a simple emotion discrimination paradigm. Pictures preceding noise bursts by short SOA inhibited startle (prepulse inhibition, PPI). Both affective modulation and PPI of startle in response to emotional faces was altered by physical similarity to the self. As indexed both by relative facilitation of startle and faster manual responses, self-resemblance apparently induced deeper processing of facial affect, particularly in happy faces. Experiment II (N = 54) produced similar findings using morphs of famous faces, yet showed no impact of mere familiarity on PPI effects (or response time, either).

In 19 participants, crowds of emotional faces were followed by target faces and a rating task while simultaneous EEG-fMRI were recorded. In addition to conventional analyses, fMRI-informed EEG analyses and fMRI dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were performed. Fearful crowds reduced EEG N170 target face amplitudes and increased responses in a fMRI network comprising insula, amygdala and inferior frontal cortex. Multimodal analyses showed that amygdala response was present approximately 60 ms before the right fusiform gyrus-derived N170. DCM indicated inhibitory connections from amygdala to fusiform gyrus, strengthened when fearful crowds preceded a target face. Results demonstrated the suppressing influence of task-irrelevant fearful crowds on subsequent face processing. The amygdala may be sensitive to task-irrelevant fearful crowds and subsequently strengthen its inhibitory influence on face-responsive fusiform N170 generators.

The effect of inherently threatening contexts on visuocortical engagement to conditioned threat,"Stegmann, Y.; Andreatta, M.; Wieser, M. J.","Fear and anxiety are crucial for adaptive responding in life-threatening situations. Whereas fear is a phasic response to an acute threat accompanied by selective attention, anxiety is characterized by a sustained feeling of apprehension and hypervigilance during situations of potential threat. In the current literature, fear and anxiety are usually considered mutually exclusive, with partially separated neural underpinnings. However, there is accumulating evidence that challenges this distinction between fear and anxiety, and simultaneous activation of fear and anxiety networks has been reported. Therefore, the current study experimentally tested potential interactions between fear and anxiety. Fifty-two healthy participants completed a differential fear conditioning paradigm followed by a test phase in which the conditioned stimuli were presented in front of threatening or neutral contextual images. To capture defense system activation, we recorded subjective (threat, US-expectancy), physiological (skin conductance, heart rate) and visuocortical (steady-state visual evoked potentials) responses to the conditioned stimuli as a function of contextual threat. Results demonstrated successful fear conditioning in all measures. In addition, threat and US-expectancy ratings, cardiac deceleration, and visuocortical activity were enhanced for fear cues presented in threatening compared with neutral contexts. These results are in line with an additive or interactive rather than an exclusive model of fear and anxiety, indicating facilitated defensive behavior to imminent danger in situations of potential threat.",2023,Apr,Psychophysiology,60,4,e14208,36325884.0,10.1111/psyp.14208,,#960,Stegmann 2023,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
No evidence for blocking the return of fear by disrupting reconsolidation prior to extinction learning,"Klucken, T.; Kruse, O.; Schweckendiek, J.; Kuepper, Y.; Mueller, E. M.; Hennig, J.; Stark, R.","Fear extinction is a central model for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Initial research has reported that the single presentation of a conditioned stimulus prior to extinction learning can permanently block the return of fear. However, only few studies have explored this issue and could not always replicate the findings. The present study examined human fear extinction using a four-day design. On the first day, two neutral stimuli were paired with electrical stimulation (UCS), while a third stimulus (CS-) was not. Twenty-four hours later, one conditioned stimulus (CS+rem) and the CS- were reminded once, 10 min before extinction learning, while the other conditioned stimulus (CS+non-rem) was not presented prior to extinction learning. All stimuli were presented during extinction learning and during two re-extinction sessions (24 h and 6-months after extinction learning) without reinforcement. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses and skin conductance responses (SCRs) to both CS+ and the CS- were explored during acquisition, extinction, and in both re-extinction sessions. Regarding SCRs, the results showed that a single presentation of a conditioned stimulus did not block the return of fear during re-extinction: Fear recovery during re-extinction (24 h and 6-months after extinction learning) was observed for both CS+ compared with the CS- with no difference between CS+rem and CS+non-rem. Regarding BOLD-responses, no significant differences between CS+rem and CS+non-rem were found in region of interest (ROI)-analyses (amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex) during extinction learning and both re-extinction sessions. Whole-brain analyses showed increased BOLD-responses to the CS+non-rem as compared to the CS+rem in several regions (e.g., middle frontal gyrus) during extinction learning and re-extinction (24 h after extinction learning). The present findings suggest that the effect of preventing the return of fear by disrupting reconsolidation seems to be a more labile phenomenon than previously assumed.

"Hear it, fear it: Fear generalizes from conditioned pictures to semantically related sounds","Gerdes, A. B. M.; Fraunfelter, L.; Alpers, G.

Previous studies have investigated fear generalization within one sensory modality - mainly within the visual domain. However, a growing body of evidence shows that emotional information is processed in more than one sensory modality. Based on network theories, we expected that fear may also generalize from stimuli in one sensory modality to another. To test our hypothesis, 42 participants underwent a differential conditioning paradigm, during which pictures were either presented with (vCS+) or without (vCS-) an aversive electric stimulus. After the acquisition phase, generalization was tested in the crossmodal group (n = 21) by presenting sounds which were semantically congruent to the visual vCS+ (i.e., the aGS+) or the vCS- (i.e., the aGS-). As a control, the unimodal group (n = 21) saw the pictures again. For the crossmodal group, we could show that US expectancy ratings generalized from conditioned pictures (vCS+) to semantically related sounds (aGS+).

Noradrenergic stimulation increases fear memory expression,"Kausche, F. M.; Zerbes, G.; Kampermann, L.; Muller, J.

Despite the clinical relevance of fear (over)generalization, how the extent of fear generalization is modulated remains not well understood. Based on the known effects of stress on learning and memory, we tested here the impact of major stress mediators, glucocorticoids and noradrenergic arousal, on fear generalization. In a laboratory-based, placebo-controlled, double-blind, between-subject design, 125 healthy participants first underwent a fear conditioning procedure. About 24 h later, participants received orally either a placebo, hydrocortisone, the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine, leading to increased noradrenergic stimulation, or both drugs before a test of fear generalization. Skin conductance responses as well as explicit rating data revealed that yohimbine intake led to enhanced fear memory expression, i.e. an enhanced responding to the CS+ but not to stimuli resembling the CS+. Moreover, neither enhanced safety learning nor a mere enhancement of perceptual discrimination ability could explain this result. In contrast to yohimbine, hydrocortisone had no significant effect on fear memory.

As insulin plays a critical role in stress processes and acts as a memory enhancer, this study aimed to assess the capacity of intranasal insulin to augment fear extinction. A double-blind, placebo-controlled differential fear-conditioning paradigm was conducted in 123 healthy participants (63 females). Pictures of faces with neutral expressions were used as conditioned stimuli and electric shocks as unconditioned stimuli. The paradigm consisted of four phases presented on three consecutive days: acquisition (day 1), extinction (day 2), reinstatement and re-extinction (day 3). A single intranasal dose of insulin (160 IU) or placebo was applied on day 2, 45 min before fear extinction. Skin conductance response (SCR), fear-potentiated startle (FPS) and expectancy ratings were assessed. During extinction, the insulin group (independent of sex) showed a significantly stronger decrease in differential FPS in comparison with the placebo group. Furthermore, a sex-specific effect was found for SCR, with women in the insulin group showing a greater decrease of differential SCR both at early extinction and at late re-extinction.

Previous work investigating fear-conditioning in humans has used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate that activity patterns representing stimuli from an aversively-conditioned category (CS+) are more similar to each other than those of a neutral category (CS-). Here we used fMRI and multiple aversively-conditioned categories to ask whether we would find only similarity increases within the CS+ categories or also similarity increases between the CS+ categories. Using representational similarity analysis, we correlated several models to activity patterns underlying different brain regions and found that, following fear-conditioning, between-category and within-category similarity increased for the CS+ categories in the insula, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and the right temporal pole. When specifically investigating fear-generalization, these between- and within-category effects were detected in the SFG.

Self-compassion buffers the link between self-criticism and depression in trauma-exposed firefighters,"Kaurin, A.; Schonfelder, S.; Wessa, M.","Firefighters are frequently exposed to highly stressful, potentially traumatic events (PTEs). More than 50%, however, show no significant elevation in trauma-related symptomatology (e.g., depression). In the past, self-compassion has been discussed to promote psychological and behavioral flexibility that is vital to a successful adaptation to PTEs. The goal of this study was to understand whether and how self-compassion may alleviate personal suffering in the face of PTEs. We hypothesized that individuals who encounter their profession-related affective experiences with greater self-compassion, show lower levels of depressive symptoms because self-compassion buffers processes that perpetuate negative affectivity in response to PTEs (i.e., self-critical tendencies). Male firefighters (N = 123) completed self-report questionnaires about the severity of current depressive symptoms; prior traumatic, duty-related events; and the self-compassion scale that assesses two distinct factors: self-criticism and self-compassion. A stepwise regression model was employed to examine differential and interactive contributions of self-criticism and self-compassion to symptoms of depression across the cumulative range of exposure to PTEs. Our results indicate that the positive association between self-criticism and depression is buffered by enhanced levels of self-compassion. This moderation, however, only emerged for firefighters with substantial amounts of PTEs experience in the past. The present work provides insight into protective effects of self-compassion in the face of cumulative PTEs. It suggests that, particularly for severely trauma-exposed firefighters, self-compassion may confer resilience, that is, act as a protective factor from the development of depressive symptoms. Findings are discussed in light of counseling implications. (PsycINFO Database Record",2018,Jul,J Couns Psychol,65,4,453-462,29927259.0,10.1037/cou0000275,,#972,Kaurin 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

A retest was performed with 224 of the healthy participants. Furthermore, all participants were tested for orthonasal threshold, identification, and discrimination ability. Significant cultural differences in identification ability were found in 92% of the probes. The 20 probes that could be identified above chance in healthy participants of all countries and that could differentiate between patients and controls were selected for the final retronasal test. This test was well able to differentiate between controls and patients in different countries and showed a good coherence with the orthonasal test (r = 0.80) and a good retest-reliability (r = 0.76). Furthermore, it is age-independent. The strong cultural differences observed in retronasal identification underline the necessity to develop a culturally independent instrument. This retronasal test is easy to apply and can be used across different countries for diagnostics and clinical research.",2014,May,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,271,5,1087-95,23999595.0,10.1007/s00405-013-2684-9,,#973,Croy 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Naps promote flexible memory retrieval in 12-month-old infants,"Konrad, C.; Seehagen, S.; Schneider, S.; Herbert, J. S.","Flexibility in applying existing knowledge to similar cues is a corner stone of memory development in infants. Here, we examine the effect of sleep on the flexibility of memory retrieval using a deferred imitation paradigm. Forty-eight 12-month-old infants were randomly assigned to either a nap or a no-nap demonstration condition (scheduled around their natural daytime sleep schedule) or to a baseline control condition. In the demonstration conditions, infants watched an experimenter perform three target actions on a hand puppet. Immediately afterwards, infants were allowed to practice the target actions three times. In a test session 4-hr later, infants were given the opportunity to reproduce the actions with a novel hand puppet differing in color from the puppet used during the demonstration session. Only infants in the nap-condition performed significantly more target actions than infants in the baseline control condition. Furthermore, they were faster to carry out the first target action than infants in the no-nap condition. We conclude that sleep had a facilitative effect on infants' flexibility of memory retrieval.",2016,Nov,Dev Psychobiol,58,7,866-874,27197794.0,10.1002/dev.21431,,#974,Konrad 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Getting the mouse out of the box: Tool innovation in preschoolers,"Voigt, B.; Pauen, S.; Bechtel-Kuehne, S.","Following the literature, children younger than 8 years rarely innovate a tool. Theories on innovation and comparative research on tool manufacturing suggest that children's performance may depend on the task context. The current study explored whether preschool children's poor performance in past research could be attributed to short time limits and the required manufacturing method. In four experiments, 5-year-olds needed to retrieve a toy from a tube by manufacturing a novel tool and using it successfully. The type of potentially functional materials varied among the experiments. Cumulative innovation rate was analyzed after 1 and 10 min. The 5-year-olds rarely innovated if merely ""reshape"" (modifying the material's shape) was offered as a potentially successful manufacturing method even when they had up to 10 min to complete the task (21%; Experiment 1). The vast majority of 5-year-olds succeeded if multiple manufacturing strategies were functional, but only if children had up to 10 min to complete the task (93%; Experiment 2). The innovation rate remained high if ""detach"" (separating material from a substrate) was not available (76%; Experiment 3) and if ""subtract"" (removing something from a material) was the only functional manufacturing method (71%; Experiment 4). Our findings suggest that even preschool-aged children are ""good innovators"" if (a) they have enough time and (b) manufacturing methods other than reshape can be used to solve the problem. However, they seem to struggle if (a) they have only 1 min to complete the task and (b) solving the task requires them to reshape a material.",2019,Aug,J Exp Child Psychol,184,,65-81,30999156.0,10.1016/j.jecp.2019.03.005,,#975,Voigt 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"""Smile away your cravings"" - Facial feedback modulates cue-induced food cravings","Schmidt, J.; Martin, A.","Food cravings are common experiences that precede dysfunctional eating behaviors, such as overeating and binge eating. These cravings are often related to negative affect, especially in emotional eaters. Recent studies have revived interest in a theory on the implicit modulation of affect: the facial feedback-hypothesis. This theory claims that mimic expressions influence affective experiences. Given the association between negative affect and food craving, facial feedback could provide a means to reduce or prevent food cravings. In an experimental study, using a read aloud task, we examined, whether an implicit modulation of facial muscle activity - zygomatic muscle (smiling: FF+) and corrugator muscle (frowning: FF-) - would alter food cue-induced cravings in healthy young women (n = 60). We further examined, if traits in emotional eating influence the facial feedback-effect. The activation of the zygomatic muscle prevented the occurrence of food cravings after exposure with palatable food cues. Food craving only increased in the FF- group (p = 0.029). The facial feedback effect was especially pronounced in emotional eaters, indicated by a significant moderation (p = 0.041). In participants with high degrees of emotional eating, food craving was reduced in the FF + group and amplified in the FF- group. The results indicate that mimic expressions might influence food cravings on implicit pathways. Existing approaches that target implicit behavior modification via facial feedback may be transferable to eating behavior. These methods could potentially help in altering dysfunctional eating associated with food craving, especially in individuals prone to emotional eating.",2017,Sep 1,Appetite,116,,536-543,28549759.0,10.1016/j.appet.2017.05.037,,#976,Schmidt 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Can't decide how much to EAT? Effort variability for reward is associated with cognitive restraint,"van den Hoek Ostende, M. M.; Neuser, M. P.; Teckentrup, V.; Svaldi, J.; Kroemer, N. B.","Food intake is inherently variable and often characterized by episodical restraint or overeating (uncontrolled eating). Such heightened variability in intake has been associated with higher variability in the brain response to food reward, but it is an open issue whether comparable associations with elevated variability in reward seeking exist. Here, we assessed whether restraint and uncontrolled eating as markers of trait-like variability in eating are associated with higher intra-individual variability in reward seeking as captured by a cost-benefit paradigm. To test this hypothesis, 81 healthy, overnight-fasting participants (M(BMI) = 23.0 kg/m(2) +/- 3.0) completed an effort allocation task (EAT) twice. In the EAT, participants had to exert physical effort to earn monetary and food rewards and indicated levels of wanting through visual analog scales (VAS). As predicted, we found that greater trial-by-trial effort variability was associated with lower scores on cognitive restraint, r(p)(78) = -0.28, p = .011 (controlled for average effort). In line with previous findings, higher wanting variability was associated with higher BMI, r(p)(78) = 0.25, p = .026 (controlled for average effort). Collectively, our results support the idea that higher variability in reward seeking is a potential risk factor for eating beyond homeostatic need. Since associations with variability measures of reward exceeded associations with average reward seeking, our findings may indicate that variability in the representation of the reward value could be a crucial aspect driving fluctuations in food intake.",2021,Apr 1,Appetite,159,,105067,33307115.0,10.1016/j.appet.2020.105067,,#977,vandenHoekOstende 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Lower body weight is associated with less negative emotions in sad autobiographical memories of patients with anorexia nervosa,"Brockmeyer, T.; Grosse Holtforth, M.; Bents, H.; Herzog, W.; Friederich, H. C.","Food restriction and weight-loss have been proposed to represent pathogenic mechanisms of emotion regulation in anorexia nervosa (AN). However, there is a lack of studies empirically examining this hypothesis. Therefore, the present study compared 25 women with AN and 25 healthy control women (HC) regarding spontaneous emotional processing of autobiographic memories. Participants' idiographic memories of sad autobiographic events were analyzed using computerized, quantitative text analysis as an unobtrusive approach of nonreactive assessment. Compared to HC, AN patients retrieved more negative but a comparable number of positive emotions. Moreover, the lesser the body weight in AN patients, the lesser negative emotions they retrieved, irrespective of current levels of depressive symptoms and duration of illness. No such association was found in HC. These preliminary findings are in line with models of AN proposing that food restriction and weight-loss may be negatively reinforced by the alleviation of aversive emotional responses.",2013,Dec 15,Psychiatry Res,210,2,548-52,23850436.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2013.06.024,,#978,Brockmeyer 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Stick with your group: young children's attitudes about group loyalty,"Misch, A.; Over, H.; Carpenter, M.","For adults, loyalty to the group is highly valued, yet little is known about how children evaluate loyalty. We investigated children's attitudes about loyalty in a third-party context. In the first experiment, 4- and 5-year-olds watched a video of two groups competing. Two members of the losing group then spoke. The disloyal individual said she wanted to win and therefore would join the other group. The loyal individual said she also wanted to win but would stay with her group. Children were then asked five forced-choice questions about these two individuals' niceness, trustworthiness, morality, and deservingness of a reward. The 5-year-olds preferred the loyal person across all questions; results for the 4-year-olds were considerably weaker but in the same direction. The second experiment investigated the direction of the effect in 5-year-olds. In this experiment, children answered questions about either a loyal individual, a disloyal individual, or a neutral individual. Children rated both the loyal and neutral individuals more positively than the disloyal individual across a number of measures. Thus, whereas disloyal behavior is evaluated unfavorably by children, loyal behavior is the expected norm. These results suggest that, at least from 5 years of age, children understand that belonging to a group entails certain commitments. This marks an important step in their own ability to negotiate belonging and become trustworthy and reliable members of their social groups.",2014,Oct,J Exp Child Psychol,126,,19-36,24842584.0,10.1016/j.jecp.2014.02.008,,#980,Misch 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Dominance of texture over shape in facial identity processing is modulated by individual abilities,"Itz, M. L.; Golle, J.; Luttmann, S.; Schweinberger, S. R.; Kaufmann, J. M.","For face recognition, observers utilize both shape and texture information. Here, we investigated the relative diagnosticity of shape and texture for delayed matching of familiar and unfamiliar faces (Experiment 1) and identifying familiar and newly learned faces (Experiment 2). Within each familiarity condition, pairs of 3D-captured faces were morphed selectively in either shape or texture in 20% steps, holding the respective other dimension constant. We also assessed participants' individual face-processing skills via the Bielefelder Famous Faces Test (BFFT), the Glasgow Face Matching Test, and the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT). Using multilevel model analyses, we examined probabilities of same versus different responses (Experiment 1) and of original identity versus other/unknown identity responses (Experiment 2). Overall, texture was more diagnostic than shape for both delayed matching and identification, particularly so for familiar faces. On top of these overall effects, above-average BFFT performance was associated with enhanced utilization of texture in both experiments. Furthermore, above-average CFMT performance coincided with slightly reduced texture dominance in the delayed matching task (Experiment 1) and stronger sensitivity to morph-based changes overall, that is irrespective of morph type, in the face identification task (Experiment 2). Our findings (1) show the disproportionate importance of texture information for processing familiar face identity and (2) provide further evidence that familiar and unfamiliar face identity perception are mediated by different underlying processes.",2017,May,Br J Psychol,108,2,369-396,27230305.0,10.1111/bjop.12199,,#981,Itz 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Emotional sounds guide visual attention to emotional pictures: An eye-tracking study with audio-visual stimuli,"Gerdes, A. B. M.; Alpers, G. W.; Braun, H.; Kohler, S.; Nowak, U.; Treiber, L.","For the realm of visual cues, it has been well documented that attention is preferentially oriented toward emotionally relevant cues. Preliminary evidence suggests that emotional cues from other sensory modalities may also steer visual attention toward emotional pictures. However, more research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms that are involved. Therefore, a novel design was used to investigate whether emotional sounds promote attentional orientation toward emotional pictures. To this end, 48 participants viewed pairs of pictures with either neutral or unpleasant content in a free-viewing paradigm. In addition, neutral or unpleasant sounds were presented either on the left-hand or on the right-hand side of the monitor. Eye movements were recorded as an index of visual spatial attention toward the pictures. Most interestingly, position and valence of the sounds independently modulated visual orienting towards unpleasant pictures. For initial capture and sustained attention, orienting towards unpleasant pictures was significantly enhanced when any sound was heard on the same side as the unpleasant picture. In addition, unpleasant sounds (irrespective of the side) boosted leftward bias of initial attention toward emotionally congruent pictures. Taken together, this study clearly shows that emotional auditory cues guide visual spatial allocation of attention specifically to emotionally congruent pictures.

Differential Associations Among PTSD and Complex PTSD Symptoms and Traumatic Experiences and Postmigration Difficulties in a Culturally Diverse Refugee Sample,"Hecker, T.; Huber, S.; Maier, T.; Maercker, A.","Forced migration is one of the major challenges currently facing the international community. Many refugees have been affected by traumatic experiences at home and during their flight, putting them at a heightened risk of developing trauma-related disorders. The new version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) introduced two sibling disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD). So far, little is known about risk and protective factors in refugees that are specifically associated with the disturbances in self-organization (DSO) characteristic of CPTSD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between PTSD and DSO symptoms and traumatic experiences, postmigration difficulties, and social support in a culturally diverse sample of refugees who resettled in Switzerland. A total of 94 refugees (85.1% male; M age = 31.60 years, SD = 10.14, range: 18-61 years) participated in this study. Trained assessors performed either guided questionnaire assessments or structured interviews. In our advice- and help-seeking sample, 32.9% of individuals suffered from PTSD and 21.3% from CPTSD. After controlling for potential gender differences, we found positive associations between PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure, beta = .22, as well as between DSO symptoms and postmigration living difficulties, beta = .42, and lack of social support, beta = .22.

No transfer effect of a fraction number line game on fraction understanding or fraction arithmetic: A randomized controlled trial,"Nuraydin, S.; Stricker, J.; Schneider, M.","Fractions are hard to understand for students. According to Siegler's integrated theory, magnitude understanding is central to numerical development. Whole-number magnitude understanding can be improved by serious games that include practicing mapping numbers onto number lines or similar one-dimensional visuospatial representations. These games were effective even when they did not include direct instruction on whole numbers. Previous studies have also evaluated whether similar number line estimation (NLE) interventions improve fraction learning. We contribute to this literature by evaluating how the catch-the-monster game with fractions affects NLE, magnitude understanding, and arithmetic with fractions in a randomized controlled pretest-intervention-posttest design. The game included NLE with feedback but no direct instruction. A sample of 188 fifth- to eighth-graders participated in a fraction number line game condition, a scaffolded fraction number line games condition, or an active control condition. In fifth- and sixth-graders, participation in the intervention improved the trained measure of fraction understanding (NLE on 0-1 line) but left unchanged two untrained measures of fraction understanding (NLE on 0-5 lines and fraction comparison) and a measure of fraction arithmetic. Seventh- and eighth-graders showed no intervention effects. The lack of transfer in fifth- and sixth-graders indicates that gamified NLE interventions can complement but not replace more direct instruction on fraction concepts and fraction arithmetic.",2022,May,J Exp Child Psychol,217,,105353,35078086.0,10.1016/j.jecp.2021.105353,,#985,Nuraydin 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The Sleeping Infant Brain Anticipates Development,"Friedrich, M.; Wilhelm, I.; Molle, M.; Born, J.; Friederici, A. D.","From the age of 3 months, infants learn relations between objects and co-occurring words [1]. These very first representations of object-word pairings in infant memory are considered as non-symbolic proto-words comprising specific visual-auditory associations that can already be formed in the first months of life [2-5]. Genuine words that refer to semantic long-term memory have not been evidenced prior to 9 months of age [6-9]. Sleep is known to facilitate the reorganization of memories [9-14], but its impact on the perceptual-to-semantic trend in early development is unknown. Here we explored the formation of word meanings in 6- to 8-month-old infants and its reorganization during the course of sleep. Infants were exposed to new words as labels for new object categories. In the memory test about an hour later, generalization to novel category exemplars was tested. In infants who took a short nap during the retention period, a brain response of 3-month-olds [1] was observed, indicating generalizations based on early developing perceptual-associative memory. In those infants who napped longer, a semantic priming effect [15, 16] usually found later in development [17-19] revealed the formation of genuine words. The perceptual-to-semantic shift in memory was related to the duration of sleep stage 2 and to locally increased sleep spindle activity. The finding that, after the massed presentation of several labeled category exemplars, sleep enabled even 6-month-olds to create semantic long-term memory clearly challenges the notion that immature brain structures are responsible for the typically slower lexical development.",2017,Aug 7,Curr Biol,27,15,2374-2380 e3,28756948.0,10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.070,,#987,Friedrich 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Frontal alpha asymmetry in OCD patients and unaffected first-degree relatives,"Grutzmann, R.; Riesel, A.; Klawohn, J.; Heinzel, S.; Kaufmann, C.; Bey, K.; Lennertz, L.; Wagner, M.; Kathmann, N.","Frontal electroencephalographic alpha asymmetry as an indicator of trait approach and trait inhibition systems has previously been studied in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with mixed results. We explored frontal alpha asymmetry as a possible risk factor in OCD by investigating a large sample of OCD patients (n = 113), healthy control participants (n = 113), and unaffected 1st-degree relatives of OCD patients (n = 37). Additionally, the relationship between OCD symptom dimensions and frontal alpha asymmetry was explored. OCD patients and healthy control participants did not differ in alpha asymmetry scores. Hence, the current results do not support the notion that OCD as a diagnostic entity is associated with a shift in frontal cortical activity. Furthermore, alpha asymmetry scores were not statistically related to specific OCD symptom dimensions. Reasons for inconsistent results in OCD are discussed and should be explored in future studies. Compared to OCD patients and healthy control participants, unaffected 1st-degree relatives of OCD patients showed increased left frontal activity. Such asymmetry has previously been found to be associated with positive affect and adaptive emotion regulation under stress. Because stressful life events play an important role in the onset and exacerbation of OCD, increased left frontal activity might serve as a resilience factor in unaffected 1st-degree relatives. Future studies should follow up on these results with longitudinal risk studies and pre- and posttherapy assessments to further explore causality of this putative factor.

Motor skill failure or flow-experience? Functional brain asymmetry and brain connectivity in elite and amateur table tennis players,"Wolf, S.; Brolz, E.; Keune, P. M.; Wesa, B.; Hautzinger, M.; Birbaumer, N.; Strehl, U.","Functional hemispheric asymmetry is assumed to constitute one underlying neurophysiological mechanism of flow-experience and skilled psycho-motor performance in table tennis athletes. We hypothesized that when initiating motor execution during motor imagery, elite table tennis players show higher right- than left-hemispheric temporal activity and stronger right temporal-premotor than left temporal-premotor theta coherence compared to amateurs. We additionally investigated, whether less pronounced left temporal cortical activity is associated with more world rank points and more flow-experience. To this aim, electroencephalographic data were recorded in 14 experts and 15 amateur table tennis players. Subjects watched videos of an opponent serving a ball and were instructed to imagine themselves responding with a specific table tennis stroke. Alpha asymmetry scores were calculated by subtracting left from right hemispheric 8-13 Hz alpha power. 4-7 Hz theta coherence was calculated between temporal (T3/T4) and premotor (Fz) cortex. Experts showed a significantly stronger shift towards lower relative left-temporal brain activity compared to amateurs and a significantly stronger right temporal-premotor coherence than amateurs. The shift towards lower relative left-temporal brain activity in experts was associated with more flow-experience and lower relative left temporal activity was correlated with more world rank points. The present findings suggest that skilled psycho-motor performance in elite table tennis players reflect less desynchronized brain activity at the left hemisphere and more coherent brain activity between fronto-temporal and premotor oscillations at the right hemisphere.

Role of the ventral striatum in developing anorexia nervosa,"Fladung, A. K.; Schulze, U.

In the present study, development of this signal was investigated with the prediction that a characteristic pattern of ventral-striatal signalling will be shown in response to cues associated with food restriction that reflects the evolvement of starvation dependence over time. The signal was assessed in adolescent patients with AN, whose duration of illness was about five times shorter relative to the adult sample. During functional magnetic resonance imaging subjects were required to estimate weights of body images (underweight, normal weight, overweight) and to process each stimulus in a self-referring way. Relative to age-matched, young healthy controls, underweight stimuli were already associated with greater activity of the ventral striatum, and processing of normal-weight stimuli elicited already reduced signalling. Subjective preferences showed exactly the same pattern of results. Relative to adult AN, the present data reveal a developing dysfunctional signal that, if untreated, will essentially contribute to the maintenance of AN.

The Design Matters: How to Detect Neural Correlates of Baby Body Odors,"Schafer, L.; Hummel, T.; Croy, I.","Functional magnetic resonance imaging of body odors is challenging due to methodological obstacles of odor presentation in the scanner and low intensity of body odors.

Evidence on central processing of baby body odors has been scarce but might be important in order to detect neural correlates of bonding in mothers. A suitable paradigm for investigating perception of baby body odors has still to be established. We compared neural responses to baby body odors in a new to a conventional block design in a sample of ten normosmic mothers. For the new short design, 6 s of continuous odor presentation were followed by 19 s baseline and 13 repetitions were performed. For the conventional long design, 15 s of pulsed odor presentation were followed by 30 s of baseline and eight repetitions were performed. Neural responses were observed in brain structures related to basal and higher-order olfactory processing, such as insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala. Neural responses following the short design were significantly higher in comparison to the long design. This effect was based on higher number of repetitions but affected olfactory areas differently. The BOLD signal in the primary olfactory structures was enhanced by short and continuous stimulation, secondary structures did profit from longer stimulations with many repetitions.

Only few studies, however, have empirically tested this theoretical model thus far. The present study aimed at investigating (1) the central assumptions of this model, i.e. that Accuracy, Sensibility and Awareness are distinguishable facets of interoception and that Interoceptive Accuracy is the basic level of interoception, and (2) whether cardiovascular activation (as indexed by heart rate) is differentially related to the three facets of interoception. Analyses were conducted on a total sample of N=159 healthy participants (118 female [74.2%]; mean age=23.9years, SD=3.3, range=19-45) who performed either the heartbeat tracking task, the heartbeat discrimination task or both. The results suggest that Accuracy, Sensibility and Awareness are empirically distinct facets of interoception, showing no correlation when based on heartbeat tracking, but moderate correlations when based on heartbeat discrimination. The assumption that Interoceptive Accuracy is the basic level of interoception could only be partially confirmed. Instead, we conclude that the level of objective physiological states should be considered as the most basic level of interoceptive signal processing.",2016,Nov,Int J Psychophysiol,109,,71-80,27702644.0,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2016.09.019,,#994,Forkmann 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"What's in a gaze, what's in a face?: The direct gaze effect can be modulated by emotion expression","Pittig, R.; van der Wel, Rprd; Welsh, T. N.; Bockler, A.","Gaze direction and emotion expression are salient facial features that facilitate social interactions. Previous studies addressed how gaze direction influences the evaluation and recognition of emotion expressions, but few have tested how emotion expression influences attentional processing of direct versus averted gaze faces. The present study examined whether the prioritization of direct gaze (toward the observer) relative to averted gaze (away from the observer) is modulated by the emotional expression of the observed face. Participants identified targets presented on the forehead of one of four faces in a 2 x 2 design (gaze direction: direct/averted; motion: sudden/static). Emotion expressions of the faces (neutral, angry, fearful, happy, disgusted) differed across participants. Direct gaze effects emerged-response times were shorter for targets on direct gaze than on averted gaze faces. This direct gaze effect was enhanced in angry faces (approach-oriented) and reduced in fearful faces (avoidance-oriented). ""Weaker"" approach- and avoidance-oriented expressions (happy and disgusted) did not modulate the direct gaze effect. These findings suggest that the context of facial emotion expressions influences attentional processing.

Intelligence is associated with the modular structure of intrinsic brain networks,"Hilger, K.; Ekman, M.; Fiebach, C. J.; Basten, U.","General intelligence is a psychological construct that captures in a single metric the overall level of behavioural and cognitive performance in an individual. While previous research has attempted to localise intelligence in circumscribed brain regions, more recent work focuses on functional interactions between regions. However, even though brain networks are characterised by substantial modularity, it is unclear whether and how the brain's modular organisation is associated with general intelligence. Modelling subject-specific brain network graphs from functional MRI resting-state data (N = 309), we found that intelligence was not associated with global modularity features (e.g., number or size of modules) or the whole-brain proportions of different node types (e.g., connector hubs or provincial hubs). In contrast, we observed characteristic associations between intelligence and node-specific measures of within- and between-module connectivity, particularly in frontal and parietal brain regions that have previously been linked to intelligence. We propose that the connectivity profile of these regions may shape intelligence-relevant aspects of information processing. Our data demonstrate that not only region-specific differences in brain structure and function, but also the network-topological embedding of fronto-parietal as well as other cortical and subcortical brain regions is related to individual differences in higher cognitive abilities, i.e., intelligence.",2017,Nov 22,Sci Rep,7,1,16088,29167455.0,10.1038/s41598-017-15795-7,,#997,Hilger 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Individual patterns of visual exploration predict the extent of fear generalization in humans,"Reutter, M.; Gamer, M.","Generalization of fear is considered an important mechanism contributing to the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Although previous studies have identified the importance of stimulus discrimination for fear generalization, it is still unclear to what degree overt attention to relevant stimulus features might mediate its magnitude. To test the prediction that visual preferences for distinguishing stimulus aspects are associated with reduced fear generalization, we developed a set of facial stimuli that was meticulously manipulated such that pairs of faces could either be distinguished by looking into the eyes or into the region around mouth and nose, respectively. These pairs were then employed as CS + and CS- in a differential fear conditioning paradigm followed by a generalization test with morphs in steps of 20%. Shock expectancy ratings indicated a moderately curved fear generalization gradient that is typical for healthy samples, but its shape was altered depending on individual attentional deployment: Particpants who dwelled on the distinguishing facial features faster and for longer periods of time exhibited less fear generalization. Although both pupil and heart rate responses also showed a generalization gradient, with pupil diameter and heart rate deceleration increasing as a function of threat, these responses were not significantly related to visual exploration. In total, the current results indicate that the extent of explicit fear generalization depends on individual patterns of attentional deployment. Future studies evaluating the efficacy of perceptual trainings that aim to augment stimulus discriminability in order to reduce (over)generalization seem desirable.

While genetic association studies have proposed several candidate ""memory genes,"" these currently explain only a minor fraction of the phenotypic variance. Here, we performed genome-wide screening on 13 episodic and working memory phenotypes in 1318 participants of the Berlin Aging Study II aged 60 years or older. The analyses highlight a number of novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with memory performance, including one located in a putative regulatory region of microRNA (miRNA) hsa-mir-138-5p (rs9882688, P-value = 7.8 x 10(-9)). Expression quantitative trait locus analyses on next-generation RNA-sequencing data revealed that rs9882688 genotypes show a significant correlation with the expression levels of this miRNA in 309 human lymphoblastoid cell lines (P-value = 5 x 10(-4)). In silico modeling of other top-ranking GWAS signals identified an additional memory-associated SNP in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of DCP1B, a gene encoding a core component of the mRNA decapping complex in humans, predicted to interfere with hsa-mir-138-5p binding. This prediction was confirmed in vitro by luciferase assays showing differential binding of hsa-mir-138-5p to 3' UTR reporter constructs in two human cell lines (HEK293: P-value = 0.0470; SH-SY5Y: P-value = 0.0866). Finally, expression profiling of hsa-mir-138-5p and DCP1B mRNA in human post-mortem brain tissue revealed that both molecules are expressed simultaneously in frontal cortex and hippocampus, suggesting that the proposed interaction between hsa-mir-138-5p and DCP1B may also take place in vivo.

Afterwards, infants were exposed to a novel forth hand puppet that combined some of the features from the previously encountered puppets. Only those infants who took a nap after learning produced a significantly higher number of target actions than infants in the baseline control condition who had not seen any demonstrations of target actions.

Mental health stigma and professional help-seeking attitudes a comparison between Cuba and Germany,"Nohr, L.; Lorenzo Ruiz, A.; Sandoval Ferrer, J.

To conceive cultural determinants of help-seeking is crucial to reduce personal and social costs of (untreated) mental disorders. The current study investigates mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes in a Cuban (n = 195) and a German (n = 165) sample. In a questionnaire survey we asked for attitudes towards mental illness and professional help-seeking in the general Cuban and German populations. The cultural context was associated with mental health stigma and professional help-seeking attitudes. Interestingly, Cuban participants reported stronger mental health stigma and more willingness to seek help. In multiple hierarchical regression analyses, community attitudes towards the mentally ill significantly predicted help-seeking attitudes, especially in the Cuban sample. Only in the German sample, more negative individual beliefs about mental illness predicted more self-stigma on help-seeking. Beyond that, cultural context moderated the association between mental health stigma and help-seeking attitudes with a stronger association between the measures in the German sample. However, gender did not predict help-seeking attitudes and self-stigma on help-seeking and no interactions between community attitudes, cultural context, and gender were found in the prediction of help-seeking attitudes. Similarities and differences between the samples are discussed in the light of the cultural contexts and peculiarities of the current samples.

Memory for nonadjacent dependencies in the first year of life and its relation to sleep,"Friedrich, M.; Molle, M.; Born, J.; Friederici, A.

Immediate learning of nonadjacent dependencies has been observed in very young infants, but their memory of such dependencies has remained unexplored. Here we used event-related potentials to investigate whether 6- to 8-month-olds retain nonadjacent dependencies and if sleep after learning affects this memory. Infants were familiarised with two rule-based morphosyntactic dependencies, presented in sentences of an unknown language. Brain responses after a retention period reveal memory of the nonadjacent dependencies, independent of whether infants napped or stayed awake. Napping, however, altered a specific processing stage, suggesting that memory evolves during sleep. Infants with high left frontal spindle activity show an additional brain response indicating memory of individual speech phrases. Results imply that infants as young as 6 months are equipped with memory mechanisms relevant to grammar learning. They also suggest that during sleep, consolidation of highly specific information can co-occur with changes in the nature of generalised memory.",2022,Dec 22,Nat Commun,13,1,7896,36550131.0,10.1038/s41467-022-35558-x,,#1004,Friedrich 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

One-dimensionality was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (study 2, n=363). Convergent validity was tested with a previous continuum beliefs scale, essentialist beliefs, and stigmatization (study 2), while self-reported psychotic experiences (i.e. frequency and conviction) served to test discriminant validity (study 3, n=229). A nine item questionnaire that assesses continuum beliefs about schizophrenia symptoms showed acceptable to good psychometric values, high correlations with a previous continuum beliefs scale and small correlations with essentialist beliefs, stereotypes, and desired social distance. No correlations with psychotic experiences were found. Thus, continuum beliefs can be considered a valid construct. The construed CBQ-R asks about symptoms rather than the abstract category ""schizophrenia"", which may increase understandability of the scale.

A New Measure of Hallucinatory States and a Discussion of REM Sleep Dreaming as a Virtual Laboratory for the Rehearsal of Embodied Cognition,"Speth, C.; Speth, J.","Hallucinatory states are experienced not only in connection with drugs and psychopathologies but occur naturally and spontaneously across the human circadian cycle: Our nightly dreams bring multimodal experiences in the absence of adequate external stimuli. The current study proposes a new, tighter measure of these hallucinatory states: Sleep onset, REM sleep, and non-REM sleep are shown to differ with regard to (a) motor imagery indicating interactions with a rich imaginative world, and (b) cognitive agency that could enable sleepers to recognize their hallucinatory state. Mentation reports from the different states were analysed quantitatively with regard to two grammatical-semantic constructs, motor agency and cognitive agency. The present results support earlier physiological and psychological evidence in revealing a decline in cognitive functions and an increase in simulated interactions with a hallucinatory world, en route to normal REM sleep. This leads us to introduce the hypothesis that REM sleep, which exhibits remarkably high levels of (simulated) sensorimotor processes, may have evolved to serve as a virtual laboratory for the development and rehearsal of embodied cognition.

This study used transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the causal role of prefrontal asymmetries in the processing of emotional stimuli. To experimentally induce hemispheric asymmetries, 21 healthy volunteers underwent two separate sessions of inhibitory continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to the left versus right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Each stimulation was followed by magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of event-related fields elicited by visually presented emotional words in a silent reading task and a subsequent behavioral emotion categorization task. The asymmetry manipulation influenced valence processing of words in early, mid-latency and late time intervals in right occipitotemporal and parietal brain regions. Left-sided cTBS (inducing right-hemispheric dominance) consistently resulted in enhanced brain responses to negative words, while right-sided cTBS (inducing left-hemispheric dominance) enhanced responses to positive words. On a behavioral level, right-hemispheric dominance resulted in more categorization matches of negative compared to positive words, while left-hemispheric dominance resulted in reverse effects.

"Negative reactivity in toddlers born prematurely: indirect and moderated pathways considering self-regulation, neonatal distress and parenting stress","Voigt, B.; Brandl, A.; Pietz, J.; Pauen, S.; Kliegel, M.; Reuner, G.","High negative reactivity in early childhood interferes with later academic and behavioral adjustment. Thus, investigating the origins of high negative affectivity in early childhood is of high relevance for understanding emotional morbidity after preterm birth. The present work explored (1) direct prematurity-related consequences for negative reactivity, (2) self-regulatory deficits as a mechanism indirectly relating prematurity to negative affectivity and (3) the implications of the interplay between procedural distress in the neonatal period and parenting stress for preterm children's negative reactivity. The sample was comprised of 146 preterm children (very vs. moderately to late preterm) and 86 healthy full-term children, both free of major neurological impairment. Assessment involved negative affect and parenting stress (parent-report; 12, 24 months corrected age, CA), effortful control (behavioral battery, parent report; 24 months CA) and the number of potentially distressing neonatal intensive care procedures as well as severity of illness during the neonatal period (retrospective chart review). There was no direct link from prematurity to a disposition for high negative reactivity in early childhood nor was prematurity indirectly associated with higher negative reactivity through lower levels of effortful control. The relation between neonatal pain and distress and negative affectivity depended on the level of parenting stress with low parenting stress at the end of the first year of children's life buffering the negative influence of neonatal distress.

Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation modulates spatial memory in young healthy adults,"Hilliard, D.; Passow, S.; Thurm, F.; Schuck, N. W.; Garthe, A.; Kempermann, G.; Li, S. C.","Hippocampal and striatal circuits play important roles in spatial navigation. These regions integrate environmental information and receive intrinsic afferent inputs from the vestibular system. Past research indicates that galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is a non-invasive technique that modulates hippocampal and striatal activities. There are also evidences for enhanced motor and cognitive functions through GVS. This study extends previous research to investigate whether noisy GVS may improve hippocampal- and striatal-associated aspects of spatial navigation performance. Using a virtual navigation task, we examined effects of noisy GVS on spatial learning and memory. To probe the participants' sensitivity to hippocampal- or striatal-associated spatial information, we either enlarged the virtual environment's boundary or replaced an intra-environmental location cue, respectively. Noisy GVS or sham stimulation was applied online during the learning phase in a within-subject crossover design. The results showed that noisy GVS enhanced spatial learning and the sensitivity foremost to hippocampal-dependent spatial information both in males and females. Individual differences in spatial working memory capacity moderated the effects of GVS, with individuals with lower capacity benefitting more from the stimulation. Furthermore, sex-related differences in GVS effects on the two forms of spatial representations may reflect differences between males and females in preferred spatial strategies.",2019,Jun 27,Sci Rep,9,1,9310,31249334.0,10.1038/s41598-019-45757-0,,#1017,Hilliard 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Fear Extinction Recall Modulates Human Frontomedial Theta and Amygdala Activity,"Sperl, M. F. J.; Panitz, C.; Rosso, I. M.; Dillon, D. G.; Kumar, P.; Hermann, A.; Whitton, A. E.; Hermann, C.; Pizzagalli, D. A.; Mueller, E. M.","Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies, as well as animal studies, indicate that the amygdala and frontomedial brain regions are critically involved in conditioned fear and that frontomedial oscillations in the theta range (4-8 Hz) may support communication between these brain regions. However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS-E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS-N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS-) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.",2019,Feb 1,Cereb Cortex,29,2,701-715,29373635.0,10.1093/cercor/bhx353,,#1019,Sperl 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Subjective reward value of visual sexual stimuli is coded in human striatum and orbitofrontal cortex,"Klein, S.; Kruse, O.; Markert, C.; Tapia Leon, I.; Strahler, J.; Stark, R.","Human neuroimaging research suggests the existence of one core network for the subjective valuation of rewards, including the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. However, there is little research on the neural representation of subjective reward values of visual sexual stimuli (VSS) and on the role of these subjective valuations in the development of related addictive behaviors. Here, we investigate how neural reactivity to VSS is connected to individual preference using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During the fMRI scan, 72 men viewed different VSS film clips. Ratings regarding valence and sexual arousal were collected and used as parametric modulators in the fMRI analysis. Subjects also filled out questionnaires on self-reported symptoms of problematic pornography use (PPU). Firstly, we found that neural reactivity towards VSS clips in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex was positively correlated with individual ratings of the respective VSS in all subjects. Second, the strength of the association between neural activity and sexual arousal ratings was positively correlated with self-reported symptoms of PPU. The first result suggests a precise appraisal of VSS according to individual preferences in established reward valuation regions. Secondly, stronger neural differentiation based on preference in participants with more PPU symptoms indicates an increased importance of VSS/preference fit in these individuals. This heightened correspondence between individual liking and neural activity may facilitate PPU development by increased signaling of incentive salience, thus boosting motivation to seek out and respond to these preferred stimuli.",2020,Sep 1,Behav Brain Res,393,,112792,32598998.0,10.1016/j.bbr.2020.112792,,#1020,Klein 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
The neural representation of an individualized relational affective space,"Levine, S. M.; Wackerle, A.; Rupprecht, R.; Schwarzbach, J. V.","Humans experience emotions every day. Traditionally, psychology has described emotions through discrete labels (e.g. happy, afraid) or standardized affective dimensions (e.g. valence, arousal), and neuroscience has more recently sought the neurobiological basis of emotions via functional neuroimaging. However, by treating emotions similarly among everyone, we neglect that emotions are individualized; thus the overall relational structure of an individual's emotion information may be vital in understanding how the brain represents emotions. Combining behavioral and functional MRI experiments with similarity analyses, we demonstrate that neural activity patterns in the left insula correspond to the multi-dimensional arrangement of individuals' affective spaces, despite interindividual differences, better than to a group-averaged model of affective space, a standardized valence-arousal space, a semantic category space, and a visual similarity space. This finding suggests that the insula may underlie individual-level affective information processing that is specific to one's own affective states, which offers new opportunities for functional neuroimaging to inform clinical approaches of disorders involving emotion dysregulation.",2018,Nov,Neuropsychologia,120,,35-42,30321612.0,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.10.008,,#1021,Levine 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Flexibility of error-monitoring in obsessive-compulsive disorder under speed and accuracy instructions,"Riesel, A.; Kathmann, N.; Klawohn, J.","Hyperactive error monitoring is a robust neurocognitive characteristic in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, relatively little is known about the flexibility and potential moderators of error monitoring in OCD. The current study investigates error monitoring in 30 healthy participants and 28 patients with OCD using a flanker task in 2 conditions either emphasizing speed or accuracy. Results indicate that no group difference is observable in error-related negativity (ERN) under the accuracy-focused condition. Both groups show an ERN attenuation in the speed condition; however, this reduction is larger in healthy controls leading to pronounced group differences in the speed-focused condition. Similarly, receiver operating characteristic analyses yield an area under the curve (AUC) of .62 in the accuracy-focused condition, whereas under speed instruction an AUC of .85 suggests a marked increase in classification accuracy. Behavioral results and results from a drift-diffusion model of decision making indicate a more cautious response strategy and less adaptability to experimental manipulations in OCD. Overall, results suggest that the observed increases in error-related neural activity in OCD might stem from a reduced flexibility and diminished ability to disengage from an accuracy-oriented, error-avoidant response style. Further, the present results suggest that emphasizing speed in experimental instructions may lead to a better neural differentiation between patients with OCD and healthy controls which has important implications for the use of the ERN as a risk indicator.

Hyperactive performance monitoring as a transdiagnostic marker: Results from health anxiety in comparison to obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Riesel, A.; Goldhahn, S.; Kathmann, N.","Hyperactive error-related brain activity has been found in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized and social anxiety as well as depression and has been proposed as a transdiagnostic marker. The specific phenotype to which it is related is still debated and anxious apprehension, threat sensitivity and checking have been proposed as promising candidates. To validate the idea that hyperactive performance monitoring is shared by anxiety and anxiety-related disorders and to refine our knowledge about its specificity, data from further anxiety and anxiety-related disorders are required. We examined performance monitoring in 24 participants with health anxiety and 24 healthy participants. Further, we compared results to performance monitoring data from 24 patients with OCD taken from a previously published study (Riesel et al., 2014). The three groups were matched with regard to age, gender and level of education. The error-related and correct-related negativity (ERN, CRN) derived during a flanker task served as neural indicators of performance monitoring. Participants with health anxiety showed enhanced ERN amplitudes compared to healthy controls and did not differ from OCD patients in ERN. The Health anxiety and healthy control group did not differ in CRN amplitudes, while OCD patients showed enhanced CRN amplitudes. The results suggest that health anxiety is characterized by hyperactive error-monitoring that seems to represent a common information processing dysfunction in health anxiety and OCD. This validates the idea that hyperactive error-monitoring cuts across diagnoses and seems to be a transdiagnostic trait shared by individuals that are highly sensitive to the commission of errors.",2017,Feb,Neuropsychologia,96,,1-8,28041946.0,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2016.12.029,,#1023,Riesel 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Suggested deafness during hypnosis and simulation of hypnosis compared to a distraction and control condition: A study on subjective experience and cortical brain responses,"Franz, M.; Schmidt, B.; Hecht, H.; Naumann, E.; Miltner, W. H. R.","Hypnosis is a powerful tool to affect the processing and perception of stimuli. Here, we investigated the effects of hypnosis on the processing of auditory stimuli, the time course of event-related-potentials (ERP; N1 and P3b amplitudes) and the activity of cortical sources of the P3b component. Forty-eight participants completed an auditory oddball paradigm composed of standard, distractor, and target stimuli during a hypnosis (HYP), a simulation of hypnosis (SIM), a distraction (DIS), and a control (CON) condition. During HYP, participants were suggested that an earplug would obstruct the perception of tones and during SIM they should pretend being hypnotized and obstructed to hear the tones. During DIS, participants' attention was withdrawn from the tones by focusing participants' attention onto a film. In each condition, subjects were asked to press a key whenever a target stimulus was presented. Behavioral data show that target hit rates and response time became significantly reduced during HYP and SIM and loudness ratings of tones were only reduced during HYP. Distraction from stimuli by the film was less effective in reducing target hit rate and tone loudness. Although, the N1 amplitude was not affected by the experimental conditions, the P3b amplitude was significantly reduced in HYP and SIM compared to CON and DIS. In addition, source localization results indicate that only a small number of neural sources organize the differences of tone processing between the control condition and the distraction, hypnosis, and simulation of hypnosis conditions. These sources belong to brain areas that control the focus of attention, the discrimination of auditory stimuli, and the organization of behavioral responses to targets. Our data confirm that deafness suggestions significantly change auditory processing and perception but complete deafness is hard to achieve during HYP. Therefore, the term 'deafness' may be misleading and should better be replaced by 'hypoacusis'.",2020,2020/10/29,PLOS ONE,15,10,e0240832,33119665.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0240832,,#1024,Franz 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Brain activation during social cognition predicts everyday perspective-taking: A combined fMRI and ecological momentary assessment study of the social brain,"Hildebrandt, M. K.; Jauk, E.; Lehmann, K.; Maliske, L.; Kanske, P.","Identifying distinct neural networks underlying social affect (empathy, compassion) and social cognition (Theory of Mind) has advanced our understanding of social interactions. However, little is known about the relation of activation in these networks to psychological experience in daily life. This study (N = 122) examined the ecological validity of neural activation patterns induced by a laboratory paradigm of social affect and cognition with respect to social interactions in everyday life. We used the EmpaToM task, a naturalistic video-based paradigm for the assessment of empathy, compassion, and Theory of Mind, and combined it with a subsequent 14-day ecological momentary assessment protocol on social interactions. Everyday social affect was predicted by social affect experienced during the EmpaToM task, but not by related neural activation in regions of interest from the social affect network. In contrast, everyday social cognition was predicted by neural activation differences in the medial prefrontal cortex - a region of interest from the social cognition network - but not by social cognition performance in the EmpaToM task. The relationship between medial prefrontal cortex activation and everyday social cognition was stronger for spontaneous rather than deliberate perspective taking during the EmpaToM task, pointing to a distinction between propensity and capacity in social cognition. Finally, this neural indicator of Theory of Mind explained variance in everyday social cognition to a similar extent as an established self-report scale.

Investigating individual stress reactivity: High hair cortisol predicts lower acute stress responses,"Sandner, M.; Lois, G.; Streit, F.; Zeier, P.; Kirsch, P.; Wust, S.; Wessa, M.","Identifying individual differences in stress reactivity is of particular interest in the context of stress-related disorders and resilience. Previous studies already identified several factors mediating the individual stress response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). However, the impact of long-term HPA axis activity on acute stress reactivity remains inconclusive. To investigate associations between long-term HPA axis variation and individual acute stress reactivity, we tested 40 healthy volunteers for affective, endocrine, physiological, and neural reactions to a modified, compact version of the established in-MR stress paradigm ScanSTRESS (ScanSTRESS-C). Hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) served as an integrative marker of long-term HPA axis activity. First, the ScanSTRESS-C version proved to be valid in evoking a subjective, endocrine, physiological, and neural stress response with enhanced self-reported negative affect and cortisol levels, increased heart rate as well as increased activation in the anterior insula and the dorso-anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Second and interestingly, results indicated a lower neuroendocrine stress response in individuals with higher HCC: HCC was negatively correlated with the area under the curve (respect to increase; AUCi) of saliva cortisol and with a stress-related increase in dACC activity. The present study explicitly targeted the relationship between HCC and acute stress reactivity on multiple response levels, i.e. subjective, endocrine and neural stress responses.

Positive facial affect - an fMRI study on the involvement of insula and amygdala,"Pohl, A.; Anders, S.; Schulte-Ruther, M.; Mathiak, K.; Kircher, T.","Imitation of facial expressions engages the putative human mirror neuron system as well as the insula and the amygdala as part of the limbic system. The specific function of the latter two regions during emotional actions is still under debate. The current study investigated brain responses during imitation of positive in comparison to non-emotional facial expressions. Differences in brain activation of the amygdala and insula were additionally examined during observation and execution of facial expressions. Participants imitated, executed and observed happy and non-emotional facial expressions, as well as neutral faces. During imitation, higher right hemispheric activation emerged in the happy compared to the non-emotional condition in the right anterior insula and the right amygdala, in addition to the pre-supplementary motor area, middle temporal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that the right insula was more strongly recruited by (i) imitation and execution than by observation of facial expressions, that (ii) the insula was significantly stronger activated by happy than by non-emotional facial expressions during observation and imitation and that (iii) the activation differences in the right amygdala between happy and non-emotional facial expressions were increased during imitation and execution, in comparison to sole observation. We suggest that the insula and the amygdala contribute specifically to the happy emotional connotation of the facial expressions depending on the task. The pattern of the insula activity might reflect increased bodily awareness during active execution compared to passive observation and during visual processing of the happy compared to non-emotional facial expressions. The activation specific for the happy facial expression of the amygdala during motor tasks, but not in the observation condition, might reflect increased autonomic activity or feedback from facial muscles to the amygdala.",2013,2013/08/21,PLOS ONE,8,8,e69886,23990890.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0069886,,#1028,Pohl 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Studies show evidence for the benefits of individualized music. However, the immediate reactions to individualized music have not yet been adequately investigated. AIM: The research objective of the study was the investigation of the immediate effects of an individualized music intervention in a nursing home using a newly developed systematic behavioral observation rating scale. METHODS: In 153 behavioral observations of 20 PwD, 32 different experiences and behaviors pertaining to 11 categories such as emotional and motor changes which indicate immediate reactions to listening to music were rated. RESULTS: Participants showed significantly more positive reactions (e. g. joy or relaxation) and less negative reactions immediately after listening to the music compared to before. Moreover, in the course of listening to music, participants showed significantly more positive reactions, most often smiles, movements to music, attentive listening, relaxation and general vigilance / interest / social contact.

Importantly, the blue light condition reduced and the red light condition increased pain intensity and unpleasantness, both compared to the control condition. The control manipulation influenced the sense of agency, but did not influence pain ratings.

Decision-making and inhibitory control after smoking-related priming in nicotine dependent smokers and never-smokers,"Kraplin, A.; Scherbaum, S.; Buhringer, G.; Goschke, T.","Impaired decision-making and inhibitory control are important characteristics of nicotine dependence (ND). We aimed to test 1) the effects of smoking-related priming cues on subsequent decision-making and inhibitory control in ND and 2) how these priming effects are related to valence ratings, nicotine deprivation and craving. A sample of 27 smokers with ND according to DSM-IV and a control group of 33 never-smokers performed an intertemporal choice task and a go/no-go task. Before each trial of the tasks, a priming cue appeared that was either smoking-related or neutral. Valence ratings, nicotine deprivation and craving were assessed with self-reports. After smoking-related compared to neutral primes, the ND group exhibited increased delay discounting (beta = 0.07, 95% confidence-interval (CI): 0.01-0.14) and shorter go reaction times (beta = -0.13, CI: -0.32 to -0.01) compared to the never-smoker group. The speed-up in go trials after smoking-related compared to neutral cues was significantly related to more pleasant valence ratings (beta = 0.07, CI:0.01-0.13), a longer time since last cigarette (beta = -0.17, CI:-0.30 to -0.03), and increased craving (beta = -0.19, CI: -0.33 to -0.06) within the ND group. We found evidence for small group effects indicating that individuals with ND compared to never-smokers decide more dysfunctional and react faster after smoking-related compared to neutral cues. Faster reactions after smoking-related cues within the ND group, especially in states of increased nicotine deprivation and craving, without more errors could be explained by an increased attentional focus.

Learning mechanisms underlying threat absence and threat relief: Influences of trait anxiety,"Andreatta, M.; Pauli, P.","Impaired safety learning has been proposed asa risk factor for anxiety disorders, but safety can be indicated by either threat absence or threat termination (i.e., relief). Here, we investigated the role of trait anxiety for both kinds of safety learning. Ninety-one participants underwent an acquisition phase during which one shape ((threat)CS) predicted a painful electric shock (unconditioned stimulus, US), one shape ((relief)CS) followed the US, and one shape ((absence)CS) became never associated with the US. In a following extinction phase, the three cues were presented again plus a control shape ((control)CS). We found successful threat conditioning as (threat)CS was rated as more aversive (negative, arousing, anxiogenic and associated with US) than the other cues, and it elicited startle potentiation as well asa larger skin conductance response (SCR). Safety cues were rated equally positive and (non-)anxiogenic, but still lower than (control)CS, whereas physiologically (relief)CS elicited stronger appetitive responses (startle attenuation and low SCR) than (absence)CS. Interestingly, an increase in trait anxiety was associated with a decrease in the differences between (absence)CS and (threat)CS responses reflected in contingency ratings during extinction as well as stronger fear-startle responses to (absence)CS. In sum, physiological responses but not ratings triggered by a relief signal compared to a threat-absence signal, indicated that the former is more appetitive than the latter.

Effect of Developmentally Adapted Cognitive Processing Therapy for Youth With Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder After Childhood Sexual and Physical Abuse: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Rosner, R.; Rimane, E.; Frick, U.; Gutermann, J.; Hagl, M.; Renneberg, B.; Schreiber, F.; Vogel, A.; Steil, R.","IMPORTANCE: Despite the high prevalence, evidence-based treatments for abuse-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adolescents have rarely been studied. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether developmentally adapted cognitive processing therapy (D-CPT) is more effective than a wait-list condition with treatment advice (WL/TA) among adolescents with PTSD related to childhood abuse. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This rater-blinded, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (stratified by center) enrolled treatment-seeking adolescents and young adults (aged 14-21 years) with childhood abuse-related PTSD at 3 university outpatient clinics in Germany from July 2013 to June 2015, with the last follow-up interview conducted by May 2016. Of 194 patients, 88 were eligible for randomization. INTERVENTIONS: Participants received D-CPT or WL/TA. Cognitive processing therapy was enhanced by a motivational and alliance-building phase, by including emotion regulation and consideration of typical developmental tasks, and by higher session frequency in the trauma-focused core CPT phase. In WL/TA, participants received treatment advice with respective recommendations of clinicians and were offered D-CPT after 7 months. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All outcomes were assessed before treatment (baseline), approximately 8 weeks after the start of treatment, after the end of treatment (posttreatment), and at the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, was assessed in clinical interview (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents for DSM-IV [CAPS-CA]). Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD severity, depression, borderline symptoms, behavior problems, and dissociation. RESULTS: The 88 participants (75 [85%] female) had a mean age of 18.1 years (95% CI, 17.6-18.6 years). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the 44 participants receiving D-CPT (39 [89%] female) demonstrated greater improvement than the 44 WL/TA participants (36 [82%] female) in terms of PTSD severity (mean CAPS-CA scores, 24.7 [95% CI, 16.6-32.7] vs 47.5 [95% CI, 37.9-57.1]; Hedges g = 0.90). This difference was maintained through the follow-up (mean CAPS-CA scores, 25.9 [95% CI, 16.2-35.6] vs 47.3 [95% CI, 37.8-56.8]; Hedges g = 0.80). Treatment success was greatest during the trauma-focused core phase. The D-CPT participants also showed greater and stable improvement in all secondary outcomes, with between-groups effect sizes ranging from 0.65 to 1.08 at the posttreatment assessment (eg, for borderline symptoms, 14.1 [95% CI, 8.0-20.2] vs 32.0 [95% CI, 23.8-40.2]; Hedges g = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Adolescents and young adults with abuse-related PTSD benefited more from D-CPT than from WL/TA.

In addition, univariate analysis was conducted to predict reduction of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score by pretreatment gray matter volumes and to investigate ECT-related structural changes. RESULTS: One participant in the ECT sample was excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 participants (27 men and 40 women; mean [SD] age, 43.7 [10.6] years). The binary pattern classification yielded a successful prediction of ECT response, with accuracy rates of 78.3% (18 of 23 patients in the ECT sample) and sensitivity rates of 100% (13 of 13 who responded to ECT). Furthermore, a support vector regression yielded a significant prediction of relative reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. The principal findings of the univariate model indicated a positive association between pretreatment subgenual cingulate volume and individual ECT response (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x = 8, y = 21, z = -18; Z score, 4.00; P < .001; peak voxel r = 0.73). Furthermore, the analysis of treatment effects revealed a increase in hippocampal volume in the ECT sample (MNI coordinates x = -28, y = -9, z = -18; Z score, 7.81; P < .001) that was missing in the medication-only sample. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A relatively small degree of structural impairment in the subgenual cingulate cortex before therapy seems to be associated with successful treatment with ECT. In the future, neuroimaging techniques could prove to be promising tools for predicting the individual therapeutic effectiveness of ECT.",2016,Jun 1,JAMA Psychiatry,73,6,557-64,27145449.0,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.0316,,#1035,Redlich 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Effect of a Web-Based Guided Self-help Intervention for Prevention of Major Depression in Adults With Subthreshold Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Buntrock, C.; Ebert, D. D.; Lehr, D.; Smit, F.; Riper, H.; Berking, M.; Cuijpers, P.","IMPORTANCE: Evidence-based treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are not very successful in improving functional and health outcomes. Attention has increasingly been focused on the prevention of MDD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based guided self-help intervention for the prevention of MDD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two-group randomized clinical trial conducted between March 1, 2013, and March 4, 2015. Participants were recruited in Germany from the general population via a large statutory health insurance company (ie, insurance funded by joint employer-employee contributions). Participants included 406 self-selected adults with subthreshold depression (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score >/=16, no current MDD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition, Text Revision] criteria). INTERVENTIONS: All participants had unrestricted access to usual care (visits to the primary care clinician) and were randomized to either a web-based guided self-help intervention (cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving therapy supported by an online trainer; n = 202) or a web-based psychoeducation program (n = 204). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD in the intervention group relative to the control group over a 12-month follow-up period as assessed by blinded diagnostic raters using the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis Disorders at 6- and 12-month follow-up, covering the period to the previous assessment. RESULTS: Among 406 randomized patients (mean age, 45 years; 73.9% women), 335 (82%) completed the telephone follow-up at 12 months. Fifty-five participants (27%) in the intervention group experienced MDD compared with 84 participants (41%) in the control group. Cox regression analyses controlling for baseline depressive symptom severity revealed a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.42-0.82; P = .002) at 12-month follow-up. The number needed to treat to avoid 1 new case of MDD was 5.9 (95% CI, 3.9-14.6). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with subthreshold depression, the use of a web-based guided self-help intervention compared with enhanced usual care reduced the incidence of MDD over 12 months. Further research is needed to understand whether the effects are generalizable to both first onset of depression and depression recurrence as well as efficacy without the use of an online trainer.

Risk of Suicide Attempt in Patients With Recent Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment or Dementia,"Gunak, M. M.; Barnes, D. E.; Yaffe, K.; Li, Y.; Byers, A. L.","IMPORTANCE: Little is known about the association between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and suicide. Most studies have focused on dementia and suicidal behavior, with inconsistent results. OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between diagnoses of MCI and dementia and suicide attempt and explore potential psychiatric moderators and to assess whether the association differs based on recency of diagnosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cohort study integrated 5 national databases from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and included all VA medical centers in the US. US veterans 50 years or older with MCI diagnoses at baseline (October 1, 2011, to September 30, 2013) or earlier (October 1, 2007, to September 30, 2011) were propensity matched 1:3 with (1) patients with dementia diagnoses and (2) patients without either diagnosis based on demographic characteristics and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Diagnoses of MCI or dementia were defined as recent if there were no diagnosis codes before baseline. Data were analyzed from March 16, 2020, to January 15, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Information on suicide attempts through December 31, 2016, provided by the National Suicide Prevention Applications Network (nonfatal) and Mortality Data Repository (fatal). RESULTS: The study population of 147 595 participants included 21 085 patients with MCI, 63 255 with dementia, and 63 255 in the propensity-matched comparison group. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 74.7 (10.3) years, 143 353 (97.1%) were men, 4242 (2.9%) were women, and 127 065 (86.1%) were non-Hispanic White. A total of 138 patients with MCI (0.7%) and 400 patients with dementia (0.6%) attempted suicide during follow-up, compared with 253 patients without MCI or dementia (0.4%). Exploratory analyses revealed that no psychiatric comorbidity moderated the association between MCI or dementia and suicide attempt. After adjustment for demographic details and medical and psychiatric comorbidities, risk of suicide attempt was consistently highest for patients with a recent MCI or dementia diagnosis, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.73 (95% CI, 1.34-2.22; P < .001) for recent MCI and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.17-1.77; P = .001) for recent dementia. Risk associated with prior diagnosis was not significant (HR for prior MCI, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.78-1.36; P = .84]; HR for prior dementia, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.95-1.36; P = .15]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that older adults with recent MCI or dementia diagnoses were at increased risk of attempting suicide. These findings suggest that involvement of supportive services at the time of or soon after diagnoses of MCI or dementia may help mitigate risk of suicide attempts.",2021,Jun 1,JAMA Psychiatry,78,6,659-666,33760039.0,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.0150,,#1038,Gunak 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Prevalence, Onset, and Course of Suicidal Behavior Among Adolescents and Young Adults in Germany","Voss, C.; Ollmann, T. M.; Miche, M.; Venz, J.; Hoyer, J.; Pieper, L.; Hofler, M.; Beesdo-Baum, K.","IMPORTANCE: Suicidal behavior is a leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults. In light of the ideation-to-action framework, the delineation of frequency and temporal characteristics of such behavior during this developmental period is crucial. OBJECTIVES: To provide lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates of suicidal behavior, including ideation, plan, and attempt, in adolescents and young adults of the general population, and to provide information about age at onset, temporal characteristics of suicidal behavior, including duration (number of years between onset and last occurrence) and frequency (number of episodes), and transition patterns across suicidal behaviors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in a random community sample of 1180 adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 21 years assessed in 2015 to 2016 in Dresden, Germany. Data analysis was performed from October 2018 to March 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime and 12-month suicidal behavior (ideation, plan, and attempt) were assessed with a standardized diagnostic interview (Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview) by trained clinical interviewers. The onset, frequency, and duration of suicidal behavior were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 1180 participants (495 male [weighted percentage, 51.7%]; mean [SD] age, 17.9 [2.3] years), 130 participants (10.7%; 95% CI, 9.0%-12.8%), 65 participants (5.0%; 95% CI, 3.9%-6.5%), and 41 participants (3.4%; 95% CI, 2.4%-4.7%) reported lifetime suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt, respectively. Any lifetime suicidal behavior was reported by 138 participants (11.5%; 95% CI, 9.7%-13.7%). Age-specific cumulative incidence estimates indicated an increase in suicidal behavior during adolescence, starting at age 10 years (<1%), increasing slightly until the age of 12 years (2.2%), and then increasing sharply thereafter until age 20 years (13.5%). There were different patterns among female and male participants for ideation, plan, and attempt, with an overall higher incidence among female participants for ideation (hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.22; P = .04), for plan (hazard ratio, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.72-6.36; P < .001), and, among those older than 14 years, for attempt (hazard ratio, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.11-8.49; P = .03). Of those with suicidal ideation, 66.0% reported persistent or recurrent ideation over more than 1 year with 75.0% reporting more than 1 episode. Of the participants with lifetime suicidal ideation, 47.0% reported a suicide plan and 23.9% reported a suicide attempt. The transition to suicide plan or attempt occurred mainly in the year of onset of suicidal ideation or plan; of those who transitioned, 74.9% transitioned from ideation to plan, 71.2% transitioned from ideation to attempt, and 85.4% transitioned from plan to attempt in the same year.

Cortical Representation of Afferent Bodily Signals in Borderline Personality Disorder: Neural Correlates and Relationship to Emotional Dysregulation,"Muller, L. E.; Schulz, A.; Andermann, M.; Gabel, A.; Gescher, D. M.; Spohn, A.; Herpertz, S. C.; Bertsch, K.","IMPORTANCE: The ability to perceive and regulate one's own emotions has been tightly linked to the processing of afferent bodily signals (interoception). Thus, disturbed interoception might contribute to the core feature of emotional dysregulation in borderline personality disorder (BPD), as increased levels of depersonalization, body image disturbances, and reduced sensitivity to physical pain suggest poor body awareness in BPD. OBJECTIVE: To determine neural correlates of disturbed body awareness in BPD and its associations with emotional dysregulation and to explore improvements in body awareness with BPD symptom remission. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control study performed at Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany. Heartbeat evoked potentials (HEPs), an indicator of the cortical representation of afferent signals from the cardiovascular system, were investigated in 34 medication-free patients with BPD, 31 healthy volunteers, and 17 medication-free patients with BPD in remission. The HEPs were assessed using 5-minute resting-state electroencephalograms and parallel electrocardiograms. Core BPD symptoms, history of childhood traumatization, and psychiatric disorders were assessed by means of self-reports and structured interviews. To measure neural correlates of disturbed body awareness, high-resolution T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry and region-of-interest-based approaches. The study was performed between 2012 and 2014, and data analysis was performed in 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean HEP amplitudes in resting-state electroencephalograms and their correlation with self-reported emotional dysregulation, as well as with gray matter volume. RESULTS: Patients with BPD had significantly reduced mean HEP amplitudes compared with healthy volunteers (F1,61 = 11.32, P = .001), whereas the mean HEP amplitudes of patients with BDP in remission lie somewhere in between these 2 groups of participants (P > .05). The HEP amplitudes were negatively correlated with emotional dysregulation (R = -0.30, P = .01) and positively associated with gray matter volume in the left anterior insula (R = 0.53, P < .05) and the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (R = 0.47, P < .05), 2 structures that have been identified as core regions for interoception. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results indicate state-dependent deficits in the cortical processing of bodily signals in patients with BPD, which appear to be associated with core features of BPD. The analysis of patients with BPD in remission suggests an improvement in cortical representation of bodily signals with symptom remission.

L.; Dannlowski, U.","IMPORTANCE: The structural abnormalities in the brain that accurately differentiate unipolar depression (UD) and bipolar depression (BD) remain unidentified. OBJECTIVES: First, to investigate and compare morphometric changes in UD and BD, and to replicate the findings at 2 independent neuroimaging sites; second, to differentiate UD and BD using multivariate pattern classification techniques. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a 2-center cross-sectional study, structural gray matter data were obtained at 2 independent sites (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Munster, Germany) using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare local gray and white matter volumes, and a novel pattern classification approach was used to discriminate between UD and BD, while training the classifier at one imaging site and testing in an independent sample at the other site. The Pittsburgh sample of participants was recruited from the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at the University of Pittsburgh from 2008 to 2012. The Munster sample was recruited from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Munster from 2010 to 2012. Equally divided between the 2 sites were 58 currently depressed patients with bipolar I disorder, 58 age- and sex-matched unipolar depressed patients, and 58 matched healthy controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect structural differences between groups. Morphometric analyses were applied using voxel-based morphometry. Pattern classification techniques were used for a multivariate approach. RESULTS: At both sites, individuals with BD showed reduced gray matter volumes in the hippocampal formation and the amygdala relative to individuals with UD (Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates x = -22, y = -1, z = 20; k = 1938 voxels; t = 4.75), whereas individuals with UD showed reduced gray matter volumes in the anterior cingulate gyrus compared with individuals with BD (Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates x = -8, y = 32, z = 3; k = 979 voxels; t = 6.37; all corrected P < .05). Reductions in white matter volume within the cerebellum and hippocampus were found in individuals with BD.

Dimensions and disorder specificity of impulsivity in pathological gambling,"Kraplin, A.; Buhringer, G.; Oosterlaan, J.; van den Brink, W.; Goschke, T.; Goudriaan, A. E.","Impulsivity is a core characteristic of pathological gambling (PG), even though the underlying structure and disorder specificity is unclear. This study aimed to explore different dimensions of impulsivity in a clinical sample including PG. Furthermore, we aimed to test which alterations of the impulsivity-related dimensions are disorder specific for PG. Participants were individuals diagnosed with PG (n=51) and two groups also characterized by various impulsive behaviors: an alcohol dependence (AD; n=45) and a Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS; n=49) group. A healthy control (HC; n=53) group was recruited as comparison group. A comprehensive assessment was used including impulsivity-related and antipodal parameters of the Stop Signal Task, Stroop Task, Tower of London Task, Card Playing Task, Iowa Gambling Task and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11. Principal axis factor analysis revealed four impulsivity-related dimensions that were labeled 'self-reported impulsivity', 'prepotent response impulsivity', 'choice impulsivity' and 'motor impulsivity'. The PG group scored significantly higher on all four dimensions compared to the HC group. In contrast, the PG group did not differ on any of the dimensions from the AD or the GTS group, except for 'choice impulsivity' where the PG group exhibited higher factor scores compared to the GTS group. Altogether, PG is associated with generally heightened impulsivity profiles compared to a HC group, which may be further used for intervention strategies. However, heightened scores in the impulsivity dimensions are not disorder specific for PG. Further research on shared or different underlying mechanisms of these overlapping impulsivity impairments is necessary.",2014,Nov,Addict Behav,39,11,1646-1651,24930455.0,10.1016/j.addbeh.2014.05.021,,#1042,Kraplin 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

The sample consisted of severely impaired adolescents with remarkable deficits regarding psychic structure. The current study wanted to examine if the manualized treatment did not only reduce symptoms but also enhance the structural level of the patients. The axis structure of the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics in Childhood and Adolescence (OPD-CA) was used to assess the structural level of N = 46 adolescent inpatients. To examine differences between the patients' structural level at the beginning and at the end of inpatient treatment we conducted a repeated measures ANOVA. The overall score as well as the three subscores of the axis structure improved significantly during inpatient treatment. The corresponding effect sizes were large (eta(2) = .29 to .47).

Empathy and correct mental state inferences both promote prosociality,"Lehmann, K.; Bockler, A.; Klimecki, O.; Muller-Liebmann, C.; Kanske, P.","In a world with rapidly increasing population that competes for the earth's limited resources, cooperation is crucial. While research showed that empathizing with another individual in need enhances prosociality, it remains unclear whether correctly inferring the other's inner, mental states on a more cognitive level (i.e., mentalizing) elicits helping behavior as well. We applied a video-based laboratory task probing empathy and a performance measure of mentalizing in adult volunteers (N = 94) and assessed to which extent they were willing to help the narrators in the videos. We replicate findings that an empathy induction leads to more prosocial decisions. Crucially, we also found that correct mentalizing increases the willingness to help.

The Effect of Hunger and Satiety on Mood-Related Food Craving,"Reents, J.; Seidel, A. K.; Wiesner, C. D.; Pedersen, A.","In addition to hunger, which results from food deprivation, fasting, or restrained eating, food craving is thought to be one of the major factors influencing eating behavior. Although food craving occurs in healthy humans with normal eating behavior, research suggests pronounced food craving to be a risk factor for binging food, which in turn might cause weight gain and obesity. In addition, negative mood seems to induce binge eating, although the underlying processes are not clearly understood. To examine these effects on momentary food craving more closely, we implemented a food cue-reactivity paradigm in 33 normal-weight females (mean age = 25.1 years, mean BMI = 21.6). Mood (negative vs. neutral) and state of food deprivation (hunger vs. satiety) were varied systematically. Self-rated craving was significantly higher in hungry compared to sated states. Moreover, in neutral mood, high-caloric foods modulated craving, i.e., hungry and sated participants preferred savory food and sweet food, respectively. In negative mood, this differential effect of savory and sweet items was absent. In summary, the state of hunger has a huge impact on food craving, which is further modulated by emotional state. Future research should consider hunger to be of high relevance for effects investigated in food-related paradigms. Our findings in healthy women of normal weight support etiological models of disturbed eating behavior and are in line with common interventions targeting eating schedules and mood regulation.",2020,2020/11/02,Front Psychol,11,,568908,33224061.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568908,,#1045,Reents 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Sleep-dependent selective imitation in infants,"Konrad, C.; Dirks, N. D.; Warmuth, A.; Herbert, J. S.; Schneider, S.; Seehagen, S.","In adults, sleep selectively consolidates those memories that are relevant for future events. The present study tested whether napping after encoding plays a role in selective memory consolidation in infants. Infants aged 15 and 24 months (n = 48 per age) were randomly assigned to a nap or a no-nap demonstration condition, or a baseline control condition. In the demonstration conditions, infants observed an experimenter perform an irrelevant action followed by a relevant action to achieve a desirable outcome on four different toys. Infant imitation of irrelevant and relevant actions was coded at a test session that occurred after a 24-hr delay. The demonstration and test sessions were scheduled around infants' naturally occurring sleeping patterns. When order of actions was not taken into account, infants in both demonstration conditions exhibited retention of the relevant and irrelevant target actions. Contrary to expectations, infants in the nap condition did not perform the relevant action only more often than infants in the no-nap condition. As expected, only infants in the no-nap condition faithfully reproduced the two actions in the demonstrated order: irrelevant action first, followed by the relevant action. Thus, sleep might help infants to selectively ""discard"" aspects of a learning experience that they identify as being not useful or relevant in the future.",2019,Feb,J Sleep Res,28,1,e12777,30334304.0,10.1111/jsr.12777,,#1046,Konrad 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The Influence of Physiological and Psychological Learning Mechanisms in Neurofeedback vs. Mental Imagery Against Binge Eating,"Schmidt, J.; Martin, A.","In biofeedback research, the debate on physiological versus psychological learning has a long tradition and is still relevant today, regarding new developments of biofeedback for behavior modification. Analyzing the role of these learning mechanisms may help improving the protocols and answer the question, whether feedback of physiological functions is necessary to modify a target behavior. We explored the presence and impact of physiological (EEG changes) versus psychological learning (changes in somatic self-efficacy) in a recently developed EEG neurofeedback protocol for binge eating. The protocol targets a reduction of food-cue induced cortical arousal through regulation of EEG high beta activity. In an experimental study accompanying a randomized controlled trial, pre and post treatment EEG measurements were analyzed in a neurofeedback group (n = 18) and an active mental imagery control group without physiological feedback (n = 18). Physiological learning in terms of EEG high beta reduction only occurred in the neurofeedback group. Post treatment, participants with successfully reduced binge eating episodes (>/= 50% reduction) showed lower EEG high beta activity than unsuccessful participants (p = .02) after neurofeedback, but not after mental imagery. Further, lower EEG high beta activity at post-treatment predicted fewer binge eating episodes in neurofeedback only. In mental imagery, somatic self-efficacy predicted treatment success instead of EEG activity. Altogether, the results indicate that physiological changes serve as a specific treatment mechanism in neurofeedback against binge eating. Reducing cortical arousal may improve eating behaviors and corresponding neurofeedback techniques should therefore be considered in future treatments.",2020,Dec,Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback,45,4,293-305,32990891.0,10.1007/s10484-020-09486-9,,#1047,Schmidt 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Appetitive vs. Aversive conditioning in humans,"Andreatta, M.; Pauli, P.","In classical conditioning, an initially neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) becomes associated with a biologically salient event (unconditioned stimulus, US), which might be pain (aversive conditioning) or food (appetitive conditioning). After a few associations, the CS is able to initiate either defensive or consummatory responses, respectively. Contrary to aversive conditioning, appetitive conditioning is rarely investigated in humans, although its importance for normal and pathological behaviors (e.g., obesity, addiction) is undeniable. The present study intents to translate animal findings on appetitive conditioning to humans using food as an US. Thirty-three participants were investigated between 8 and 10 am without breakfast in order to assure that they felt hungry. During two acquisition phases, one geometrical shape (avCS+) predicted an aversive US (painful electric shock), another shape (appCS+) predicted an appetitive US (chocolate or salty pretzel according to the participants' preference), and a third shape (CS-) predicted neither US. In a extinction phase, these three shapes plus a novel shape (NEW) were presented again without US delivery. Valence and arousal ratings as well as startle and skin conductance (SCR) responses were collected as learning indices. We found successful aversive and appetitive conditioning. On the one hand, the avCS+ was rated as more negative and more arousing than the CS- and induced startle potentiation and enhanced SCR. On the other hand, the appCS+ was rated more positive than the CS- and induced startle attenuation and larger SCR. In summary, we successfully confirmed animal findings in (hungry) humans by demonstrating appetitive learning and normal aversive learning.",2015,2015/05/19,Front Behav Neurosci,9,,128,26042011.0,10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00128,,#1048,Andreatta 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Connections are not enough for membership: Letter/non-letter distinction persists through phonological association learning,"Schmitt, A.; van Leeuwen, C.; Lachmann, T.","In compound, hierarchical stimuli (also known as Navon figures), a Global Precedence Effect (GPE) can reliably be observed for both letters and non-letters. However, when presentation conditions sufficiently resemble those of reading, the GPE for letters has occasionally been found to disappear. We corroborate this effect in a study with a large group of participants. In addition, in-between two sessions, participants were trained in associating the non-letters with either phonological or non-phonological sounds. We reasoned that learning distinctive phonological associations might be akin to the acquisition of letter knowledge. This might eliminate the GPE also for the non-letters. However, the GPE persisted for the trained non-letters in both conditions. The large number of participants in this study revealed additional effects in the letter condition, which enabled further insights in the processing dissociation between letters and non-letter shapes.",2017,May,Acta Psychol (Amst),176,,85-91,28407502.0,10.1016/j.actpsy.2017.03.015,,#1049,Schmitt 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Measuring fluctuations across the Continuum of Auditory Hallucinations. Development and validation of a state inventory,"Schlier, B.; Hennig, T.; Lincoln, T. M.","In order to identify causes and triggers of hallucinations that can inform therapy, reliable, valid, and change-sensitive instruments to assess hallucinatory experiences in the subclinical and clinical range are needed. We developed and validated a novel scale, the Continuum of Auditory Hallucinations - State Assessment (CAHSA), to be used for repeated assessment of the subclinical factors vivid imagination, intrusive thoughts, and perceptual sensitivity as well as auditory hallucinations. After selecting items for the four factors in a first test sample (n=84), we tested factorial validity using CFA and criterion validity with self-reported psychosis-like experiences (n=534). Finally, within-subject variation of CAHSA scores over 14 days and time-lagged associations between its factors were explored (n=85). A 9-item CAHSA was selected that showed good factorial validity, criterion validity, and substantial, valid within-subject variation.

Emotional sounds modulate early neural processing of emotional pictures,"Gerdes, A. B.; Wieser, M. J.; Bublatzky, F.; Kusay, A.; Plichta, M. M.; Alpers, G. W.","In our natural environment, emotional information is conveyed by converging visual and auditory information; multimodal integration is of utmost importance. In the laboratory, however, emotion researchers have mostly focused on the examination of unimodal stimuli. Few existing studies on multimodal emotion processing have focused on human communication such as the integration of facial and vocal expressions. Extending the concept of multimodality, the current study examines how the neural processing of emotional pictures is influenced by simultaneously presented sounds. Twenty pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral pictures of complex scenes were presented to 22 healthy participants. On the critical trials these pictures were paired with pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral sounds. Sound presentation started 500 ms before picture onset and each stimulus presentation lasted for 2 s. EEG was recorded from 64 channels and ERP analyses focused on the picture onset. In addition, valence and arousal ratings were obtained. Previous findings for the neural processing of emotional pictures were replicated. Specifically, unpleasant compared to neutral pictures were associated with an increased parietal P200 and a more pronounced centroparietal late positive potential (LPP), independent of the accompanying sound valence. For audiovisual stimulation, increased parietal P100 and P200 were found in response to all pictures which were accompanied by unpleasant or pleasant sounds compared to pictures with neutral sounds. Most importantly, incongruent audiovisual pairs of unpleasant pictures and pleasant sounds enhanced parietal P100 and P200 compared to pairings with congruent sounds. Taken together, the present findings indicate that emotional sounds modulate early stages of visual processing and, therefore, provide an avenue by which multimodal experience may enhance perception.",2013,,Front Psychol,4,,741,24151476.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00741,,#1052,Gerdes 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
When dyspnea gets worse: Suffocation fear and the dynamics of defensive respiratory responses to increasing interoceptive threat,"Benke, C.; Hamm, A. O.; Pane-Farre, C. A.","In patients with anxiety and/or respiratory diseases, body sensations, particularly from the respiratory system, may increase in intensity and aversiveness and thus lead into defensive action (e.g., escape) or panic. The processes, however, that might contribute to the culmination of symptoms and the switch into defensive action have not been well understood yet. The current study aimed at evaluating an experimental paradigm to characterize the dynamics of defensive mobilization to body sensations increasing in intensity and aversiveness. Persons reporting low and high suffocation fear (SF; N = 69) were exposed to increasingly unpleasant feelings of dyspnea induced by inspiratory resistive loads and a breathing occlusion requiring voluntary breath holding. Respiratory responses were assessed along with subjective reports of anxiety and panic symptoms. Presentation of respiratory loads with increasing physical resistance led to increasingly unpleasant feelings of dyspnea. Twenty-eight participants terminated the exposure prematurely at least once. When dyspnea was severe, high compared to low SF persons exhibited an increased respiratory rate that was accompanied by reports of more intense panic symptoms. Premature terminations of exposure were preceded by a surge in anxiety, breathing frequency, and mouth pressure, and a decrease in tidal volume. We successfully established an experimental paradigm to assess changes in defensive responding with increasing intensity of an interoceptive threat. The current data foster our understanding of behavioral expression patterns observed in patients with anxiety and/or respiratory diseases and the processes involved in the culmination of bodily sensations and anxiety into panic.",2017,Sep,Psychophysiology,54,9,1266-1283,28466488.0,10.1111/psyp.12881,,#1053,Benke 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Bridging psychophysiological and phenomenological characteristics of psychosis--Preliminary evidence for the relevance of emotion regulation,"Clamor, A.; Schlier, B.; Kother, U.; Hartmann, M. M.; Moritz, S.; Lincoln, T. M.","In psychosis, the alleged increased subjective stress-sensitivity is reflected in abnormal physiological arousal such as higher heart rate, elevated skin conductance levels, decreased vagal activity, and unusual cortisol levels. Despite ongoing research, possible mechanisms that explain the interplay between the phenomenological (i.e., subjective stress and symptoms) and psychophysiological processes are not thoroughly understood. Building on the model of neurovisceral integration by Thayer and Lane (2000) that focuses on regulative mechanisms, we postulate that emotion regulation will be associated with vagal activity, and with both subjective and physiological stress. In the present analysis, we used data from a baseline relaxation period including a 5-minute assessment of heart rate variability (HRV), salivary cortisol, and momentary subjective stress ratings from a sample of 19 participants with psychosis (mean age=40.9, SD=11.1; 36.8% female). Emotion regulation modification skills were assessed for specific emotions (i.e., stress and arousal, anxiety, anger, sadness, shame) if these were present during the previous week. Vagal HRV was significantly and moderately associated with emotion regulation. Both stress parameters (i.e., cortisol, subjective stress) were significantly associated with emotion regulation, but not with HRV. We provide preliminary support for the notion that emotion regulatory processes represent a crucial link between phenomenological and psychophysiological phenomena in psychosis. A potential model that ascribes emotion regulation a central role in the restoration of homeostasis is discussed. Future studies are needed to verify its generalizability and predictive value.",2015,Dec,Schizophr Res,169,1-3,346-350,26530627.0,10.1016/j.schres.2015.10.035,,#1054,Clamor 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The Use of Digitally Assessed Stress Levels to Model Change Processes in CBT - A Feasibility Study on Seven Case Examples,"Hehlmann, M. I.; Schwartz, B.; Lutz, T.; Gomez Penedo, J. M.; Rubel, J. A.; Lutz, W.","In psychotherapy research, the measurement of treatment processes and outcome are predominantly based on self-reports. However, given new technological developments, other potential sources can be considered to improve measurements. In a feasibility study, we examined whether Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) using digital phenotyping (stress level) can be a valuable tool to investigate change processes during cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Seven outpatients undergoing psychological treatment were assessed using EMA. Continuous stress levels (heart rate variability) were assessed via fitness trackers (Garmin) every 3 min over a 2-week time period (6,720 measurements per patient). Time-varying change point autoregressive (TVCP-AR) models were employed to detect both gradual and abrupt changes in stress levels. Results for seven case examples indicate differential patterns of change processes in stress. More precisely, inertia of stress level changed gradually over time in one of the participants, whereas the other participants showed both gradual and abrupt changes. This feasibility study demonstrates that intensive longitudinal assessments enriched by digitally assessed stress levels have the potential to investigate intra- and interindividual differences in treatment change processes and their relations to treatment outcome.

How delays matter in an oscillatory whole-brain spiking-neuron network model for MEG alpha-rhythms at rest,"Nakagawa, T. T.; Woolrich, M.; Luckhoo, H.; Joensson, M.; Mohseni, H.; Kringelbach, M. L.; Jirsa, V.; Deco, G.","In recent years the study of the intrinsic brain dynamics in a relaxed awake state in the absence of any specific task has gained increasing attention, as spontaneous neural activity has been found to be highly structured at a large scale. This so called resting-state activity has been found to be comprised by nonrandom spatiotemporal patterns and fluctuations, and several Resting-State Networks (RSN) have been found in BOLD-fMRI as well as in MEG signal power envelope correlations. The underlying anatomical connectivity structure between areas of the brain has been identified as being a key to the observed functional network connectivity, but the mechanisms behind this are still underdetermined. Theoretical large-scale brain models for fMRI data have corroborated the importance of the connectome in shaping network dynamics, while the importance of delays and noise differ between studies and depend on the models' specific dynamics. In the current study, we present a spiking neuron network model that is able to produce noisy, distributed alpha-oscillations, matching the power peak in the spectrum of group resting-state MEG recordings. We studied how well the model captured the inter-node correlation structure of the alpha-band power envelopes for different delays between brain areas, and found that the model performs best for propagation delays inside the physiological range (5-10 m/s). Delays also shift the transition from noisy to bursting oscillations to higher global coupling values in the model. Thus, in contrast to the asynchronous fMRI state, delays are important to consider in the presence of oscillation.",2014,Feb 15,NeuroImage,87,,383-94,24246492.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.11.009,,#1056,Nakagawa 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Mortality increased 81.3% in low adherence countries (United States, Sweden, Poland, Russia), 8.4% in high adherence countries (Germany, France, Spain, United Kingdom). Across countries adherence and subsequent mortality increases correlated with r = -0.91. No African or South American countries were included in the present study, which limits the generalizability of the findings.

We compared fear acquisition and fear extinction learning between a group of patients with either an anxiety disorder (n = 93) or depression (n = 103) attending for treatment in our outpatient center and a sample of healthy control participants (n = 60). To assess the specificity of the predictive validity of extinction learning and safety learning for the outcome of exposure-based treatments, patients additionally underwent disorder-specific cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). We found only very little evidence for differences in safety or extinction learning between healthy controls and patients with anxiety-disorders or depression using both a group-based categorical analytic approach, as well as a trans-diagnostic, dimensional analytic approach. On the contrary, for anxiety patients only, more favorable extinction learning and more favorable safety learning was associated with more favorable treatment outcome. In sum, this specific prediction of treatment outcome in anxiety patients confirms and extends current theoretical models of exposure-based treatments for anxiety disorders, but does not support the notion of general extinction learning deficits in the anxiety disorders spectrum.",2023,Jan,Behav Res Ther,160,,104229,36463833.0,10.1016/j.brat.2022.104229,,#1060,Adolph 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Working memory load-dependent brain response predicts behavioral training gains in older adults,"Heinzel, S.; Lorenz, R. C.; Brockhaus, W. R.; Wustenberg, T.; Kathmann, N.; Heinz, A.; Rapp, M. A.","In the domain of working memory (WM), a sigmoid-shaped relationship between WM load and brain activation patterns has been demonstrated in younger adults. It has been suggested that age-related alterations of this pattern are associated with changes in neural efficiency and capacity. At the same time, WM training studies have shown that some older adults are able to increase their WM performance through training. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging during an n-back WM task at different WM load levels was applied to compare blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses between younger and older participants and to predict gains in WM performance after a subsequent 12-session WM training procedure in older adults. We show that increased neural efficiency and capacity, as reflected by more ""youth-like"" brain response patterns in regions of interest of the frontoparietal WM network, were associated with better behavioral training outcome beyond the effects of age, sex, education, gray matter volume, and baseline WM performance. Furthermore, at low difficulty levels, decreases in BOLD response were found after WM training. Results indicate that both neural efficiency (i.e., decreased activation at comparable performance levels) and capacity (i.e., increasing activation with increasing WM load) of a WM-related network predict plasticity of the WM system, whereas WM training may specifically increase neural efficiency in older adults.",2014,Jan 22,J Neurosci,34,4,1224-33,24453314.0,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2463-13.2014,,#1061,Heinzel 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

"Dealing With the COVID-19 Infodemic: Distress by Information, Information Avoidance, and Compliance With Preventive Measures","Siebenhaar, K. U.; Kother, A. K.; Alpers, G. W.","In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, media reports have caused anxiety and distress in many. In some individuals, feeling distressed by information may lead to avoidance of information, which has been shown to undermine compliance with preventive health behaviors in many health domains (e.g., cancer screenings). We set out to examine whether feeling distressed by information predicts higher avoidance of information about COVID-19 (avoidance hypothesis), and whether this, in turn, predicts worse compliance with measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (compliance hypothesis). Thus, we conducted an online survey with a convenience sample (N = 1,059, 79.4% female) and assessed distress by information, information avoidance, and compliance with preventive measures. Furthermore, we inquired about participants' information seeking behavior and media usage, their trust in information sources, and level of eHealth literacy, as well as generalized anxiety. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to predict distress by information, information avoidance, and compliance with preventive measures. Overall, distress by information was associated with better compliance. However, distress was also linked with an increased tendency to avoid information (avoidance hypothesis), and this reduced compliance with preventive measures (compliance hypothesis). Thus, distress may generally induce adaptive behavior in support of crisis management, unless individuals respond to it by avoiding information. These findings provide insights into the consequences of distress by information and avoidance of information during a global health crisis. These results underscore that avoiding information is a maladaptive response to distress by information, which may ultimately interfere with effective crisis management. Consequently, we emphasize the need to develop measures to counteract information avoidance.",2020,2020/11/05,Front Psychol,11,,567905,33224060.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567905,,#1065,Siebenhaar 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
A question of morals? The role of moral identity in support of the youth climate movement Fridays4Future,"Misch, A.; Kristen-Antonow, S.; Paulus, M.","In the past year, an unprecedented climate movement has risen among European youth, so-called ""Fridays4Future"" (F4F). Thousands of pupils skip school every Friday to protest for better climate politics. The public debate on the protests contains highly mixed reactions, including praise as well as condemnation. Recent theoretical accounts propose that people's engagement in community service and actions towards a greater good could be related to their moral identity. Moral identity (MI) is defined as the extent to which being moral is important to the personal identity. The current preregistered study investigates the link between moral identity and participants' support for F4F in an online survey (N = 537). Results confirm the association between participants' moral identity and their support for F4F, with the internalization scale predicting passive forms of support and the symbolization scale predicting active forms of support. Additionally, risk perception was found to play an important role. Thus, this study confirms the role of moral identity in people's pro-environmental engagement and offers new insights in the context of an important and timely issue.",2021,2021/03/25,PLOS ONE,16,3,e0248353,33764974.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0248353,,#1066,Misch 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Data of N = 88 women recruited at the Heidelberg University Hospital were used in the analyses. Prepartum anxiety symptoms were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, general anxiety) and the Pregnancy Related Anxiety Questionnaire (PRAQ-R, pregnancy-specific anxiety). Obstetric outcome was taken from birth records and operationalized by two parameters: the total duration of birth (dilation and fetal expulsion) and the incidence of pregnancy or birth-related interventions (ventouse, planned, and unplanned Cesarean section). The data show that childbirth-specific anxiety assessed by the PRAQ-R is an important predictor of total birth duration. In contrast, general anxiety measured by the STAI had no effect. The incidence of birth intervention was explained by parity. Anxiety, however, had no predictive value.

Dissociating sub-processes of aftereffects of completed intentions and costs to the ongoing task in prospective memory: A mouse-tracking approach,"Kurtz, M.; Scherbaum, S.; Walser, M.; Kanske, P.; Moschl, M.","In the present study, we used mouse tracking to investigate two processes underlying prospective memory (PM) retrieval: First, we aimed to explore to what extent spontaneous retrieval of already completed PM intentions is supported by reflexive-associative and discrepancy-plus-search processes. Second, we aimed to disentangle whether costs to an ongoing task during the pursuit of a PM intention are associated with presumably resource-demanding monitoring processes or with a presumably resource-sparing strategic delay of ongoing-task responses. Our third aim was to explore the interaction of processes underlying costs to the ongoing task and processes of spontaneous retrieval. Our analyses replicated response-time patterns from previous studies indicating aftereffects of completed intentions and costs to ongoing-task performance, as well as increased aftereffects while pursuing a PM intention. Notably, based on our mouse-tracking analyses, we argue that aftereffects of completed intentions are best explained by a reflexive initiation of an already completed intention. If the completed intention is not performed in its entirety (i.e., no commission error), the reflexive initiation of the completed intention is followed by a subsequent movement correction that most likely represents a time-consuming response-verification process. Regarding performance costs in the ongoing task, our analyses suggest that actively pursuing a PM intention most likely leads to a strategic delay of ongoing activities. Lastly, we found that pursuing a novel PM task after intention completion exacerbated orienting responses to all deviant stimuli, exacerbated the readiness to initiate the completed intention reflexively, and substantially prolonged the response-verification process following this reflexive intention retrieval.",2022,Oct,Mem Cognit,50,7,1590-1613,35212979.0,10.3758/s13421-022-01289-z,,#1068,Kurtz 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Therefore, 1 cm hair strands were collected from a cohort of 72 German EMS personnel in order to measure concentrations of cortisol, endocannabinoids [i.e., anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)], and N-acylethanolamines [i.e., stearoylethanolamide (SEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA)]. Rank correlation analyses were conducted to test associations of cortisol, endocannabinoid, and N-acylethanolamine concentrations with the EMS personnel's workload, lifetime trauma exposure, and mental and physical health problems. We found a negative correlation between cortisol and 2-AG concentrations in hair. Higher hair cortisol was associated with higher workload. Reported traumatic stress during childhood and later in life as well as more severe depressive and physical stress symptoms were associated with elevated 2-AG, SEA, OEA, and PEA concentrations.

"Link Between Irrational Beliefs and Important Markers of Mental Health in a German Sample of Athletes: Differences Between Gender, Sport-Type, and Performance Level","Michel-Krohler, A.; Turner, M. J.","In this article, we conducted the first meaningful study of irrational beliefs (IBs) in a German sample of athletes. Moreover, we investigated associations between IBs and potential general as well as sport-specific markers of mental health in German athletes. As general markers, we considered psychological distress and wellbeing in addition to IBs, and as sport-specific markers, we considered anxiety, perfectionism, and athletic identity. To achieve this, our first step was to translate and validate a specific measure of irrational beliefs, namely the Irrational Performance Beliefs Inventory (iPBI). The iPBI is a performance-relevant measure that captures specific IB, taking into account the situational circumstances of the target population, namely operators in different performance context (academia, sports, business, medicine, etc.). Its theoretical basis is largely Ellis' work on rational and irrational beliefs. We developed a short and a long version of the iPBI, which both capture four core IBs (i.e., demandingness, awfulization, low frustration tolerance, and depreciation). Factorial validity was confirmed by a confirmatory factor analysis (comparative fit index = 0.92) with data from 234 athletes. Both versions of the newly developed iPBI showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.77) and retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.71). Results of the correlational analyses indicated low positive relationships between IBs and athletes' psychological distress, and low negative relations between IBs and wellbeing. In terms of sport-specific markers, there were low to moderate correlations with IBs. This study also examined the differences in IBs between females and males, individual and team sport athletes, and across three different performance levels. Implications of these findings are discussed along with approaches for future research and applied work.",2022,2022/07/22,Front Psychol,13,,918329,35941956.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918329,,#1070,Michel-Krohler 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Saliva samples were collected before and after the stressor and assayed for salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and cortisol. Adverse childhood experiences were measured using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and attachment by the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised questionnaire. Results revealed that attachment avoidance and a combination of more adverse childhood experiences and attachment insecurity resulted in higher sAA levels and differences in reactivity to the stressor. Interactions between attachment anxiety and adverse childhood experiences were related to blunted cortisol reactivity.

Synchronous Stimulation With Light and Heat Induces Body Ownership and Reduces Pain Perception,"Cordier, L.; Fuchs, X.; Herpertz, S.; Trojan, J.; Diers, M.","In this study, we investigated whether illusionary body ownership over artificial hands and non-corporeal objects modulates pain perception. Previous research has yielded to mixed results, but has separated painful stimulation used to test pain perception from the stimulation that was used to induce the illusion. Here, we used a variant of the rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm and induced the illusion directly via a combination of visual and painful stimuli. We presented heat pain stimuli at the real hand and visual stimuli beneath a rubber hand (part1), or a glass ball (part2). Illusion ratings were higher and pain ratings were lower in the synchronous compared to the asynchronous condition in both parts of the experiment. This study demonstrated the successful induction of a body illusion using a new visual-thermal method with painful stimuli. We showed that the RHI and interestingly also the glass ball has an analgesic effect on the perception of the heat pain stimuli. Our data suggests that induced ownership over artificial limbs but also over non-corporeal objects can reduce the perceived pain perception. This might be mediated via a partial referral of the perceived location of pain or respectively a distribution of pain over 2 locations. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents a new visual-thermal method with painful stimuli for the induction of the Rubber Hand Illusion.

Abnormal processing of interpersonal cues during an aggressive encounter in women with borderline personality disorder: Neural and behavioral findings,"Bertsch, K.; Buades-Rotger, M.; Krauch, M.; Ueltzhoffer, K.; Kleindienst, N.; Herpertz, S. C.; Kramer, U. M.","Inappropriate aggression is a prominent and clinically relevant interpersonal dysfunction of individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Previous studies have shown that individuals with BPD interpret interpersonal signals in a hostile manner, but it is uncertain how this negativity bias impacts decision-making during aggressive encounters. In the present neuroimaging study, 48 medication-free women with BPD and 28 age- and intelligence-matched women played the Social Threat Aggression Paradigm (STAP), a competitive reaction time task in which the winner delivers an aversive sound blast to the loser. Crucially, in the STAP the alleged opponent displays either an angry or neutral facial expression at the beginning of each trial and selects increasingly loud blasts in order to provoke participants. Relative to healthy controls, women with BPD differentiated less between angry and neutral facial expressions, both in terms of aggressive behavior and of activity in medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and temporal pole. On the one hand, and contrary to our hypotheses, neural and behavioral responses to angry faces were reduced in women with BPD compared to healthy women. On the other hand, provocation heightened subsequent amygdala responses to neutral faces in BPD, and this was in turn associated with aggressive behavior, supporting a default negativity bias in BPD. The neurocognitive processes by which these alterations might guide aggressive behavior irrespective of interpersonal cues are presented and discussed.

Gray and white matter volume abnormalities in generalized anxiety disorder by categorical and dimensional characterization,"Hilbert, K.; Pine, D. S.; Muehlhan, M.; Lueken, U.; Steudte-Schmiedgen, S.; Beesdo-Baum, K.","Increasing efforts have been made to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but only limited consistent information is available on gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volume changes in affected adults. Additionally, few studies employed dimensional approaches to GAD pathology. This study compares structural brain imaging data from n=19 GAD subjects and n=24 healthy comparison (HC) subjects, all medication-free and matched on age, sex and education. Separate categorical and dimensional models were employed using voxel-based morphometry for GM and WM. Significantly higher GM volumes were found in GAD subjects mainly in basal ganglia structures and less consistently in the superior temporal pole. For WM, GAD subjects showed significantly lower volumes in the dlPFC. Largely consistent findings in dimensional and categorical models point toward these structural alterations being reliable and of importance for GAD. While lower volume in the dlPFC could reflect impaired emotional processing and control over worry in GAD, basal ganglia alterations may be linked to disturbed gain and loss anticipation as implicated in previous functional GAD studies. As perturbations in anticipation processes are central to GAD, these areas may warrant greater attention in future studies.",2015,Dec 30,Psychiatry Res,234,3,314-20,26490569.0,10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.10.009,,#1078,Hilbert 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"""I Know What I Like"" - Indecisiveness Is Unrelated to Behavioral Indicators of Evaluation Difficulties","Appel, H.; Englich, B.; Burghardt, J.","Indecisiveness, the subjective inability to make satisfying decisions, is an individual difference trait that may impede effective actions. Mechanisms underlying indecisiveness are largely unknown. In four studies, we tested the prediction that indicators of evaluation difficulty were associated with indecisiveness in simple evaluations. Across studies, indecisiveness was measured via self-report while evaluation difficulties were derived behaviorally from three indicators: difficulty distinguishing between similar evaluation objects (i.e., standard deviation of evaluation ratings), evaluation duration (reaction times), and implicit evaluations (evaluative priming effect) using familiar everyday objects. Study 1 (N = 151) was based on attractiveness evaluations of portraits. Studies 2a (N = 201) and 2b (N = 211) used chocolate as evaluation objects and manipulated to what extent the evaluations were equivalent to a decision. In Study 3 (N = 80) evaluations were measured implicitly through evaluative priming using food pictures. Contrary to our predictions, indecisiveness showed no reliable association to any indicator of evaluation difficulty, regardless of type of evaluation object, equivalence of evaluation and decision, and whether evaluation difficulty was based on explicit or implicit evaluations. All null findings were supported by Bayes factors. These counterintuitive results are a first step toward investigating evaluation processes as potential mechanisms underlying indecisiveness, showing that for both explicit and implicit measurements, indecisiveness is not characterized by difficulties when evaluating familiar everyday objects.",2021,2021/09/16,Front Psychol,12,,710880,34603135.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.710880,,#1079,Appel 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Temporal stability of functional brain modules associated with human intelligence,"Hilger, K.; Fukushima, M.; Sporns, O.; Fiebach, C. J.","Individual differences in general cognitive ability (i.e., intelligence) have been linked to individual variations in the modular organization of functional brain networks. However, these analyses have been limited to static (time-averaged) connectivity, and have not yet addressed whether dynamic changes in the configuration of brain networks relate to general intelligence. Here, we used multiband functional MRI resting-state data (N = 281) and estimated subject-specific time-varying functional connectivity networks. Modularity optimization was applied to determine individual time-variant module partitions and to assess fluctuations in modularity across time. We show that higher intelligence, indexed by an established composite measure, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), is associated with higher temporal stability (lower temporal variability) of brain network modularity. Post-hoc analyses reveal that subjects with higher intelligence scores engage in fewer periods of extremely high modularity - which are characterized by greater disconnection of task-positive from task-negative networks. Further, we show that brain regions of the dorsal attention network contribute most to the observed effect. In sum, our study suggests that investigating the temporal dynamics of functional brain network topology contributes to our understanding of the neural bases of general cognitive abilities.",2020,Feb 1,Hum Brain Mapp,41,2,362-372,31587450.0,10.1002/hbm.24807,,#1080,Hilger 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Acquisition of behavioral avoidance: task-irrelevant conditioned stimuli trigger costly decisions,"Pittig, A.; Schulz, A. R.; Craske, M. G.; Alpers, G. W.","Individuals avoid stimuli which are associated with aversive experience to preserve safety. However, behavioral avoidance also causes impairments and prevents the individual from attaining positive rewards. Little is known about the link between fear acquisition and the development of behavioral avoidance in the presence of potential rewards. Therefore, two experiments investigated the impact of fear conditioning on a subsequent gambling task. In an experimental group (n = 30) advantageous choices (higher reward probability) were linked to a fear-relevant stimulus that was associated with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) during fear conditioning (conditioned stimulus, CS+). A disadvantageous choice (lower reward probability) was, however, linked to a safe stimulus that was never associated with the US (CS-). In a control group (n = 25), fear conditioning was followed by a similar gambling task with novel stimuli. A second experiment focused on individual predictors of avoidant decisions (n = 81). Compared with the control group, individuals in the experimental groups avoided the advantageous CS + choice despite fewer gains. The predictor analysis further clarified that avoidant decisions were pronounced in highly trait anxious participants who exhibited higher fear responses. On the other hand, findings also indicated a reduction in absolute avoidance across the task. Combined, these findings demonstrate that fear conditioning can lead to avoidant decision making, especially in vulnerable individuals. The resulting costs parallel impairments caused by behavioral avoidance. Such an emotional decision-making style may be a link between aversive experience and the development of habitual pathological avoidance. Introducing rewards for approach, however, may counteract avoidant decisions.",2014,May,J Abnorm Psychol,123,2,314-29,24886006.0,10.1037/a0036136,,#1081,Pittig 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Most findings on mental aspects of BID are based on self-reports from sufferers. The aim of this pilot study is to examine cognitive and affective processes beyond what is accessible by self-reports. Therefore, n=5 BID-A, n=3 BID-P-sufferers, n=22 healthy controls and n=8 patients with body dysmorphic disorder (a further group with a strong desire for body modification) were tested. Selective attention bias (eye-tracking), tendency towards false memory (DRM-paradigm) and lack of affective involvement in the unwanted body part (induction and destruction of a rubber-hand/foot-illusion) were examined. Descriptive comparison of the groups showed that BID-A-sufferers fixated amputation stumps faster and longer than any other group and showed a reduced fear response when the body illusion was destroyed. There was no indication of a higher tendency towards false memory in either BID-group. Due to the small sample size, these results cannot be generalized. However, findings showed that BID-symptoms and underlying processes can be accessed in more ways than through self-reports. Moreover, results indicate that BID-A-sufferers selective attention and affective involvement differ from people not desiring an amputation.

The Neural Correlates of Probabilistic Classification Learning in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Pilot Study,"Hansmeier, J.; Exner, C.; Zetsche, U.; Jansen, A.","Individuals suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been found to show deficits in implicitly learning probabilistic associations between events. Neuroimaging studies have associated these implicit learning deficits in OCD individuals with aberrant activation of the striatal system. Recent behavioral studies have highlighted that probabilistic classification learning (PCL) deficits in OCD individuals only occur in a disorder-specific context, while PCL remains intact in a neutral context. The neural correlates of implicit learning in an OCD-specific context, however, have not yet been investigated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a neutral (prediction of weather) and an OCD-specific variant (prediction of a virus epidemic) of a PCL paradigm, we assessed brain activity associated with implicit learning processes in 10 participants with OCD and 10 matched healthy controls. Regions of interest (ROIs) were the striatum and the medial temporal lobe. ROI analyses revealed a significantly higher activity in the bilateral putamen and the left hippocampus of OCD participants as compared to healthy controls during both PCL tasks. The group differences could partly be subsumed under a group x task interaction effect with OCD participants showing a significantly higher activity than healthy controls in the left putamen and the left hippocampus in the OCD-specific task variant only. These results suggest a compensation of aberrant striatal activity by an augmented engagement of the explicit memory system particularly in a disorder-relevant context in OCD participants.",2018,2018/02/28,Front Psychiatry,9,,58,29599726.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00058,,#1083,Hansmeier 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The cost of fear: avoidant decision making in a spider gambling task,"Pittig, A.; Brand, M.; Pawlikowski, M.; Alpers, G.

However, few studies have accounted for such costs of fear-related avoidance in doing so. In this study, 51 spider fearful and 49 non-fearful participants completed the Spider Gambling Task, our modification of the Iowa Gambling Task, to investigate whether fear-relevant stimuli trigger avoidant decisions in the presence of potential rewards. In one version, advantageous choices were associated with pictures of spiders, whereas the same pictures were associated with disadvantageous choices in another version. Fearful participants generally avoided choices associated with pictures of spiders, which resulted in lower overall gains in the version with advantageous spider decks. Although this relative avoidance was sustained, fearful participants progressively approach more advantageous spider choices. These findings demonstrate that phobic fear results in irrational avoidant decisions which can result in considerable cost.

Temporal dynamics of insight in body dysmorphic disorder: An ecological momentary assessment study,"Schulte, J.; Dietel, F. A.; Wilhelm, S.; Nestler, S.; Buhlmann, U.","Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) often lack insight into the nature of their perceived appearance flaws that are slight, if they exist at all. Despite the generally held assumption that insight fluctuates over time within individuals with BDD, its temporal instability and associated features remain unstudied. We examined insight as a multidimensional, contextually embedded, and dynamic factor using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), further assessing affect and self-esteem as potentially associated states. Thirty individuals with BDD and 30 mentally healthy controls (HCs) completed 6 days of EMA (M = 8.54 assessments per day, N = 3075 assessments in total). Multilevel analyses revealed substantial intraindividual fluctuations of insight dimensions (across 30 min to hours) that were more pronounced for individuals with BDD than for HCs. Poorer insight correlated with higher negative affect, lower positive affect, and lower self-esteem at concurrent time points in the BDD group. Considering all predictors at the same time point, poorer insight was characterized by lower self-esteem and, partly, negative affect in the BDD group. Across time, self-esteem and insight influenced each other reciprocally, with comparatively stronger effects for the prediction of poorer insight by previously lower self-esteem. These findings demonstrate that insight is a highly variable phenomenon in BDD, further suggesting a clinically and etiologically relevant link between self-esteem and insight in symptom maintenance.

Psychometric properties of the S-Scale: Assessing a psychological mindset that mediates the relationship between socioeconomic status and depression,"Velten, J.; Scholten, S.; Brailovskaia, J.; Margraf, J.","Individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) are disproportionally affected by depressive disorders which are among the main causes for loss in healthy life years in adults worldwide. The main objective of the research presented here was to identify a psychological mindset of individuals with low SES and to investigate whether this mindset mediates the relationship between low SES and symptoms of depression. Towards these goals, a series of four studies was conducted: Study 1 identified a set of ten statements reflecting a psychological mindset associated with low SES using a population-based sample from Germany (N = 1,969). Study 2 cross-validated a psychometric scale (S-Scale) that was created based on these statements in a population-based sample from Germany (N = 3,907). Study 3 introduced a longitudinal perspective and showed that the S-Scale mediated the relationship between low SES and symptoms of depression assessed one year later in a German student sample (N = 1,275). Study 4 supported unidimensionality and construct validity of a unified version of the S-Scale and confirmed the mediation effect of the S-Scale for SES and depression while controlling for confounding variables (e.g., socially desirable responding) in a U.S. American convenience sample (N = 1,000). Evidence from four studies supported the reliability and validity of the S-Scale. Controlling for a psychological mindset as measured with this scale, low SES was no longer a predictor of depressive symptoms. The S-Scale can be used in clinical and research settings to assess a psychological mindset that puts individuals at risk for depression. Overall strengths of this series of studies include the use of population-based and longitudinal datasets and the application of findings to different operationalizations of SES.

Correspondingly, several studies report high rates of mental health problems among these occupations. Pet ownership has been associated with better mental health. However, to date a study on the association between pet ownership and indicators of mental health in these occupations is missing. The present cross-sectional survey (N = 580) investigated pet ownership, attachment to pets, health-benefitting factors (i.e., sense of coherence, trait-resilience, locus of control) and psychopathological symptoms (i.e., general mental health problems, posttraumatic stress, burnout) in medical staff, police officers, and firefighters. Dog owners and non-dog owners showed comparable levels of psychopathological distress and health-benefitting factors. Compared to cat owners, dog owners demonstrated stronger emotional attachment to their pet. Moreover, a stronger attachment was also linked to higher levels of psychopathological symptoms and lower levels of health-benefitting factors. However, the relationship between attachment to pets and health-benefitting factors could be explained by their overlap with psychopathological symptom levels.

On the Relation Between the (Censored) Shifted Wald and the Wiener Distribution as Measurement Models for Choice Response Times,"Miller, R.; Scherbaum, S.; Heck, D. W.; Goschke, T.; Enge, S.","Inferring processes or constructs from performance data is a major hallmark of cognitive psychometrics. Particularly, diffusion modeling of response times (RTs) from correct and erroneous responses using the Wiener distribution has become a popular measurement tool because it provides a set of psychologically interpretable parameters. However, an important precondition to identify all of these parameters is a sufficient number of RTs from erroneous responses. In the present article, we show by simulation that the parameters of the Wiener distribution can be recovered from tasks yielding very high or even perfect response accuracies using the shifted Wald distribution. Specifically, we argue that error RTs can be modeled as correct RTs that have undergone censoring by using techniques from parametric survival analysis. We illustrate our reasoning by fitting the Wiener and (censored) shifted Wald distribution to RTs from six participants who completed a Go/No-go task. In accordance with our simulations, diffusion modeling using the Wiener and the shifted Wald distribution yielded identical parameter estimates when the number of erroneous responses was predicted to be low. Moreover, the modeling of error RTs as censored correct RTs substantially improved the recovery of these diffusion parameters when premature trial timeout was introduced to increase the number of omission errors. Thus, the censored shifted Wald distribution provides a suitable means for diffusion modeling in situations when the Wiener distribution cannot be fitted without parametric constraints.",2018,Mar,Appl Psychol Meas,42,2,116-135,29881116.0,10.1177/0146621617710465,,#1089,Miller 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

We find that insecure attachment is associated with elevated perceptions of interpersonal disaffiliation and maladaptive strategies for affect regulation, whereas enacted interpersonal hostility is more distinctive for BPD. In a series of sensitivity analyses, we further highlight potential caveats to these findings when studying both constructs concurrently.

Effects of a three-week executive control training on adaptation to task difficulty and emotional interference,"Grutzmann, R.; Kathmann, N.; Heinzel, S.","Intact executive functions are characterized by flexible adaptation to task requirements, while these effects are reduced in internalizing disorders. Furthermore, as executive functions play an important role in emotion regulation, deficits in executive functions may contribute to symptom generation in psychological disorders through increased emotional interference. Thus, the present study investigated transfer effects of a three-week executive control training on adaptation to task difficulty and emotional interference in healthy participants (n = 24) to further explore the training's suitability for clinical application. To assess the adaptation to task difficulty, the proportion congruency effect on behavioral data (response times, error rates) and ERP measures (N2, CRN) was assessed in a flanker task with varying frequency of incompatible trials (25%, 75%). To quantify emotional interference, flanker stimuli were superimposed on neutral or negative pictures. Replicating previous results, the training increased interference control as indexed by decreased response times and errors rates, increased N2 amplitude and decreased CRN amplitude in incompatible trials after training. Proportion congruency effects were weaker than expected and not affected by the training intervention. The training lead to a shift in the time-point of emotional interference: before training negative pictures lead to a reduction in CRN amplitude, while after training this reduction was observed for the N2. This pattern illustrates that the training leads to a change in task processing mode from predominant response-related cognitive control to predominant stimulus-related cognitive control (N2), indicating a proactive processing mode.",2022,2022/11/22,PLOS ONE,17,11,e0276994,36413545.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0276994,,#1091,Grutzmann 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Changing external task demands have been shown to induce reconfiguration of functional brain networks. However, whether neural reconfiguration between different tasks is associated with intelligence has not yet been investigated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 812 subjects to show that higher scores of general intelligence are related to less brain network reconfiguration between resting state and seven different task states as well as to network reconfiguration between tasks. This association holds for all functional brain networks except the motor system and replicates in two independent samples (n = 138 and n = 184). Our findings suggest that the intrinsic network architecture of individuals with higher intelligence scores is closer to the network architecture as required by various cognitive demands.

How much time has passed? Ask your heart,"Pollatos, O.; Yeldesbay, A.; Pikovsky, A.; Rosenblum, M.","Internal signals like one's heartbeats are centrally processed via specific pathways and both their neural representations as well as their conscious perception (interoception) provide key information for many cognitive processes. Recent empirical findings propose that neural processes in the insular cortex, which are related to bodily signals, might constitute a neurophysiological mechanism for the encoding of duration. Nevertheless, the exact nature of such a proposed relationship remains unclear. We aimed to address this question by searching for the effects of cardiac rhythm on time perception by the use of a duration reproduction paradigm. Time intervals used were of 0.5, 2, 3, 7, 10, 14, 25, and 40 s length. In a framework of synchronization hypothesis, measures of phase locking between the cardiac cycle and start/stop signals of the reproduction task were calculated to quantify this relationship. The main result is that marginally significant synchronization indices (SIs) between the heart cycle and the time reproduction responses for the time intervals of 2, 3, 10, 14, and 25 s length were obtained, while results were not significant for durations of 0.5, 7, and 40 s length. On the single participant level, several subjects exhibited some synchrony between the heart cycle and the time reproduction responses, most pronounced for the time interval of 25 s (8 out of 23 participants for 20% quantile). Better time reproduction accuracy was not related with larger degree of phase locking, but with greater vagal control of the heart. A higher interoceptive sensitivity (IS) was associated with a higher synchronization index (SI) for the 2 s time interval only. We conclude that information obtained from the cardiac cycle is relevant for the encoding and reproduction of time in the time span of 2-25 s.

To address this idea in the current study, we examined the relationship between IAcc and long-term stress, which was assessed with different questionnaires and biological markers, including cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Furthermore, we investigated self-regulation as a mechanism linking IAcc to long-term stress. The sample consisted of 98 participants. To measure IAcc, participants completed the heartbeat perception task. Perceived long-term stress and self-regulation were assessed via an online questionnaire. Moreover, hair samples were taken from 65 participants to determine long-term stress with cortisol and DHEA as well as the ratio of both. Results showed that IAcc was positively related to DHEA and weakly negatively related to the other indicators of long-term stress, except for the nonsignificant relationships to the indicators cortisol and stress experiences due to negative events. Furthermore, these relationships were mediated by participants' enhanced self-regulation.

Cardiac interoception: A novel signal detection approach and relations to somatic symptom distress,"Pohl, A.; Hums, A. C.; Kraft, G.; Koteles, F.; Gerlach, A. L.; Witthoft, M.","Interoception is essential for the maintenance of physical and mental health. Paradigms assessing cardioceptive accuracy do not separate sensitivity from bias or are very demanding. We present the piloting (study 1; N = 60) and psychometric evaluation and validation (study 2; N = 84) of a novel task for the assessment of cardiac interoceptive perception following the principles of signal detection theory. By disentangling sensitivity and response bias, we demonstrate that the previously used interoceptive accuracy score of the heartbeat mental tracking task represents an amalgam of sensitivity and response bias. The new task demonstrated adequate test-retest reliabilities for sensitivity (d') and response bias (c). Sensitivity was inversely related (beta = -.36) to somatic symptom distress after statistically controlling for response bias. The novel cardiovascular signal detection task is easy to implement, feasible, and promising in terms of unraveling the role of (cardiac) interoceptive perception in psychopathology.

Interoceptive deficits in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy,"Schultchen, D.; Zaudig, M.; Krauseneck, T.; Berberich, G.; Pollatos, O.","Interoception is impaired in different psychiatric disorders and is also associated with emotions. Only one study could show a higher interoceptive accuracy (IAcc) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Based on the predictive coding system we assume contrary results, indicating a decreased IAcc in patients with OCD. So far, there is no study investigating the effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy on IAcc in patients with OCD. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with OCD improve their IAcc during the time course of therapy compared to healthy controls. Twenty-six patients with OCD from the Psychosomatic Clinic in Windach were examined in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. They were compared to 26 matched healthy controls. IAcc via the heartbeat perception task as well as questionnaire data (OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms) were assessed. Results showed that IAcc, OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms were attenuated in patients with OCD. Patients recovered in the time course of therapy regarding OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms. Interoceptive deficits did not change in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. We demonstrated that IAcc is affected in patients with OCD and this deficit does not change during the time course of a standardized therapy. Future studies should investigate, whether an inaccuracy in perceiving one's bodily signals constitutes a risk factor for relapse. Further, it could be examined if IAcc can be increased via self- and body focus interventions in patients with OCD.",2019,2019/05/24,PLOS ONE,14,5,e0217237,31125377.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0217237,,#1098,Schultchen 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Improving interoceptive ability through the practice of power posing: A pilot study,"Weineck, F.; Messner, M.; Hauke, G.; Pollatos, O.","Interoception refers to the detection and perception of signals from the inner body. Deficits in this domain have been linked to psychopathologies, prompting the search for strategies to improve this ability. Preliminary studies have shown that interoception could be enhanced through the manipulation of subjective feelings of power. We tested the effects of adopting powerful postures on different facets of interoception. Firstly, we measured the impact of a single power posing session on interoceptive ability in 41 healthy females. Then, the same participants were randomly assigned to two conditions (daily power posing practice vs. no practice). After one week the conditions alternated. Interoceptive accuracy, measured by the heartbeat tracking task, interoceptive sensibility, measured by the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) and confidence ratings, as well as subjective feelings of power were assessed at baseline, after a single power posing session and after one week of training. A single power posing session significantly increased individuals' interoceptive accuracy. Also, power posing reduced individuals' scores on the BPQ after one week of daily practice and increased subjective feelings of power after one session and one week of daily practice. These findings suggest that adopting powerful postures has the potential to increase interoceptive accuracy, as well as subjective feelings of power, and to reduce interoceptive sensibility, measured by questionnaire.",2019,2019/02/07,PLOS ONE,14,2,e0211453,30730938.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0211453,,#1099,Weineck 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

We assessed IAc in 59 healthy participants (40 women, M(Age) = 23.4 years) on three consecutive measurement occasions, approximately 1 week apart, in a rest and poststress condition, using a heartbeat counting and a heartbeat discrimination task. The results showed fair temporal stability (intraclass correlation coefficients >/= 0.38) and good reliability (Mdn = .63; range .49-.83) for both methods. While around 40% of the variance of a single IAc measurement could be explained by a trait, approximately 27% was accounted for by occasion-specific effects of situation and person-situation interaction.

Cue and context conditioning to respiratory threat: Effects of suffocation fear and implications for the etiology of panic disorder,"Benke, C.; Alius, M. G.; Hamm, A. O.; Pane-Farre, C. A.","Interoceptive threats play a crucial role in the etiology of panic disorder (PD). While body sensations may become conditioned stimuli (CS) when paired with such interoceptive threats (cue conditioning), the environment in which such interoceptive threats occur may also be learned as a predictor of threat (context conditioning). Suffocation fear (SF) might facilitate these associative learning processes if threats of suffocation become relevant as unconditioned stimuli (US). To investigate whether SF affects associative learning during such respiratory threat, we used mild dyspnea as CS that predicted the occurrence of strong dyspnea (US) in one context (predictable), was not related to the occurrence of the US in another context (unpredictable) or was presented in a different context (safe) in which no US was delivered. Startle eyeblink responses and subjective reports were assessed in 34 participants during learning. Individuals reporting high SF showed a clear potentiation of the startle response during the interoceptive CS predicting the occurrence of interoceptive threat (US). Such startle potentiation was not observed when the CS remained unpaired (safe or unpredictable context). Moreover, high SF persons also showed a significant startle potentiation to the threatening context, when the CS did not predict the onset of the US. No such learning effects were observed for low SF individuals. The data support the view that defensive response mobilization can be triggered by cues but also by contexts that predict the occurrence of interoceptive threats if these threats are relevant for the individuals, supporting learning accounts for the development of PD.",2018,Feb,Int J Psychophysiol,124,,33-42,29330006.0,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2018.01.002,,#1101,Benke 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Interpersonal Subtypes and Therapy Response in Patients Treated for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Konig, J.; Onnen, M.; Karl, R.; Rosner, R.; Butollo, W.","Interpersonal traits may influence psychotherapy success. One way of conceptualizing such traits is the interpersonal circumplex model. In this study, we analyse interpersonal circumplex data, assessed with the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (Horowitz, Strauss, & Kordy, 1994) from a randomized study with 138 patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder after trauma in adulthood. The study compared cognitive processing therapy and dialogical exposure therapy, a Gestalt-based intervention. We divided the interpersonally heterogeneous sample according to the quadrants of the interpersonal circumplex. The division into quadrants yielded subgroups that did not differ in their general psychological distress, but the cold-submissive quadrant tended to exhibit higher posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity and interpersonal distress than the other three. There was also a trend for patients in different quadrants to be affected differently by the treatments. Correlation analyses supported these results: in cognitive processing therapy, more dominant patients had more successful therapies, while in dialogical exposure therapy, success was not correlated with interpersonal style. Results indicate that especially patients with cold interpersonal styles profited differentially from the two treatments offered. Dividing samples according to the interpersonal circumplex quadrants seems promising. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Interpersonal traits may contribute to psychotherapy outcome. Dividing the sample according to the quadrants of the interpersonal circumplex, as opposed to cluster analysis, yielded promising results.

A rare scare: The role of intolerance of uncertainty in startle responses and event-related potentials in anticipation of unpredictable threat,"Carsten, H. P.; Harpfer, K.; Riesel, A.","Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) represents a transdiagnostic risk factor for internalizing psychopathology. However, little is known regarding its psychophysiological correlates. IU is thought to render individuals hypersensitive to threatening events, even if the occurrence probability is low. To test this, we recruited 90 students who completed two NPU-threat tests separating temporal unpredictability from probabilistic unpredictability (i.e., probability of occurrence): First, a NPU version in which the timing of threat (i.e., shock) was either predictable or unpredictable but the shock probability was 100 % in each trial. Second, a probabilistic NPU version in which the timing of the shock was also either predictable or unpredictable, but the shock probability was 33 % in each trial. Startle reflex, event-related potentials N1 and P3 locked to auditory startle probes, and anxiety ratings were analyzed. As expected, temporally unpredictable threat modulated startle, N1, and anxiety ratings. IU predicted increased startle to lower shock probability, regardless of the temporal predictability. No evidence emerged for IU affecting N1 or P3. However, IU predicted anxiety ratings to threat conditions regardless of temporal or probabilistic predictability. Individual differences in IU shape startle responses to eventual threat: IU increases automatic defensive responding to unpredictable and potentially threatening situations if the threat probability is low. Individuals with higher IU may tend to ""err on the side of caution"" with a mismatch between physiological preparation and threat probability, such that the effects of IU are particularly observable in low threat probability conditions.",2022,Sep,Int J Psychophysiol,179,,56-66,35787439.0,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2022.06.018,,#1104,Carsten 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
[Measurement of pain-related experiential avoidance: analysis of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II-Pain in patients with chronic pain],"Majeed, R.; Faust, I.; Huppe, M.; Hermann, C.","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Experiential avoidance is a core process variable in the concept of Acceptance and Commitment Theory (ACT) and has been connected to various disorders. A widely used instrument for the measurement of experiential avoidance is the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQ-II). Recently, a pain-specific version for chronic pain patients was introduced in the Netherlands (AAQ-II‑P). High scores indicate strong pain-related experiential avoidance. The aim of the current study was to measure pain-related experiential avoidance in a sample of chronic pain patients using the German translation of the AAQ-II‑P and to analyze its psychometric qualities. METHODS: After a forward-backward translation procedure of the AAQ-II and adaptation to the pain context, a sample of N = 168 patients from a multidisciplinary pain center answered the German version of the AAQ-II‑P. Additional questionnaires were administered to measure specific constructs of interest: chronic pain grade (CPG), pain catastrophizing (PCS), health-related quality of life (SF-12), psychopathology (HADS-D), personality (BFI‑K) and mindfulness (KIMS-S). Reliability, factorial validity and construct validity of the AAQ-II‑P were identified. RESULTS: The AAQ-II‑P had high internal consistency (alpha = 0.89) and the one-factor solution explained 61% of the total variance. Correlations to personality and mindfulness subscales were low (maxima: r = 0.44 with neuroticism and r = -0.43 with acceptance). High correlations were shown for catastrophizing (r = 0.75), depression (r = 0.73) and anxiety (r = 0.66). Also, there was a substantial correlation to health-related quality of life, specifically the psychological total scale (r = -0.58). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The German AAQ-II‑P has good reliability. Regarding factorial structure and construct validity, it is highly comparable to the original version. Direction and magnitude of the relationship to adjacent constructs mostly measure up to our expectations. Chronic pain patients inclined to pain-related experiential avoidance tend to indicate more pain catastrophizing and show restricted quality of life regarding psychological variables. Apparently, pain-related experiential avoidance can be relevant for popular target variables in psychotherapy.",2021,Dec,Schmerz,35,6,401-411,33580414.0,10.1007/s00482-021-00537-6,,#1106,Majeed 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Treatment of acquired patella baja by proximalization tibial tubercle osteotomy significantly improved knee joint function but overall patient-reported outcome measures remain diminished after two to four years of follow-up,"Schmidt, S.; Mengis, N.; Rippke, J. N.; Zimmermann, F.; Milinkovic, D. D.; Balcarek, P.","INTRODUCTION: Acquired patella baja is often characterized by painful limitation of knee joint range of motion and anterior knee pain (AKP). Only few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of surgical treatment in terms of patient-reported outcome measures (PROM's) and sports activity. Thus, the goal of this study was to assess PROM's and sports activity after proximalization tibial tubercle osteotomy (P-TTO) in patients with symptomatic patella baja. METHODS: Between 2016 and 2018, a case series of 11 patients (male/female 4/7; age 48 +/- 12 years) were treated by P-TTO and were retrospectively evaluated after a mean of 33.7 months (range 24-51 months). The Tegner activity score and the Kujala anterior knee pain scale were used in addition to a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0-10) regarding self-reported knee joint function and intensity of AKP. Radiographic assessment included the measure of patellar height using the Caton-Deschamps (CD) and Blackburne-Peel (BP) index. RESULTS: Postoperatively both the CD and the BP index increased to normality (p < 0.0001; p = 0.0012). Knee joint flexion improved from 100 +/- 32 degrees preoperatively to 123 +/- 14 degrees postoperatively (p = 0.0235). AKP decreased from 6.5 +/- 2.1 points preoperatively to 3.7 +/- 2.1 points postoperatively (p = 0.0061). This was accompanied by a significant increase in self-reported knee joint function from 1.8 +/- 1.2 points preoperatively to 6.8 +/- 2.3 points postoperatively (p = 0.0001) and an increase of the Tegner activity score from 1.8 +/- 1.6 points preoperatively to 3.9 +/- 1.5 points postoperatively (p = 0.0074). Although the Kujala score improved significantly by an average of 31.55 points (p = 0.001) overall score results remained reduced at 65.6 +/- 17.9 points at final follow-up. CONCLUSION: P-TTO yielded significant improvements in terms of AKP, subjective knee joint function and sports activity. However, the overall Kujala score results remained reduced, indicating that surgical correction of patellar height is not sufficient to relieve all patients' complaints. In addition, the incidence of postoperative complications was high.",2022,Oct,Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,142,10,2481-2487,33730219.0,10.1007/s00402-021-03863-7,,#1107,Schmidt 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Long-Term Consequences of Childhood Maltreatment Among Postpartum Women-Prevalence of Psychosocial Risk Factors for Child Welfare: An Independent Replication Study,"Hitzler, M.; Bach, A. M.; Kohler-Dauner, F.; Gundel, H.; Kolassa, I. T.","INTRODUCTION: As an especially burdensome experience, childhood maltreatment (CM) can have lifelong consequences on the mental health and wellbeing of an individual well into adulthood. We have previously reported that CM constitutes a central risk factor not only for the development of mental problems, but also for facing additional psychosocial risks, endangering healthy development of mother and offspring throughout life (e.g., financial problems, intimate partner violence, substance use). This study was designed to replicate these findings in a larger, independent study cohort. METHOD: In this cross-sectional replication study an independent cohort of 533 healthy postpartum women was interviewed within seven days after parturition. CM experiences were assessed retrospectively using the German version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and current psychosocial risk factors for child welfare were assessed using the Konstanzer Index (KINDEX). RESULTS: Of all women, 16.1% experienced emotional and 10.1% physical abuse, 28.5% emotional neglect, 9.4% physical neglect and 10.3% experienced sexual abuse. Most importantly, the higher the CM load the more psychosocial stressors existed in women's life. In Particular, women with higher CM load had a higher risk for mental health problems, intimate partner violence, financial problems, and a higher postnatal stress load. CONCLUSIONS: In an independent sample, this study replicated the previous findings that CM and psychosocial risk factors for child welfare were strongly associated in a dose-response manner. Our results emphasize the higher vulnerability of women with a CM history in the postpartum period. To avoid negative consequences for mother and child, a regular and evidence-based screening for CM and psychosocial risk factors during pregnancy and puerperium is needed to identify at-risk mothers early during pregnancy and to provide appropriate support. Hence, our findings highlight the mandatory requirement for an interdisciplinary collaboration of gynecological practices, hospitals and midwifes, along with psychologists and psychotherapists and child and youth welfare services.",2022,2022/03/14,Front Psychiatry,13,,836077,35360143.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.836077,,#1110,Hitzler 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"Unprotected Intercourse and One-Night Stands: Impact of Sexual Excitation, Sexual Inhibition, and Atypical Sexual Arousal Patterns on Risky Sexual Behaviors in Women","Velten, J.; Scholten, S.; Graham, C. A.; Margraf, J.","INTRODUCTION: Associations among sexual excitation, sexual inhibition, atypical sexual arousal patterns, and risky sexual behaviors have been reported in studies involving men and women. To date, longitudinal studies have not evaluated the predictive value of these propensities for future sexual behaviors in women. AIM: To investigate associations among sexual excitation, sexual inhibition, atypical sexual arousal patterns, and potentially risky sexual behaviors in women. METHODS: Overall, 2,214 women (mean age = 30.65 years, standard deviation = 9.91 years) participated in a baseline Web-based survey. The 1- and 2-year follow-up surveys included 396 and 382 participants, respectively. Correlational analyses and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to analyze the relations between predictor and outcome variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of partners, number of one-time sexual encounters, and number of partners with whom no condoms were used during the 12-month periods before each of the three data assessment points. RESULTS: All five lower-order factors of sexual excitation showed positive correlations and all three lower-order factors of sexual inhibition showed negative correlations with outcomes at baseline and follow-up. Atypical sexual arousal patterns, the tendency to become aroused in unusual sexual situations, and the importance of relationship factors, such as trust, for sexual arousal were the strongest predictors for sexual behaviors at baseline. These variables also predicted the number of sexual partners and the number of one-night stands at follow-up. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that increased sexual arousal when experiencing negative mood might be a risk factor for potentially health-threatening sexual decisions and support the assumptions of the dual control model that sexual excitation is positively and sexual inhibition is negatively predictive of risky sexual behavior in women.",2016,Mar,J Sex Med,13,3,361-73,26803457.0,10.1016/j.jsxm.2015.12.027,,#1111,Velten 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Configural processing of emotional bodies and faces in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Thoma, P.; Soria Bauser, D.; Edel, M. A.; Juckel, G.; Suchan, B.","Introduction: Attention Deficit Disorder (ADHD) is associated with interpersonal problems and difficulties in inferring other peoples' emotions. Previous research has focused on face processing, mostly in children. Our study investigated configural processing of emotional bodies and faces in adults with ADHD in comparison with healthy controls, analyzing P100, N170 and P250 event-related potentials (ERPs) and relating them to (socio)cognitive functioning. Method: Nineteen patients with ADHD and 25 healthy controls were presented upright and inverted bodies and faces which had to be categorized as neutral, happy or angry while ERPs were recorded. Additionally, sociocognitive and executive functioning was assessed. Results: In ADHD patients relative to controls, recognition of emotions depicted by bodies but not by faces was impaired and P100 amplitudes were enhanced for angry bodies. Furthermore, patients showed enhanced P250 amplitudes in response to both bodies and faces, specifically for happy and neutral emotions. Larger N170 amplitudes to bodies and faces correlated with lower alexithymia scores only in controls, while enhanced P250 amplitudes to both categories were associated with poorer inhibition only in patients. Conclusion: Adults with ADHD show potentially compensatory enhanced semantic processing of emotional bodies and faces, as reflected by increased P250 amplitudes, associated with poorer executive functioning and subtle alterations of emotional and configural processing, as reflected by ERPs.",2020,Dec,J Clin Exp Neuropsychol,42,10,1028-1048,33161842.0,10.1080/13803395.2020.1840521,,#1112,Thoma 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Fostering coping as a mechanism of symptom change in cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis,"Schlier, B.; Ludwig, L.; Wiesjahn, M.; Jung, E.; Lincoln, T. M.","INTRODUCTION: Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) has been repeatedly shown to ameliorate psychotic symptoms. However, so far we have little understanding of the mechanisms of change in CBTp. In this study, we tested whether improved cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage taxing external or internal demands (=coping) constitute a mechanism of change in CBTp. METHODS: Using data from a published trial for a secondary analysis, we tested whether the continuous symptomatic improvement of patients (n = 57) who received up to 45 sessions of CBTp and completed weekly self-assessments of symptoms (suspiciousness, individualised positive and negative symptoms, and individualised symptoms of depression) was mediated by preceding improvement in self-assessed coping using multilevel analysis. A reverse model in which symptom improvement predicted improved coping was also tested. RESULTS: Continuous improvement in suspiciousness, negative symptoms, and depression over the course of CBTp was preceded by improvement in coping. Improvement in suspiciousness or positive symptoms did not predict subsequent improvement in coping, whereas improvement in negative symptoms and depression predicted subsequent improvement in coping. CONCLUSION: Coping constitutes a mechanism of change, albeit to a different extent for different symptom clusters. Further research needs to explore how best to utilise this mechanism and optimise its integration with other active ingredients of CBTp to maximise therapeutic gain.",2020,Jan,Schizophr Res,215,,416-423,31481336.0,10.1016/j.schres.2019.07.047,,#1119,Schlier 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Assessing the attentional bias of smokers in a virtual reality anti-saccade task using eye tracking,"Schroder, B.; Muhlberger, A.","INTRODUCTION: Cognitive biases (among them attentional bias, AB) are considered an important factor in the development, maintenance, and recurrence of addiction. However, traditional paradigms to measure AB have been criticized regarding external validity and methodical issues. Therefore, and because the neurophysiological correlates of anti-saccade tasks are known, we implemented a novel smoking anti-saccade task in virtual reality (VR) to measure AB and inhibitory control in different contexts and with higher ecological validity. METHODS: Smokers (n = 20) and non-smokers (n = 20) were tested on a classic pro- and anti-saccade task, a VR anti-saccade task and a VR attention fixation task (all containing smoking-related and neutral stimuli) while eye-tracking data was collected. Two VR contexts (park and office room) were applied. RESULTS: Saccade latencies were significantly higher for the smoking group in the VR anti-saccade task. However, this effect did not differ between smoking-related and neutral stimuli, thus overall no AB was observed. Instead, AB was only present in the park context. Additionally, saccade latencies and error rates were significantly higher in the park context. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate impaired inhibitory control in smokers relative to non-smokers. The lack of evidence for a general AB might be due to the lower severity of smoking dependence in the smoking sample. Instead, results suggest context specificity of AB. Implications for smoking cessation interventions in the field of inhibitory control training and attention bias modification are discussed.",2022,Jul,Biol Psychol,172,,108381,35710075.0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2022.108381,,#1120,Schroder 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Effectiveness of Individual Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy and Predictors of Outcome in Adult Patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"Kathmann, N.; Jacobi, T.; Elsner, B.; Reuter, B.","INTRODUCTION: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has proven its efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). OBJECTIVE: To test generalizability to routine care settings, we conducted an effectiveness study to provide naturalistic outcome data and their predictors. METHODS: Pre-post changes in symptoms and impairment as well as response rates were determined in a naturalistic OCD sample (intention-to-treat, ITT, n = 393). Patients received individual CBT for OCD adopting an exposure-based, non-manualized treatment format. Linear and logistic regression analyses were applied to identify associations of sociodemographic and clinical variables with symptom change. RESULTS: Effect size in ITT patients amounted to d = 1.47 in primary outcome (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, Y-BOCS). Remission rates were 46.3% (ITT), 52.0% (completers), and 18.2% (non-completers). The rates of treatment response without remission, no change, and deterioration in the ITT sample were 13.2, 38, and 3%, respectively. Initial symptom severity, comorbid personality disorder, and unemployment were associated with a poorer outcome, and previous medication with a better outcome. Comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders as well as other clinical or sociodemographic variables showed no effects on symptom change. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes in this large observational trial in a naturalistic setting correspond to available RCT findings suggesting that CBT for OCD should be strongly recommended for dissemination in routine care.

Factorial validity was investigated through a unidimensional confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Moreover, internal consistency, convergent validity (correlations with the other measured constructs) and criterion validity (suicidality) were examined. RESULTS: One residual correlation between 2 items that are inversely coded had to be allowed to reach a satisfying fit to the unidimensional model (RMSEA=0.077, TLI=0.94, NFI=0.93, CFI=0.95; item loadings>0.56). The DS-d-sumscore correlated highly with depression (r=0.87), Entrapment (r=0.83) and suicidality (r=0.70), and moderately with the other constructs. Participants with suicidal thoughts or behavior in the past showed higher DS-d-scores than participants without suicidality. DISCUSSION: The unidimensional structure of the English version could be confirmed in the DS-d - after allowing for a residual correlation between two inversely coded items. Correlations with the other measured constructs give support for the validity of the DS-d. Criterion validity of the instrument is supported by its relations to suicidality. It remains open whether defeat and entrapment are 2 distinct constructs. In the current study - in accordance with the literature - both showed a very high intercorrelation. CONCLUSION: This study reports on the validation of a German version of the Defeat-Scale (DS-d) for the first time that shows good psychometric characteristics in terms of internal consistency and validity.",2018,Jul,Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol,68,7,300-308,28718867.0,10.1055/s-0043-107027,,#1122,Forkmann 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Blended Care in In-Patient Acute Psychiatric Care. The Example of a Group Training for Social Competences in Adults-A Pretest-Posttest Feasibility Study,"Bendig, E.; Kuchler, A. M.; Baumeister, H.; Becker, T.","INTRODUCTION: Deficits in social skills can be an important modulating factor in the development and progress of various mental disorders. However, limited resources in inpatient care often impede effective social skills training. This study investigates the feasibility of a blended group training for social skills (SST) in an inpatient psychiatric setting. Methods and Analysis: For this one-group pretest-posttest trial, inpatients with a diagnosed mental disorder were recruited. Participation in the blended SST lasted four weeks and took place within usual inpatient psychiatric care. The blended intervention comprised four face-to-face group sessions and three complementary online modules within four weeks. Assessments took place before (t1) and after (t2) the training. Feasibility outcomes (use, acceptance, satisfaction, implementability into usual psychiatric inpatient care) and effectiveness outcomes regarding social skills were assessed. RESULTS: N = 15 participants were recruited. Most patients completed all questionnaires (93%) and all modules of the blended SST concept (60%). All participants (100%) would recommend the blended intervention to a friend. Regarding social skills, exploratory analyses revealed a non-significant medium-sized effect (Cohen's d = 0.5 95%CI 0.3 to 1.25, p = 0.08). DISCUSSION: This trial shows that a blended care SST is feasible for the use in acute psychiatric inpatient care setting. Although the wards were acute, with high turnover and change of inpatients, 60% of participants were treated per protocol over four weeks. Overall, the evidence on blended care concepts in psychiatric care settings is extremely poor to date. Hence, this trial should encourage intensified blended inpatient psychiatric care research.",2021,Sep 7,Int J Environ Res Public Health,18,18,9433,34574357.0,10.3390/ijerph18189433,,#1123,Bendig 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Evaluation of a Stepped Care Approach to Manage Depression and Diabetes Distress in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial (ECCE HOMO Study),"Schmitt, A.; Kulzer, B.; Reimer, A.; Herder, C.; Roden, M.; Haak, T.; Hermanns, N.","INTRODUCTION: Depression is a common and serious complication of diabetes. Treatment approaches addressing the specific demands of affected patients are scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to test whether a stepped care approach for patients with diabetes and depression and/or diabetes distress yields greater depression reduction than treatment-as-usual. METHODS: Two-hundred and sixty patients with diabetes and elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D >/=16) and/or elevated diabetes distress (PAID >/=40) were randomized to stepped care for depression or diabetes treatment-as-usual. The primary outcome was the rate of meaningful depression reduction at the 12-month follow-up according to the HAMD (score <9 or reduction by >/=50%). Secondary outcomes were changes in depression scores (HAMD/CES-D), diabetes distress (PAID), diabetes acceptance (AADQ), well-being (WHO-5), quality of life (EQ-5D/SF-36), self-care behavior (SDSCA/DSMQ), HbA1c, and biomarkers of inflammation. RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-one individuals were assigned to stepped care and 129 to treatment-as-usual. Overall, 15.4% were lost to follow-up. Meaningful depression reduction was observed in 80.2 versus 51.2% in stepped care versus treatment-as-usual (p < 0.001, intention-to-treat analysis). Of the secondary measures, the HAMD (∆ -3.2, p < 0.001), WHO-5 (∆ 1.5, p = 0.007), and AADQ (∆ -1.0, p = 0.008) displayed significant treatment effects, while effects on CES-D (∆ -2.3, p = 0.065), PAID (∆ -3.5, p = 0.109), and SDSCA (∆ 0.20, p = 0.081) were not significantly different. Both groups showed comparable changes in EQ-5D/SF-36, DSMQ, HbA1c, and biomarkers of inflammation (all p >/= 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: The stepped care approach improved depression, well-being, and acceptance. The results support that increasing treatment intensity on demand is effective and can help provide more optimal treatment.

Internet-Based Guided Self-Help for Vaginal Penetration Difficulties: Results of a Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,"Zarski, A. C.; Berking, M.; Fackiner, C.; Rosenau, C.; Ebert, D. D.","INTRODUCTION: Difficulties with vaginal penetration can severely affect a woman's desire to have sexual intercourse, her sexual and general well-being, or her partnership. However, treatment opportunities for vaginismus are scarce. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based guided self-help intervention for vaginismus in a randomized controlled pilot trial. METHODS: Seventy-seven women with vaginismus (primary inclusion criterion = no intercourse >/= 6 months) were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) and a waitlist control group (WCG). The intervention consisted of 10 sessions involving psychoeducation, relaxation exercises, sensate focus, and gradual exposure with dilators. Participants received written feedback on completed sessions from an eCoach. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was successful sexual intercourse. Secondary outcomes were non-intercourse penetration, fear of coitus, sexual functioning, and dyadic coping. Self-reported assessments were scheduled at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months. RESULTS: More participants (10 of 40, 34.48%) in the IG had intercourse compared with those in the WCG (6 of 37, 20.69%) at least once at 10 weeks or 6 months (odds ratio = 2.02). The difference was not significant (chi(2)(1) = 1.38, P = .38), but in the IG, there was a significant increase in intercourse penetration from baseline to 6 months (d = 0.65). No such increase was found in the WCG (d = 0.21). There were significant between-group effects concerning non-intercourse penetration (self-insertion of a finger or dilator or insertion by the partner) in favor of the IG. Fear of coitus and dyadic coping significantly decreased in the IG. Overall satisfaction with the training was high. CONCLUSION: This randomized controlled trial showed promising effects of an internet-based intervention by increasing participants' ability to have intercourse and non-intercourse penetration while experiencing high treatment satisfaction. The WCG also showed improvement, although participants had vaginismus for an average duration of 6 years. Internet-based interventions could be a treatment modality to complement other methods in stepped care for vaginal penetration difficulties.",2017,Feb,J Sex Med,14,2,238-254,28161080.0,10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.12.232,,#1126,Zarski 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The Effects of Modifying Dysfunctional Appraisals in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Using a Form of Cognitive Bias Modification: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial in an Inpatient Setting,"Woud, M. L.; Blackwell, S. E.; Shkreli, L.; Wurtz, F.; Cwik, J. C.; Margraf, J.; Holmes, E. A.; Steudte-Schmiedgen, S.; Herpertz, S.; Kessler, H.","INTRODUCTION: Dysfunctional appraisals about traumatic events and their sequelae are a key mechanism in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Experimental studies have shown that a computerized cognitive training, cognitive bias modification for appraisals (CBM-APP), can modify dysfunctional appraisals and reduce analogue trauma symptoms amongst healthy and subclinical volunteers. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test whether CBM-APP could reduce dysfunctional appraisals related to trauma reactions in PTSD patients, and whether this would lead to improvements in PTSD symptoms. METHODS: We compared CBM-APP to sham training in a parallel-arm proof-of-principle double-blind randomized controlled trial amongst 80 PTSD patients admitted to an inpatient clinic. Both arms comprised a training schedule of 8 sessions over a 2-week period and were completed as an adjunct to the standard treatment programme. RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses, participants receiving CBM-APP showed a greater reduction in dysfunctional appraisals on a scenario task from pre- to posttraining (primary outcome) assessments, compared to those receiving sham training (d = 1.30, 95% CI 0.82-1.80), with between-group differences also found on the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI; d = 0.85, 95% CI 0.39-1.32) and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; d = 0.68, 95% CI 0.23-1.14), but not for long-term cortisol concentrations (d = 0.25, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.78). Reductions in dysfunctional appraisals assessed via the scenario task correlated with reductions on the PTCI, PCL-5, and hair cortisol concentrations from pre- to posttraining time points. CONCLUSIONS: Results support dysfunctional appraisals as a modifiable cognitive mechanism, and that their proximal modification transfers to downstream PTSD symptoms. These findings could open new avenues for improving present therapeutic approaches.",2021,,Psychother Psychosom,90,6,386-402,33621970.0,10.1159/000514166,,#1127,Woud 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Autonomic arousal during psychosis spectrum experiences: Results from a high resolution ambulatory assessment study over the course of symptom on- and offset,"Schlier, B.; Krkovic, K.; Clamor, A.; Lincoln, T. M.","INTRODUCTION: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies show that stressors trigger the onset or increase of psychotic symptoms. These studies, however, predominantly rely on large sampling intervals and self-report assessment. This study aims to identify the autonomic stress-response to psychosis-spectrum experiences by using a one-day high-resolution EMA with continuous skin conductance and heart rate monitoring in a sample with attenuated positive symptoms. METHODS: Sixty-two participants were equipped with a smartphone and wearable sensors to monitor skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate variability (HRV) for 24 h. Every 20 min, participants answered questions on current stress, hallucination spectrum experiences (HSE), and paranoia. Sampling intervals were categorized into no event, pre-onset, event, pre-offset, and post-offset phases. We contrasted stress, SCL, and HRV between phases using multilevel regression models of sampling intervals nested in participants. RESULTS: For paranoia, we found alterations in the autonomic and self-reported stress response prior to the onset that persisted until the episodes had ended. For HSE, we found no effects. Exploratory separate analyses of the different items aggregated into HSE yielded diverging results for intrusive thoughts, perceptual sensitivity, and hallucinations. CONCLUSION: Physiological parameters are sensitive indicators of the onset of paranoia, which holds implications for preventive mobile interventions. To further explore the autonomic stress-response associated with HSE, further studies of the different HSE are needed.",2019,Oct,Schizophr Res,212,,163-170,31422861.0,10.1016/j.schres.2019.07.046,,#1128,Schlier 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Embitterment as a Specific Mental Health Reaction during the Coronavirus Pandemic,"Muschalla, B.; Vollborn, C.; Sondhof, A.","INTRODUCTION: Embitterment can occur as a reaction to perceived injustice. During the pandemic and restrictions in daily living due to infection risk management, a range of many smaller or severe injustices have occurred. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate what characterizes persons with high embitterment, mental illness, embitterment and mental illness, and those without embitterment or mental health problems. METHODS: We conducted an online survey including persons from the general population in November 2020 and December 2020, the phase during which a second lockdown took place, with closed shops, restaurants, cultural and activity sites. 3,208 participants (mean age 47 years) gave self-ratings on their present well-being, burdens experienced during the pandemic, embitterment, wisdom, and resilience. RESULTS: Embitterment occurred among 16% of the sample, which is a high rate in comparison with 4% during pre-pandemic times. Embitterment was weakly correlated with unspecific mental well-being. There were more persons with embitterment than those with embitterment and a mental health problem. Persons with embitterment reported less coronavirus-related anxiety than persons without embitterment. However, embittered persons reported more social and economic burdens and more frequent experiences of losses (job loss and canceling of medical treatments). Embittered persons perceive their own wisdom competencies on a similar level as persons with mental health problems or persons without mental health problems. CONCLUSION: Embitterment is a specific potentially alone-standing affective state, which is distinguishable from general mental health and coping capacities (here: wisdom). The economic and social consequences of pandemic management should be carefully recognized and prevented by policy.",2021,,Psychopathology,54,5,232-241,34320511.0,10.1159/000517447,,#1129,Muschalla 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Does cognitive behavior therapy alter emotion regulation in inpatients with a depressive disorder?,"Forkmann, T.; Scherer, A.; Pawelzik, M.; Mainz, V.; Drueke, B.; Boecker, M.; Gauggel, S.","INTRODUCTION: Emotion regulation plays an important role in the development and treatment of depression. The present study investigated whether the emotion regulation strategies, expressive suppression (ES) and cognitive reappraisal (CR) change in the course of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) of depressive inpatients. Furthermore, it also examined whether changes in CR and ES correlated with positive treatment outcomes. METHODS: Forty-four inpatients from a psychotherapeutic hospital who suffered from a depressive disorder (mean age =36.4 years, standard deviation =13.4 years; 63.6% female) filled in the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory at admission and discharge. To detect changes in emotion regulation, and depression across treatment, data were analyzed using multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) for repeated measures, effect sizes, and Spearman correlations. A P-value of </=0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Depression severity (F[1]=10.42, P=0.003; eta(2) =0.22) and CR (F[1]=4.71, P=0.04; eta(2) =0.11) changed significantly across CBT treatment. ES remained virtually stable. Post-treatment scores of CR were also positively correlated with reduction in depressive symptoms across treatment (rho=0.30, P=0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that CBT affects emotion regulation in depressive inpatients only for CR and that higher post-treatment scores in CR were related to greater reduction in depressive symptoms across treatment.",2014,2014/05,Psychol Res Behav Manag,7,,147-53,24872725.0,10.2147/PRBM.S59421,,#1132,Forkmann 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Telephone coaching for the prevention of depression in farmers: Results from a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Thielecke, J.; Buntrock, C.; Titzler, I.; Braun, L.; Freund, J.; Berking, M.; Baumeister, H.; Ebert, D. D.","INTRODUCTION: Farmers have a high risk for depression (MDD). Preventive measures targeting this often remotely living population might reduce depression burden. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized telephone coaching in reducing depressive symptom severity and preventing MDD in farmers compared to enhanced treatment as usual (TAU + ). METHODS: In a two-armed, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (N = 314) with post-treatment at 6 months, farming entrepreneurs, collaborating family members and pensioners with elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 >/= 5) were randomized to personalized telephone coaching or TAU + . The coaching was provided by psychologists and consists on average of 13 (+/-7) sessions a 48 min (+/-15) over 6 months. The primary outcome was depressive symptom severity (QIDS-SR16). RESULTS: Coaching participants showed a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptom severity compared to TAU + (d = 0.39). Whereas reliable symptom deterioration was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to TAU + , no significant group differences were found for reliable improvement and in depression onset. Further significant effects in favor of the intervention group were found for stress (d = 0.34), anxiety (d = 0.30), somatic symptoms (d = 0.39), burnout risk (d = 0.24-0.40) and quality of life (d = 0.28). DISCUSSION: Limiting, we did not apply an upper cutoff score for depressive symptom severity or controlled for previous MDD episodes, leaving open whether the coaching was recurrence/relapse prevention or early treatment. Nevertheless, personalized telephone coaching can effectively improve mental health in farmers. It could play an important role in intervening at an early stage of mental health problems and reducing disease burden related to MDD.

Imaginal Retraining Reduces Craving for Tobacco in 1-Year Controlled Follow-Up Study,"Gehlenborg, J.; Goritz, A. S.; Moritz, S.; Ludtke, T.; Kuhn, S.","INTRODUCTION: Imaginal retraining is a self-help technique that adapts the principles of approach bias modification to the imagination. Imaginal retraining has been shown to reduce craving and addictive behaviours in 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on problematic alcohol consumption, overweight, and tobacco use. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the long-term efficacy of the intervention. The aim of the present study was to generate first hypotheses on the long-term efficacy of imaginal retraining in smokers in a controlled 1-year follow-up study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recontacted the 345 participants who had taken part in an RCT on imaginal retraining for smokers 1 year later. The survey was carried out online and assessed craving for tobacco (primary outcome), smoking behaviour, well-being, and subjective appraisal. Individuals who applied the technique at least once during the previous year were categorized as the training group, whereas participants who never performed the training were categorized as the no-training group. Data were analysed using linear mixed models (LMMs). The study was preregistered as DRKS00021044. RESULTS: The completion rate was 45.5%. Less than 40% used the intervention at least once in the previous 12 months. LMM analyses showed a significant reduction in craving for tobacco for the training compared to the no-training group after 1 year. No significant group differences emerged in smoking behaviour, depressive symptoms, or quality of life. Subjective appraisal of the intervention was favorable, similar to the initial study. CONCLUSION: The present study provides preliminary support for the long-term efficacy of imaginal retraining on craving for tobacco but not on smoking behaviour, highlighting the importance of multimodal treatment concepts in smoking cessation that target a variety of maintaining factors. Future studies need to investigate the long-term efficacy of the intervention in prospective RCTs that test alternative ways of conveying the technique to improve adherence.",2022,2021/09/17,Eur Addict Res,28,1,68-79,34569480.0,10.1159/000518678,,#1139,Gehlenborg 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
[Applicability of Neonatal Pain Scores depending on Level of Education and Work Experience in Child Care],"Kaiser, J.; Laffolie, J.; Kappesser, J.; Ehrhardt, H.; Utsch, B.; Hermann, C.","INTRODUCTION: In management of pain the nursing staff plays a major role in measuring, preventing and treating pain. The influence of general work experience and experience with newborns was investigated by comparing PIPP and NRS measurements in groups with work experience and student nurses. METHODS: 44 students of the nursing school and 35 members of the staff of 2 university hospitals scored the Premature Infant Pain Profile PIPP - a 7 dimensional measurement tool - for 10 videos of painful procedures on preterm and newborn. The subjective impression of the patients' pain was obtained by a NRS. RESULTS: In contrast to the application of one dimensional measurement tools there were no differences between the groups with different experience levels. Also the work experience with newborn did not seem to influence the total PIPP score. Certainly both groups showed a moderate dispersion of the total values (e. g. Video 1: 10,5 [9-12] vs. 10 [3-11]). In NRS students rated the pain lower than experienced nurses. These results were not significant. CONCLUSION: The application of PIPP by students was equal to the application by experienced nurses. The work experience with newborn did not seem to influence the rating.

"Babies Smell Wonderful to Their Parents, Teenagers Do Not: an Exploratory Questionnaire Study on Children's Age and Personal Odor Ratings in a Polish Sample","Croy, I.; Frackowiak, T.; Hummel, T.; Sorokowska, A.","INTRODUCTION: Infant body odor is subjectively pleasant to parents and activates reward areas in the brain. Hence, body odor perception might contribute to parental bonding. However, it is unknown whether the perceived pleasantness of children's body odor varies over the course of a child's development. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-five parents (M = 36.9 years, SD = 7.3) were asked to assess the personal odor pleasantness of their children (N = 367; M = 9.3 years, SD = 6.4). RESULTS: Odor pleasantness was found to decrease as a function of children's age. Neither sex of the parent nor sex of the child contributed significantly to this effect. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the effect of age-related changes on personal odor pleasantness reflects olfactory modulation of parental-child relationships. IMPLICATIONS: Our study suggests that perception of young children's personal odor as pleasant may contribute to bonding and thereby caretaking, which is needed to a lesser degree after puberty than before.",2017,2017/06/27,Chemosens Percept,10,3,81-87,28932343.0,10.1007/s12078-017-9230-x,,#1141,Croy 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
IL-8 and CRP moderate the effects of preoperative psychological interventions on postoperative long-term outcomes 6 months after CABG surgery - The randomized controlled PSY-HEART trial,"Salzmann, S.; Euteneuer, F.; Laferton, J. A. C.; Shedden-Mora, M. C.; Schedlowski, M.; Moosdorf, R.; Rief, W.","INTRODUCTION: Inflammation has been related to several somatic and psychological disorders and may moderate effects of psychological interventions. In the PSY-HEART trial patients benefitted from preoperative psychological interventions before undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and, if necessary, concomitant valvular surgery, compared to standard medical care. In this study we examined whether patients' baseline inflammatory status moderated the intervention effects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective three-arm randomized clinical trial with 6-months follow-up, 124 patients scheduled for CABG surgery alone or concomitant with valvular surgery were randomized to (i) standard medical care only (SMC) or two preoperative psychological interventions: (ii) CBT-based optimizing expectations (EXPECT) and an (iii) an active control group focusing on emotional support (SUPPORT). Available baseline CRP- (n = 79), IL-6- (n = 78), IL-8- (n = 78) and TNF-alpha-(n = 80) parameters were considered as potential moderators (CRP as a categorical and continuous moderator). Linear mixed model analyses were calculated to test whether baseline inflammatory levels moderated intervention effects on disability, mental and physical quality of life at 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: IL-8 moderated intervention effects on patients' disability and categorical CRP moderated intervention effects on mental quality of life. Follow-up tests indicated that EXPECT (and in part SUPPORT) led to lower postoperative disability and higher mental quality of life compared to SMC in patients with low baseline inflammatory markers. EXPECT indicated higher mental quality of life compared to SUPPORT in the high CRP subgroup. Patients in the SMC group had higher mental quality of life in the high CRP subgroup compared to the low CRP subgroup. CONCLUSION: Especially for patients with a lower inflammatory baseline status preoperative psychological interventions might be helpful to optimize long-term CABG surgery outcomes.",2021,Jan,Brain Behav Immun,91,,202-211,33002633.0,10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.028,,#1142,Salzmann 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Increased impulsivity in pathological gambling: Considering nicotine dependence,"Kraplin, A.; Behrendt, S.; Scherbaum, S.; Dshemuchadse, M.; Buhringer, G.; Goschke, T.","INTRODUCTION: It has been highlighted that increased impulsivity is an important etiological factor in pathological gambling (PG). However, the role of the highly prevalent comorbid mental disorders in PG remains unclear. This is of special concern as the highest comorbidity was found between PG and nicotine dependence (ND), which, in turn, has also been associated with heightened impulsivity. This study aimed to find out whether increased impulsivity in PG is a specific characteristic related to comorbid mental disorders in general or especially to ND. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was designed that included a healthy control group and three disorder groups with comorbid PG excluding ND, comorbid PG including ND, and ND alone according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition. Impulsivity was assessed according to the dimensions response and choice impulsivity applying behavioral and self-report measures. RESULTS: We found (a) increased response impulsivity in the comorbid PG group when compared to the control group. Furthermore, increased choice impulsivity was found (b) in comorbid PG excluding ND and (c) in comorbid PG including ND when compared to ND alone. Other group differences did not reach significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that comorbid PG shares deficits in inhibitory control with ND. In contrast, maladaptive choices are a specific disorder characteristic of comorbid PG when compared to ND. If replicated in further studies, intervention strategies strengthening cognitive control skills might be effective for comorbid PG as well as ND whereas strategies enhancing maladaptive valuation of rewards might be specifically effective in comorbid PG.",2015,2015/03/30,J Clin Exp Neuropsychol,37,4,367-78,25819174.0,10.1080/13803395.2015.1018145,,#1146,Kraplin 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Long-term effects of telephone-based cognitive-behavioral intervention for family caregivers of people with dementia: Findings at 3-year follow-up,"Topfer, N. F.; Sittler, M. C.; Lechner-Meichsner, F.; Theurer, C.; Wilz, G.","INTRODUCTION: Long-term outcomes are of particular importance in evaluating interventions for family caregivers of people with dementia (PwD). So far, evidence for long-term effects (>6 months postintervention) is limited to four interventions. OBJECTIVE: We examined the long-term effects of Tele.TAnDem, a telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention, on a variety of outcomes at 3-year follow-up, the longest follow-up of any intervention study for caregivers of PwD (without continuous support). METHODS: Caregivers of PwD were randomly assigned to receive Tele.TAnDem consisting of 12 sessions over 6 months (intervention group [IG]) or usual care (control group [CG]). At 3-year follow-up (i.e., 2.5 years postintervention), 29 caregivers in the IG and 22 caregivers in the CG were still caring at home for a PwD. RESULTS: Caregivers in the IG reported significantly lower caregiver burden and higher quality of life regarding social relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Tele.TAnDem is successful in buffering detrimental effects of caregiving on caregiver burden and social relationships in the long term. The small- to medium-sized effects lie in the range of effect sizes reported in the few previous investigations. The findings add to the scant evidence that interventions yielding long-term outcomes have to date mostly been multicomponent interventions based on CBT principles with structured techniques and at least seven sessions over more than 2 months.

Screening accuracy of a 14-day smartphone ambulatory assessment of depression symptoms and mood dynamics in a general population sample: Comparison with the PHQ-9 depression screening,"Burchert, S.; Kerber, A.; Zimmermann, J.; Knaevelsrud, C.","INTRODUCTION: Major depression affects over 300 million people worldwide, but cases are often detected late or remain undetected. This increases the risk of symptom deterioration and chronification. Consequently, there is a high demand for low threshold but clinically sound approaches to depression detection. Recent studies show a great willingness among users of mobile health apps to assess daily depression symptoms. In this pilot study, we present a provisional validation of the depression screening app Moodpath. The app offers a 14-day ambulatory assessment (AA) of depression symptoms based on the ICD-10 criteria as well as ecologically momentary mood ratings that allow the study of short-term mood dynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: N = 113 Moodpath users were selected through consecutive sampling and filled out the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) after completing 14 days of AA with 3 question blocks (morning, midday, and evening) per day. The psychometric properties (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) of the ambulatory Moodpath screening were assessed based on the retrospective PHQ-9 screening result. In addition, several indicators of mood dynamics (e.g. average, inertia, instability), were calculated and investigated for their individual and incremental predictive value using regression models. RESULTS: We found a strong linear relationship between the PHQ-9 score and the AA Moodpath depression score (r = .76, p < .001). The app-based screening demonstrated a high sensitivity (.879) and acceptable specificity (.745). Different indicators of mood dynamics covered substantial amounts of PHQ-9 variance, depending on the number of days with mood data that were included in the analyses. DISCUSSION: AA and PHQ-9 shared a large proportion of variance but may not measure exactly the same construct. This may be due to the differences in the underlying diagnostic systems or due to differences in momentary and retrospective assessments. Further validation through structured clinical interviews is indicated. The results suggest that ambulatory assessed mood indicators are a promising addition to multimodal depression screening tools. Improving app-based AA screenings requires adapted screening algorithms and corresponding methods for the analysis of dynamic processes over time.",2021,2021/01/06,PLOS ONE,16,1,e0244955,33406120.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0244955,,#1149,Burchert 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

However, most research on this topic was based on self-report data. We aimed to investigate the latent structure of PTSD based on a clinical interview, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5). METHOD: A clinical sample of 345 participants took part in this multi-centre study. Participants were assessed with the CAPS-5 and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5). We evaluated eight competing models of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms and three competing models of ICD-11 PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the CAPS-5 was replicated. In CFAs, the Anhedonia model emerged as the best fitting model within all tested DSM-5 models. However, when compared with the Anhedonia model, the non-nested ICD-11 model as a less complex three-factor solution showed better model fit indices.

Gray matter alteration associated with pain catastrophizing in patients 6 months after lumbar disk surgery: a voxel-based morphometry study,"Chehadi, O.; Suchan, B.; Konietzny, K.; Koster, O.; Schmidt-Wilcke, T.; Hasenbring, M. I.","INTRODUCTION: Pain catastrophizing (PC), the increased attention to harmful aspects of pain (magnification), and the belief of low controllability (helplessness) has been shown to be important in the maintenance of pain. A growing research on structural alterations in chronic pain revealed an association between PC and brain areas that are involved in affective and cognitive pain processing. However, little is known about a differential effect of the components magnification and helplessness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify brain regions associated with overall PC and with the single components of magnification and helplessness. METHODS: We investigated 29 patients 6 months after lumbar disk surgery using voxel-based morphometry. Magnification and helplessness were assessed with subscales of the Avoidance-Endurance Questionnaire (AEQ); overall PC was computed using the sum score. The structural brain imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM8 and VBM8. Multiple regression analyses were performed with PC scales as predictors and depression as covariate. RESULTS: Pain catastrophizing was significantly associated with cortical gray matter in brain areas involved in processing attentional, sensory, and affective aspects of pain, including the left posterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, and medial frontal gyrus. In addition, we provide preliminary evidence for brain structure association related to magnification and helplessness. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for PC-related structural alterations in patients with low back pain, which are consistent with findings from previous research in different chronic pain disorders. This study is the first to evaluate brain changes related to differential domains of PC.",2017,Sep,Pain Rep,2,5,e617,29392232.0,10.1097/PR9.0000000000000617,,#1154,Chehadi 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Self-Stigma Among People With Mental Health Problems in Terms of Warmth and Competence,"Gartner, L.; Asbrock, F.; Euteneuer, F.; Rief, W.; Salzmann, S.","INTRODUCTION: Self-stigma arising from public stigma is a heavy burden for people suffering from mental health problems. Both public stigma and self-stigma encompass the same three elements: stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. Public stigma has already been successfully explored by the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) and the Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes (BIAS) map. However, this is not the case for self-stigma. Therefore, this is the first study that applies SCM and the BIAS map to self-stigma by examining whether the effects of self-stereotypes on self-directed discrimination would be mediated by self-directed prejudices in people with mental health problems. METHOD: Within a total sample of N = 823 participants, who took part in an online survey, n = 336 people reported mental health problems. Mental health and self-stereotypes (warmth, competence), self-directed prejudice (negative emotions), and self-directed discrimination (active/passive self-harm) were assessed. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling supported the hypothesis that the stereotype dimensions warmth and competence negatively related to prejudice, while stronger prejudice was associated with more discrimination (active/passive self-harm). Prejudice fully mediated the relationship between stereotypes and discrimination. The indirect effects of warmth and competence on active and passive self-harm were moderated by competence and warmth. DISCUSSION: Implications for further research on self-stigma and the usage of SCM and BIAS map are discussed.",2022,2022/06/14,Front Psychol,13,,877491,35774956.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.877491,,#1157,Gartner 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Evidence of an IFN-gamma by early life stress interaction in the regulation of amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli,"Redlich, R.; Stacey, D.; Opel, N.; Grotegerd, D.; Dohm, K.; Kugel, H.; Heindel, W.; Arolt, V.; Baune, B. T.; Dannlowski, U.","INTRODUCTION: Since numerous studies have found that exposure to early life stress leads to increased peripheral inflammation and psychiatric disease, it is thought that peripheral immune activation precedes and possibly mediates the onset of stress-associated psychiatric disease. Despite early studies, IFNgamma has received little attention relative to other inflammatory cytokines in the context of the pathophysiology of affective disorders. Neuroimaging endophenotypes have emerged recently as a promising means of elucidating these types of complex relationships including the modeling of the interaction between environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Here we investigate the GxE relationship between early-life stress and genetic variants of IFNgamma on emotion processing. METHODS: To investigate the impact of the relationship between genetic variants of IFNgamma (rs1861494, rs2069718, rs2430561) and early life stress on emotion processing, a sample of healthy adults (n=409) undergoing an emotional faces paradigm in an fMRI study were genotyped and analysed. Information on early life stress was obtained via Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). RESULTS: A positive association between early life stress and amygdala reactivity was found. Specifically, the main effect of genotype of rs1861494 on amygdala reactivity indicates a higher neural response in C allele carriers compared to T homozygotes, while we did not find main effects of rs2069718 and rs2430561. Importantly, interaction analyses revealed a specific interaction between IFNgamma genotype (rs1861494) and early life stress affecting amygdala reactivity to emotional faces, resulting from a positive association between CTQ scores and amygdala reactivity in C allele carriers while this association was absent in T homozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that firstly the genetic variant of IFNgamma (rs1861494) is involved with the regulation of amygdala reactivity to emotional stimuli and secondly, that this genetic variant moderates effects of early life stress on emotion processing. These findings reiterate the importance that inflammatory genes play in the interaction with early life stress and the regulation of emotion processing.",2015,Dec,Psychoneuroendocrinology,62,,166-73,26313134.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.08.008,,#1159,Redlich 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Matters of Life and Death: An Experimental Study Investigating Psychological Interventions to Encourage the Readiness for End-of-Life Conversations,"von Blanckenburg, P.; Leppin, N.; Nagelschmidt, K.; Seifart, C.; Rief, W.","INTRODUCTION: Talking about death and dying is evoking discomfort in many persons, resulting in avoidance of this topic. However, end-of-life discussions can alleviate distress and uncertainties in both old and young adults, but only a minority uses this option in palliative care. Even in healthy populations, talking about death is often seen as alleviative and worthwhile, but rarely initiated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate different psychological interventions (a) encouraging the readiness for end-of-life discussions and (b) changing death attitudes in healthy adults of different ages. METHODS: 168 participants were randomized to four different interventions (IG1: value-based intervention with end-of-life perspective, IG2: motivation-based intervention with end-of-life perspective, IG3: combination of IG1 and IG2, CG: control group). Primary outcome was the readiness to engage in end-of-life topics. Secondary outcomes were fear of death, fear of dying and death acceptance. Assessments took place before, directly after the intervention and at 2 weeks of follow up. RESULTS: IG2 and IG3 reported significantly more changes in the readiness to engage in end-of-life discussions than the CG (F[5.61, 307] = 4.83, p < 0.001, etap2 = 0.081) directly after the intervention. The effect of IG3 remained stable at the follow-up. There were no significant effects of the interventions on end-of-life fears or death acceptance. Acceptability of the interventions was very high. CONCLUSIONS: Short interventions can be useful to encourage end-of-life discussions and could be integrated in health care programs. The efficacy and effectiveness of these short interventions in palliative patients are currently examined.",2021,2020/11/19,Psychother Psychosom,90,4,243-254,33212438.0,10.1159/000511199,,#1160,vonBlanckenburg 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy on self-reported suicidal ideation: results from a randomised controlled trial in patients with residual depressive symptoms,"Forkmann, T.; Wichers, M.; Geschwind, N.; Peeters, F.; van Os, J.; Mainz, V.; Collip, D.","INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on suicidal ideation in an open-label randomised controlled trial of patients with residual depressive symptoms. Furthermore, this study aimed at examining whether an effect of MBCT on suicidal ideation was dependent on a reduction in depression severity, worry and rumination, or an increase in mindfulness. METHODS: One hundred and thirty participants were randomised to a treatment arm (treatment as usual plus MBCT) or a wait list arm. Change in depression, change in worry, change in rumination and change in mindfulness were entered as covariates in a repeated measures ANOVA in order to assess to what degree MBCT-induced changes in suicidal ideation were independent from changes in these parameters. RESULTS: There was a significant groupxtime (pre vs. post) interaction on suicidal ideation indicating a significant reduction of suicidal ideation in the MBCT group, but not in the control group. The interaction remained significant after addition of the above covariates. Change in worry was the only covariate associated with change in suicidal ideation, causing a moderate reduction in the interaction effect size. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MBCT may affect suicidal ideation in patients with residual depressive symptoms and that this effect may be mediated, in part, by participants' enhanced capacity to distance themselves from worrying thoughts.",2014,Nov,Compr Psychiatry,55,8,1883-90,25218397.0,10.1016/j.comppsych.2014.08.043,,#1161,Forkmann 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Frequency and correlates of maladaptive responses to paranoid thoughts in patients with psychosis compared to a population sample,"Lincoln, T. M.; Mobius, C.; Huber, M. T.; Nagel, M.; Moritz, S.","INTRODUCTION: The aims of this study were to identify whether responses to paranoid thoughts distinguish patients with psychotic disorders from people in the population who have paranoid thoughts occasionally and to identify factors that are associated with and might explain the different ways of responding. METHODS: Paranoid thoughts were assessed in patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (n = 32) and a population control sample (n = 34) with the Paranoia Checklist. Responses to paranoid thoughts were assessed with the Reactions to Paranoid Thoughts Scale (RePT) and social support, self-efficacy and cognitive insight were assessed as potential correlates of the responses to paranoid thoughts. RESULTS: The patients showed significantly more depressed, physical and devaluating responses to paranoid thoughts and employed less normalising responses than the controls. The differences in normalising responses were explained by perceived social integration, whereas the differences in depressive responses were explained by the overall levels of depression and partly explained by externality and social integration. CONCLUSIONS: Maladaptive responses to paranoid thoughts could be relevant to the pathogenesis and maintenance of persecutory delusions. Interventions aimed at reducing paranoia could benefit from targeting dysfunctional responses to paranoid thoughts and by placing a stronger emphasis on treating depression and improving social integration.",2014,2014/07/25,Cogn Neuropsychiatry,19,6,509-26,25062067.0,10.1080/13546805.2014.931220,,#1163,Lincoln 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Psychedelic Experiences During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From an International Online Survey,"Evens, R.; Reiche, S.; Marek, R. M.; Moon, D. U.; Gross, R. E.; Romanello, A.; Jalilzadeh Masah, D.; Scicchitano Bockheler, M.; Gutwinski, S.; Montag, C.; Mick, I.; Majic, T.","Introduction: The current corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a serious global health crisis that has affected large parts of the public and private life worldwide, including the use of psychoactive substances. In this study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of serotonergic psychedelics, i.e., the settings in which people use psychedelics, the motives of usage, and the subjective quality of psychedelic experiences. Methods: The study was part of an international, cross-sectional, internet-based survey (N = 5,049) available in five languages (English, German, Spanish, Italian, and Korean) carried out during the early phase of the pandemic from April to August 2020. Participants were asked to retrospectively rate settings and motives of psychedelic substance use before the pandemic and in the last 4 weeks during the pandemic, as well as changes in psychedelic experiences. Results: Of n = 1,375 participants that reported the use psychedelics in 2019 or 2020, n = 642 (46.6%) also took psychedelics during the pandemic. During the pandemic, participants used psychedelics significantly less often in settings that were outside their home. Top motives to use psychedelics were comparable before and during the pandemic, but participants consumed less out of curiosity, to celebrate, or because friends took it, and more out of boredom. An increase in positively connoted, often pro-social experiences was observed. Two thirds of participants who used psychedelics during the pandemic claimed that psychedelics had helped them to deal better with the corona pandemic at least slightly. Discussion: Changes in setting and motives were mostly in line with restrictions caused by control measures to contain the spread of the virus. The unexpected increase in positively connoted experiences possibly reflects a favorable interaction of environmental macro- and individual micro-contexts during the pandemic (e.g., by reducing the use in more uncontrolled recreational settings or by encouraging a strong self-selection of substance users due to the expectation of ""bad trips""). Increased pro-social feelings under psychedelics might reflect a desire for social interactions in times of social distancing and pandemic-related stress and anxiety.",2021,2021/11/04,Front Psychiatry,12,,732028,34803757.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2021.732028,,#1164,Evens 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Weight/shape and muscularity concerns and emotional problems in adolescent boys and girls: A cross-lagged panel analysis,"Hoffmann, S.; Cortes-Garcia, L.; Warschburger, P.","INTRODUCTION: The goal of the present study was to identify the prospective relations between weight/shape and muscularity concerns and emotional problems in adolescents. METHODS: Self-report data of 966 German male and female adolescents were analyzed in a cross-lagged panel design. RESULTS: Analyses of latent means revealed significant correlations between weight/shape concern and emotional problems as well as between muscularity concern and emotional problems in both genders. Moreover, weight/shape concern predicted emotional problems prospectively, but only in girls. Regarding muscularity concern, we could not find any prospective relation with emotional problems in boys or girls from the general population. CONCLUSIONS: It is assumed that as appearance is highly relevant for the self-concept in girls, concerns about the look might promote emotional problems. Thus, weight/shape concern should be addressed in the prevention of emotional problems in adolescent girls, whereas further research is necessary investigating the contribution of muscularity concern in this context.",2018,Oct,J Adolesc,68,1,70-77,30041056.0,10.1016/j.adolescence.2018.07.005,,#1165,Hoffmann 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Patients Characteristics and Psychosocial Treatment in Psychodynamic and Cognitive Behavior Therapy,"Muschalla, B.; Linden, M.; Rose, M.","Introduction: The most prevalent psychotherapy schools are psychodynamic (PDT) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). There are no scientific guidelines on which type of patient should be treated by which therapist, and how they can find the best one. Part of the answer can be derived from data on who is treated in which way. Objective: Objective of this study was to compare patients in routine PDT and CBT to describe similarities and differences in regard to patient status and treatment. Materials and Methods: A research psychotherapist visited 73 cognitive behavior therapists and 58 psychodynamic psychotherapists in their office and asked them to report about the last cases they had seen. There were 188 CBT and 134 PD case reports. Results: There were no significant differences in socio-demographics between PDT and CBT patients. The average number of treatment session so far was significantly higher in PDT than CBT. There were longer duration of illness, more parallel medical treatments and higher rates of sick leave in CBT patients. While assessment of capacities with the Mini-ICF-APP showed no differences, more participation restrictions were found in CBT patients. Correspondingly there were more sociomedical interventions, especially in regard to work. Conclusions: The differences between PDT and CBT may be explained by the fact that PDT requires analytical capabilities on the side of the patient, which may exclude patients with social problems, while CBT is coping oriented which allows the inclusion of all kinds of patients. Still, in both treatment modes, complex patients are treated with multidimensional interventions.",2021,2021/05/14,Front Psychiatry,12,,664975,34054618.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2021.664975,,#1167,Muschalla 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"The relationship between social media use, stress symptoms and burden caused by coronavirus (Covid-19) in Germany and Italy: A cross-sectional and longitudinal investigation","Brailovskaia, J.; Cosci, F.; Mansueto, G.; Margraf, J.","INTRODUCTION: The need for ""social distancing"" to reduce the spread of Covid-19 is accompanied by an increase of social media use (SMU). Many people engage in intensive online activity to find information about the current Covid-19 situation and to interact about it with other users. The present study investigated the extent of SMU as Covid-19 information source and its relationship with stress symptoms and burden caused by the pandemic in Germany and Italy. METHODS: Cross-national longitudinal (Germany, N = 501; 3-months period) and cross-sectional (Italy, N = 951) data on Covid-19 information sources, stress symptoms and burden caused by Covid-19 were collected via online surveys. RESULTS: About 50% of the German sample and about 60% of the Italian sample frequently used SM as Covid-19 information source. Cross-sectional analyses in both countries revealed that SMU is positively associated with stress symptoms and experienced burden. Moreover, stress symptoms mediated the link between SMU and burden. This was also confirmed by longitudinal analyses in Germany (burden assessed three months after SMU and stress symptoms). LIMITATIONS: The mostly female and relatively young sample composition limits the generalizability of present findings. Only two European countries were investigated. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings reveal a potential negative impact of enhanced SMU on individual mental health state and behavior. Additionally, they emphasize the significance of a conscious and cautious use of SM as information source specifically during the pandemic.",2021,Jan,J Affect Disord Rep,3,,100067,35434690.0,10.1016/j.jadr.2020.100067,,#1168,Brailovskaia 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Association of NPSR1 gene variation and neural activity in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia and healthy controls,"Gechter, J.; Liebscher, C.; Geiger, M.

The functional A/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs324981 in the neuropeptide S receptor gene (NPSR1) has repeatedly been associated with panic disorder and might partly drive function respectively dysfunction of the neural ""fear network"". We aimed to investigate whether the NPSR1 T risk allele was associated with malfunctioning in a fronto-limbic network during the anticipation and perception of agoraphobia-specific stimuli. METHOD: 121 patients with PD/AG and 77 healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the disorder specific ""Westphal-Paradigm"". It consists of neutral and agoraphobia-specific pictures, half of the pictures were cued to induce anticipatory anxiety. RESULTS: Risk allele carriers showed significantly higher amygdala activation during the perception of agoraphobia-specific stimuli than A/A homozygotes. A linear group x genotype interaction during the perception of agoraphobia-specific stimuli showed a strong trend towards significance. Patients with the one or two T alleles displayed the highest and HC with the A/A genotype the lowest activation in the inferior orbitofrontal cortex (iOFC).

METHODS: In a sample of 449 Facebook users (age: M(SD) = 31.07(9.52), range: 18-65) the personality trait narcissism, Facebook flow, intensity of Facebook use, and Facebook addiction were assessed by an online survey. RESULTS: In a moderated mediation analysis, the positive relationship between narcissism and Facebook addiction was positively mediated by the level of flow experienced on Facebook. Intensity of Facebook use moderated the positive association between Facebook flow and Facebook addiction. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive Facebook use may cause psychological dependence.

Altered Appetitive Conditioning and Neural Connectivity in Subjects With Compulsive Sexual Behavior,"Klucken, T.; Wehrum-Osinsky, S.; Schweckendiek, J.; Kruse, O.; Stark, R.","INTRODUCTION: There has been growing interest in a better understanding of the etiology of compulsive sexual behavior (CSB). It is assumed that facilitated appetitive conditioning might be an important mechanism for the development and maintenance of CSB, but no study thus far has investigated these processes. AIM: To explore group differences in neural activity associated with appetitive conditioning and connectivity in subjects with CSB and a healthy control group. METHODS: Two groups (20 subjects with CSB and 20 controls) were exposed to an appetitive conditioning paradigm during a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, in which a neutral stimulus (CS+) predicted visual sexual stimuli and a second stimulus (CS-) did not. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood oxygen level-dependent responses and psychophysiologic interaction. RESULTS: As a main result, we found increased amygdala activity during appetitive conditioning for the CS+ vs the CS- and decreased coupling between the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex in the CSB vs control group. CONCLUSION: The findings show that neural correlates of appetitive conditioning and neural connectivity are altered in patients with CSB. The increased amygdala activation might reflect facilitated conditioning processes in patients with CSB. In addition, the observed decreased coupling could be interpreted as a marker for impaired emotion regulation success in this group.",2016,Apr,J Sex Med,13,4,627-36,26936075.0,10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.01.013,,#1172,Klucken 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Effectiveness of a Guided Internet- and Mobile-Based Intervention for Patients with Chronic Back Pain and Depression (WARD-BP): A Multicenter, Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial","Baumeister, H.; Paganini, S.; Sander, L. B.; Lin, J.; Schlicker, S.; Terhorst, Y.; Moshagen, M.; Bengel, J.; Lehr, D.; Ebert, D. D.","INTRODUCTION: There is neither strong evidence on effective treatments for patients with chronic back pain (CBP) and depressive disorder nor sufficiently available mental health care offers. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to assess the effectiveness of internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI) as a scalable approach for treating depression in a routine care setting. METHODS: This is an observer-masked, multicenter, pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a randomization ratio of 1:1.Patients with CBP and diagnosed depressive disorder (mild to moderate severity) were recruited from 82 orthopedic rehabilitation clinics across Germany. The intervention group (IG) received a guided depression IMI tailored to CBP next to treatment-as-usual (TAU; including medication), while the control group (CG) received TAU. The primary outcome was observer-masked clinician-rated Hamilton depression severity (9-week follow-up). The secondary outcomes were: further depression outcomes, pain-related outcomes, health-related quality of life, and work capacity. Biostatistician blinded analyses using regression models were conducted by intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis. RESULTS: Between October 2015 and July 2017, we randomly assigned 210 participants (IG, n = 105; CG, n = 105), mostly with only a mild pain intensity but substantial pain disability. No statistically significant difference in depression severity between IG and CG was observed at the 9-week follow-up (beta = -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.05). Explorative secondary depression (4/9) and pain-related (4/6) outcomes were in part significant (p < 0.05). Health-related quality of life was significantly higher in the IG. No differences were found in work capacity. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that an IMI for patients with CBP and depression in a routine care setting has limited impact on depression.

Trait sexual motivation questionnaire: concept and validation,"Stark, R.; Kagerer, S.; Walter, B.; Vaitl, D.; Klucken, T.; Wehrum-Osinsky, S.","INTRODUCTION: Trait sexual motivation defines a psychological construct that reflects the long-lasting degree of motivation for sexual activities, which is assumed to be the result of biological and sociocultural influences. With this definition, it shares commonalities with other sexuality-related constructs like sexual desire, sexual drive, sexual needs, and sexual compulsivity. AIM: The Trait Sexual Motivation Questionnaire (TSMQ) was developed in order to measure trait sexual motivation with its different facets. METHODS: Several steps were conducted: First, items were composed assessing sexual desire, the effort made to gain sex, as well as specific sexual behaviors. Factor analysis of the data of a first sample (n = 256) was conducted. Second, the factor solution was verified by a confirmatory factor analysis in a second sample (n = 498) and construct validity was demonstrated. Third, the temporal stability of the TSMQ was tested in a third study (n = 59). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Questionnaire data. RESULTS: The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that trait sexual motivation is best characterized by four subscales: Solitary Sexuality, Importance of Sex, Seeking Sexual Encounters, and Comparison with Others. It could be shown that the test quality of the questionnaire is high. Most importantly for the trait concept, the retest reliability after 1 year was r = 0.87. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the TSMQ is indeed a suitable tool for measuring long-lasting sexual motivation with high test quality and high construct validity.

A.; Friedrich, A.; Classen, M.","INTRODUCTION: Up to 60% of all college students suffer from a poor sleep quality, and 7.7% meet all criteria of an insomnia disorder. Sleep problems have a great impact on the students' daily life, for example, the grade point average. Due to irregular daytime routines, chronotype changes, side jobs and exam periods, they need specialized treatments for improving sleep. ""Studieren wie im Schlaf"" (SWIS; (studying in your sleep)) is a multicomponent sleep training that combines Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia and Hypnotherapy for Insomnia to improve students' sleep, insomnia symptoms and nightmares. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the acceptance, feasibility and the first effects of SWIS. METHODS: Twenty-seven students (mean =24.24, standard deviation =3.57) participated in a study of pre-post design. The acceptance and feasibility were measured with questionnaires. In addition, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), sleep logs and actigraphy were implemented. Further variables encompassed daytime sleepiness, sleep-related personality traits and cognitions about sleep. RESULTS: Seventy-four percent of the participants reported symptoms of an insomnia disorder, and 51.9% fulfilled all criteria of an insomnia disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition). Correspondingly, the students suffered from clinically relevant sleep problems according to the PSQI. The SWIS sleep training is a well-accepted and feasible program. Significant improvements were observed in the subjective sleep quality and sleep-related personality traits, as well as clinical improvements in objective sleep measures. DISCUSSION: Findings showed that SWIS is a feasible program for the treatment of sleep problems in college and university students due to its various effects on sleep and cognitive outcomes. Further evaluation of follow-up measurements and additional variables, that is, cognitive performance and mental health, is needed.",2017,2017/07,Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,13,,1989-2001,28794633.0,10.2147/NDT.S142067,,#1176,Schlarb 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"Associations of Buying-Shopping Disorder Symptoms with Identity Confusion, Materialism, and Socially Undesirable Personality Features in a Community Sample","Muller, A.; Claes, L.; Birlin, A.; Georgiadou, E.; Laskowski, N. M.; Steins-Loeber, S.; Brand, M.; de Zwaan, M.","INTRODUCTION: While identity problems and materialistic value endorsement have been described as predisposing factors for buying-shopping disorder (BSD) in the literature, little empirical data are available on the role of socially undesirable personality features that may contribute to financial misconduct and manipulative interpersonal behaviors in BSD. The dark triad of personality refers to such offensive yet non-pathological personality traits and has been applied to addictive behaviors in the past. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the ""dark triad"" dimensions Machiavellianism, subclinical narcissism, and subclinical psychopathy predict symptoms of BSD above and beyond identity confusion and materialism, or moderate the relationship between materialism and symptoms of BSD. METHOD: The participants comprised a convenience sample (N = 272, 72.4% women) aged between 18 and 67 years. Assessment included standard questionnaires for BSD, identity problems, materialism, and the dark triad of personality. RESULTS: Zero-order correlations indicate a weak association between BSD and the dark triad dimensions Machiavellianism and narcissism, but not psychopathy. Results of a moderated regression analysis with BSD symptoms as a dependent variable revealed significant main effects for materialism, female gender, and a significant ""narcissism by materialism"" effect, after accounting for identity confusion/synthesis and the single dark triad traits. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that individuals with BSD attempt to address their narcissistic deficits via materialistic possessions. This assumption warrants further investigation in a clinical sample.",2021,2020/10/29,Eur Addict Res,27,2,142-150,33120395.0,10.1159/000511078,,#1178,Muller 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Investigating the effect of proactive interference control training on intrusive memories,"Woud, M. L.; Heeren, A.; Shkreli, L.; Meyer, T.; Egeri, L.; Cwik, J. C.; Zlomuzica, A.; Kessler, H.; Margraf, J.","Intrusive re-experiencing is a hallmark symptom of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). According to prominent models of intrusive phenomena, intrusive memories may result from impairments in the efficiency of working memory capacity (WMC), more specifically proactive interference control. Yet, experimental research is scarce. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate experimentally the role of proactive interference control in intrusive memories. We randomly assigned 57 healthy participants to either receive a high interference control training or a low interference control training. Participants were then exposed to highly distressing film clips. WMC was assessed before and after the training. Intrusion symptoms were assessed directly post-training and after one week using an Intrusion Provocation Task (IPT), a one-week intrusions diary, and the retrospective intrusion subscale of the Impact of Event Sale - Revised (IES-R). Results indicated that both groups reported improvements in WMC and fewer intrusions on the second IPT post-training, with no differences between groups. Similarly, no group differences on intrusions were found at one-week follow-up (i.e., intrusion diary and IES-R). To conclude, these data are not consistent with the hypothesis that WMC plays a role in intrusive re-experiencing.

The impact of affective information on working memory: A psychometric approach,"Brose, A.; Rueschkamp, J. M. G.; Kuppens, P.; Gerstorf, D.; Schmiedek, F.","It has been debated whether working memory (WM) performance is modulated by the valence of the stimuli that are being processed. A recent meta-analysis revealed that at the behavioral level and in individuals without mental health problems, mean-level performance differences in WM tasks with neutral versus affective conditions are small to negligible. We took this finding an important step further by employing a psychometric approach. This is an important refinement of previous work because even in the absence of mean-level differences, differential processing of affective versus nonaffective information may still be occurring. We examined whether at the construct level, 2 latent WM factors could be distinguished in capturing the processing of neutral and affective stimuli, respectively. Applying confirmatory factor analyses (N = 183 university students) to a battery of 18 tasks (3 n-back paradigms crossed with 3 stimulus types and neutral vs. affective valence), the 2 factors correlated perfectly. This result was replicated when neutral stimuli were analyzed together with either positive or negative stimuli. Based on individual differences, the processing of affective versus nonaffective stimuli in WM therefore cannot be distinguished, at least not in a student sample of younger adults.

Automatic and Controlled Processing: Implications for Eating Behavior,"Furtjes, S.; King, J. A.; Goeke, C.; Seidel, M.; Goschke, T.; Horstmann, A.; Ehrlich, S.","It is a widely held view that humans have control over their food choices and consumption. However, research also suggests that eating behavior is often triggered by contextual cues and guided by automaticities and habits. Interestingly, the dichotomy between automatic and controlled processing has recently been challenged, suggesting that they may be intertwined. In a large female sample (n = 567), we investigated the hypothesis that task-based and self-reported measures of automatic and controlled processing would interact and impact self-reported eating behavior. Results analyzed via structural equation modeling suggest that automatic, but not controlled processing, during a modified flanker task, including a context-specific proportion congruent (CSPC) manipulation, was inversely associated with self-reported self-control. The influence of self-control on unhealthy eating behavior (i.e., uncontrolled and emotional eating, heightened consumption of fat and sugar) was only indirect via habitual behavior, which itself had a strong direct impact. Unhealthy eating was further associated with real-life outcomes (e.g., body mass index (BMI)). Our findings suggest that eating behavior may indeed be guided primarily by automaticities and habits, whereas self-control might facilitate this association. Having self-control over eating might therefore be most effective by avoiding contextual cues eliciting undesired automatic behavior and establishing habits that serve long-term goals.",2020,Apr 15,Nutrients,12,4,1097,32326623.0,10.3390/nu12041097,,#1182,Furtjes 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The extent and origin of discordance between self- and observer-rated depression in patients with psychosis,"Hartmann, M. M.; Fritzsche, A.; Lincoln, T. M.","It is assumed that patients with psychosis have difficulties indicating clinical symptoms accurately in self-reported measures. The present study investigated the ability of self-rating scales to detect symptoms of depression in patients with psychosis and aimed at identifying demographic, clinical and neurocognitive factors that predict the discordance between self-ratings and observer ratings. Inpatients and outpatients with psychosis (n=118) were assessed for depression by applying two observer rating and two self-rating scales. We found reasonable correlation scores between the ratings by patients and observers (range: r=0.50-0.57). In half of the patients (49.2%) the self-ratings corresponded well with the ratings of clinicians. Patients who rated their depressive symptoms as less severe than the clinicians demonstrated more negative symptoms such as blunted affect and poor affective rapport. Patients who rated their depression symptoms as being more severe were characterized by more self-reported general psychopathology. The concordance rates indicate that self-ratings of depression can be a valid additional tool in clinical assessment of patients with psychosis. However, clinicians should be attentive to the fact that some patients might have a general tendency to over-report symptoms and that patients with negative symptoms tend to be rated as more depressed in observer ratings compared with self-assessments.",2013,Feb 28,Psychiatry Res,205,3,247-52,23063295.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2012.08.024,,#1183,Hartmann 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

All disorders evidenced diminished baseline HF-HRV relative to controls. Baseline HRV differences were maintained throughout relaxation. For hyperventilation, PD and GAD demonstrated greater HR than controls. Psychotropic medication did not account for HF-HRV differences except in OCD. Age and sex evidenced multiple main effects.

Orthorexia nervosa and healthy orthorexia as new eating styles,"Barthels, F.; Barrada, J. R.; Roncero, M.","It was recently proposed that healthy orthorexia (HeOr) and orthorexia nervosa (OrNe) should be differentiated. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether the two dimensions of orthorexia can be considered new eating styles or basically equivalent to restrained eating behavior. Two samples of university students (sample 1, n = 460; sample 2, n = 509) completed the Teruel Orthorexia Scale (TOS), the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Factor analysis with the TOS and DEBQ items together revealed an adequate fit for the preexisting five-factor solution (TOS: OrNe and HeOr; DEBQ: Restrained Eating, Emotional Eating, and External Eating). This result points out that these factors are conceptually distinguishable. Moreover, we tested whether the different eating styles presented different patterns of correlations with gender, body mass index (BMI), and age, and whether OrNe and HeOr predicted Positive and Negative Affect after controlling for Restrained, Emotional, and External Eating. Whereas Restrained and Emotional Eating were higher for women and increased with BMI in both samples, HeOr and OrNe presented much lower associations with these variables. OrNe was positively related to Negative Affect and negatively to Positive Affect, whereas HeOr was positively related to Positive Affect. Again, this result supports the assumption that OrNe is a new variant of disordered eating, whereas HeOr could possibly be seen as a protective behavior.",2019,2019/07/10,PLOS ONE,14,7,e0219609,31291364.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0219609,,#1186,Barthels 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Both groups reported highest well-being ratings relative to social and past temporal comparisons and lowest relative to prospective temporal comparison. Furthermore, clinical participants engaged in more upward than downward comparisons, whereas this was not the case for healthy control participants.

When the killing has been done: Exploring associations of personality with third-party judgment and punishment of homicides in moral dilemma scenarios,"Behnke, A.; Strobel, A.; Armbruster, D.","Killing people is universally considered reprehensible and evokes in observers a need to punish perpetrators. Here, we explored how observers' personality is associated with their cognitive, emotional, and punishing reactions towards perpetrators using data from 1,004 participants who responded to a set of fifteen third-party perspective moral dilemmas. Among those, four scenarios (architect, life boat, footbridge, smother for dollars) describing deliberate killings were compared to investigate the role of the content features ""motive for killing"" (selfish vs. utilitarian) and ""evitability of victims' death"". Participants' moral appropriateness ratings, emotions towards perpetrators, and assigned punishments revealed complex scenario-personality interactions. Trait psychopathy was associated with harsher punishments in all scenarios but also with less concern about killing in general, an increased moral appreciation of utilitarian motives for killing, and a reduced concern about the killing of avoidable victims. Need for cognition was associated with considering a utilitarian motive for killing as a mitigating factor, while intuitive/authority-obedient thinking was linked to a strong focus on avoidability of harm as an aggravating factor when assigning punishments. Other-oriented empathy, trait anxiety, and justice sensitivity did not account for differences in third-party punishments.

Patterns of change in different phases of outpatient psychotherapy: a stage-sequential pattern analysis of change in session reports,"Rubel, J.; Lutz, W.; Schulte, D.","Knowledge about typical change patterns of psychotherapy patients can help to improve treatment guidelines for psychological disorders. Recent studies showed that it is possible to identify several patient subgroups with regard to their early change pattern. However, although focusing on the early phase of treatment, change patterns in later stages have hardly been investigated yet. In this study, Growth Mixture Modelling was used to identify latent change classes in different phases of therapy in a naturalistic sample of 1229 psychotherapy outpatients. Furthermore, this paper inquired into the relation between the change patterns in different phases as well as their predictive power for therapy length and outcome. Results revealed different change patterns for the three investigated phases. While in an early treatment phase, (sessions one-six) five different change patterns could be identified: the number of change classes decreased considerably over time, resulting in three patterns in the second (sessions 7-12) and two in the third phase (sessions 13-18). In each phase, by far, the biggest class showed a pattern of good progress with small/no further improvements. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGES: Most change in patients' progress estimates took place in an early phase of the treatment and levelled out on a relatively high level in later phases of the treatment. Substantial improvements were still present in later phases of the treatment but occurred less frequent than in early stages.

Opposing roles for amygdala and vmPFC in the return of appetitive conditioned responses in humans,"Ebrahimi, C.; Koch, S. P.; Pietrock, C.; Fydrich, T.; Heinz, A.; Schlagenhauf, F.","Learning accounts of addiction and obesity emphasize the persistent power of Pavlovian reward cues to trigger craving and increase relapse risk. While extinction can reduce conditioned responding, Pavlovian relapse phenomena-the return of conditioned responding following successful extinction-challenge the long-term success of extinction-based treatments. Translational laboratory models of Pavlovian relapse could therefore represent a valuable tool to investigate the mechanisms mediating relapse, although so far human research has mostly focused on return of fear phenomena. To this end we developed an appetitive conditioning paradigm with liquid food rewards in combination with a 3-day design to investigate the return of appetitive Pavlovian responses and the involved neural structures in healthy subjects. Pavlovian conditioning (day 1) was assessed in 62 participants, and a subsample (n = 33) further completed extinction (day 2) and a reinstatement test (day 3). Conditioned responding was assessed on explicit (pleasantness ratings) and implicit measures (reaction time, skin conductance, heart rate, startle response) and reinstatement effects were further evaluated using fMRI. We observed a return of conditioned responding during the reinstatement test, evident by enhanced skin conductance responses, accompanied by enhanced BOLD responses in the amygdala. On an individual level, psychophysiological reinstatement intensity was significantly anticorrelated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation, and marginally anticorrelated with enhanced amygdala-vmPFC connectivity during late reinstatement. Our results extend evidence from return of fear phenomena to the appetitive domain, and highlight the role of the vmPFC and its functional connection with the amygdala in regulating appetitive Pavlovian relapse.",2019,May 21,Transl Psychiatry,9,1,148,31113931.0,10.1038/s41398-019-0482-x,,#1195,Ebrahimi 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Blocking under stress: Sustained attention to stimuli without predictive value?,"Kausche, F. M.; Schwabe, L.","Learning is blocked when a stimulus is followed by an outcome that is identical to what was expected and thus contains no new information. This classic 'blocking' effect exemplifies that learning is driven by the predictive value of stimuli, which in turn should guide the allocation of attentional resources. Stress is known to be a powerful modulator of learning and memory. However, whether stress may affect attentional processing during predictive learning is largely unknown. Here, we combined electroencephalography and eye-tracking with an experimental stress manipulation and a fear conditioning paradigm designed to probe the blocking effect, to determine if and how stress impacts efficient attentional processing during predictive learning. Participants' explicit ratings indicated, irrespective of stress, a blocking effect. The control group further showed preferential attentional processing of predictive vs. unpredictive stimuli, reflected in differential fixation durations and a differential N2pc. Stress abolished this differentiation and led even to sustained attention, indicated by higher late positive potentials, to stimuli with low predictive value. Moreover, stress resulted in an overall increase in the P3b during the blocking phase, suggesting increased attentional processing, presumably due to impaired access to previously learned associations. Together, our results suggest that while control participants paid particular attention to predictive stimuli and reduced attention to unpredictive stimuli, in line with the classic blocking effect, stress before learning reduced this preferential processing. Thus, the present findings highlight the role of attention allocation for predictive fear learning and suggest that stress may impair efficient information processing against the background of prior experiences.",2020,Feb,Neurobiol Learn Mem,168,,107158,31911197.0,10.1016/j.nlm.2020.107158,,#1197,Kausche 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The time course of speaker-specific language processing,"Kroczek, L. O. H.; Gunter, T.

In the present EEG study, we presented thirty-two participants with auditory sentence stimuli of two speakers. Speakers differed in their use of two particular syntactic structures, easy subject-initial SOV structures and more difficult object-initial OSV structures. One speaker, the SOV-Speaker, had a high proportion of SOV sentences (75%) and a low proportion of OSV sentences (25%), and vice-versa for the OSV-Speaker. Participants were exposed to the speakers' individual language use in a training session followed by a test session on the consecutive day. ERP-results show that early stages of sentence processing are driven by syntactic processing only and are unaffected by speaker-specific expectations. In a late stage, however, an interaction between speaker and syntax information was observed. For the SOV-Speaker condition, the classical P600-effect reflected the effort of processing difficult and unexpected sentence structures. For the OSV-Speaker condition, both structures elicited different responses on frontal electrodes, possibly indexing effort to switch from a local speaker model to a global model of language use. Overall, the study identifies distinct neural mechanisms related to speaker-specific expectations.",2021,Aug,Cortex,141,,311-321,34118750.0,10.1016/j.cortex.2021.04.017,,#1199,Kroczek 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The Effects of Bug-in-the-Eye Supervision on Therapeutic Alliance and Therapist Competence in Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Weck, F.; Jakob, M.; Neng, J. M.; Hofling, V.; Grikscheit, F.; Bohus, M.","Live supervision enables a supervisor to have direct insight into the psychotherapeutic process and allows him or her to provide immediate feedback to the trainee. Therefore, live supervision might be superior to traditional supervisory formats that only allow for the provision of delayed feedback. When considering the different live supervision formats, bug-in-the-eye (BITE) supervision is particularly promising because of its improved and less invasive procedure. The current study compared the efficacy of BITE supervision with that of delayed video-based (DVB) supervision. In the present study, 23 therapists were randomly assigned to either the BITE supervision or DVB supervision groups. The participants were psychotherapy trainees who treated 42 patients (19 under BITE supervision and 23 under DVB supervision) over 25 sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy. Two independent raters blind to the treatment conditions evaluated therapeutic alliance and therapist competence based on 195 videotapes. Therapeutic alliance was significantly stronger among the treatments conducted under BITE supervision than those conducted under DVB supervision. Moreover, a higher level of therapeutic competence was found in the BITE condition than in the DVB condition. However, no differences between supervision conditions were found when the results were controlled for the level of therapeutic alliance and therapist competence demonstrated in the first session. No differences were observed between the supervision conditions with respect to patient outcomes. There is evidence that BITE supervision is able to improve therapeutic alliance and therapist competence. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because possible pre-treatment differences between therapists might explain the superiority of BITE supervision.

What the future holds: Machine learning to predict success in psychotherapy,"Taubitz, F. S.; Budenbender, B.; Alpers, G. W.","Machine learning (ML) may help to predict successful psychotherapy outcomes and to identify relevant predictors of success. So far, ML applications are scant in psychotherapy research and they are typically based on small samples or focused on specific diagnoses. In this study, we predict successful therapy outcomes with ML in a heterogeneous sample in routine outpatient care. We trained established ML models (decision trees and ensembles of them) with routinely collected clinical baseline information from n = 685 outpatients to predict a successful outcome of cognitive behavioral therapy. Treatment success was defined as clinically significant change (CSC) on the Brief-Symptom-Checklist (reached by 326 patients; 48%). The best performing model (Gradient Boosting Machines) achieved a balanced accuracy of 69% (p < .001) on unseen validation data. Out of 383 variables, we identified the 16 most important predictors, which were still able to predict CSC with 67% balanced accuracy. Our study demonstrates that ML models built on data, which is typically available at the outset of therapy, can predict whether an individual will substantially benefit from the intervention. Some of the predictors were theoretically expected (e.g., level of functioning), but others need further validation (e.g., somatization). From a theoretical and practical perspective, ML is clearly an attractive addition to more established psychotherapy research methodology.",2022,Sep,Behav Res Ther,156,,104116,35715257.0,10.1016/j.brat.2022.104116,,#1202,Taubitz 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Specificity of resting-state heart rate variability in psychosis: A comparison with clinical high risk, anxiety, and healthy controls","Clamor, A.; Sundag, J.; Lincoln, T. M.","Maladaptability, particularly of autonomic activity, is described as a central component of vulnerability-stress-models for the pathogenesis of psychotic symptoms. Investigating heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of autonomic adaptability is thus likely to improve our understanding of psychosis. In clinically vulnerable groups for psychosis, it is unclear whether maladaptability is already evident. Moreover, to investigate specificity, direct comparisons to other mental disorders are required. In the present study, we analyzed 3 min of resting-state heart rate, HRV, and negative affect in 130 participants; consisting of participants with psychotic disorders (PSY; n = 44), clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR; n = 22), anxiety disorders (anxiety controls, AC; n = 29) and healthy controls (HC; n = 35). ANCOVAs controlling for age revealed significant group differences for both investigated vagal HRV parameters, which were reduced in PSY compared to HC. The high-frequency domain HRV in PSY was also lower than in CHR and - in a non-significant trend - than in AC. Also, ANOVAs for heart rate and negative affect revealed significant increases in PSY compared to HC. Exploratory analyses of medication effects showed moderate dosage associations with heart rate and high-frequency HRV. Thus, in the present study, the activity of the autonomic nervous system was altered in psychosis but not in an at-risk group. A potential specificity of the effect can be speculated in contrast to anxiety disorders. Future studies should investigate the predictive value of HRV for increased stress-sensitivity or transition to clinical symptoms as well as the implications for daily threat perception and symptom maintenance.",2019,Apr,Schizophr Res,206,,89-95,30573408.0,10.1016/j.schres.2018.12.009,,#1203,Clamor 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Incentive-based extinction of safety behaviors: Positive outcomes competing with aversive outcomes trigger fear-opposite action to prevent protection from fear extinction,"Pittig, A.","Maladaptive safety behavior maintains fear and anxiety by prohibiting inhibitory learning about the non-occurrence of feared outcomes (known as protection from extinction). Not engaging in safety behavior, however, requires to act opposite to fear-motivated behavioral tendencies. The initiation of such fear-opposite action by positive outcomes, which were in conflict with safety behavior, was tested. Following fear acquisition to a warning signal (CS+), participants acquired safety behavior to prevent the aversive outcome (n = 48). Next, safety behavior also prevented gaining rewards. In a control group (n = 50), neutral outcomes were presented to control for novelty effects of the second outcome. Subsequently, no aversive outcome occurred anymore. Phases with safety behavior were intermitted by phases without safety behavior being available to examine cognitive and physiological indicators of fear and anxiety. Without competing positive outcomes, safety behavior was frequently executed, persisted in absence of the aversive outcome, and prohibited extinction learning. Positive outcomes clearly reduced safety behavior despite equal levels of acquired fear. This enabled fear extinction as soon as the aversive outcome was absent. Importantly, this extinction learning resulted in attenuated fear and anxiety responses when safety behavior became unavailable. Post-hoc findings indicated that the mere anticipation of positive outcomes slightly reduced safety behavior. Thus, competing positive outcomes triggered fear-opposite action that prevented persistent safety behavior and protection from extinction.",2019,Oct,Behav Res Ther,121,,103463,31476447.0,10.1016/j.brat.2019.103463,,#1204,Pittig 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Fuel to the fire: The escalating interplay of attachment and maltreatment in the transgenerational transmission of psychopathology in families living in refugee camps,"Scharpf, F.; Mkinga, G.; Neuner, F.; Machumu, M.; Hecker, T.","Maltreatment by parents can be conceptualized as pathogenic escalations of a disturbed parent-child relationship that have devastating consequences for children's development and mental health. Although parental psychopathology has been shown to be a risk factor both for maltreatment and insecure attachment representations, these factors; joint contribution to child psychopathology has not been investigated. In a sample of Burundian refugee families living in refugee camps in Western Tanzania, the associations between attachment representations, maltreatment, and psychopathology were examined by conducting structured interviews with 226 children aged 7 to 15 and both their parents. Structural equation modeling revealed that children's insecure attachment representations and maltreatment by mothers fully mediated the relation between maternal and child psychopathology [model fit: comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.96; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05]. A direct association between paternal and child psychopathology was observed (model fit: CFI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.05). The findings suggest a vicious cycle, wherein an insecure attachment to a mother suffering from psychopathology may be linked to children's risk to be maltreated, which may reinforce insecure representations and perpetuate the pathogenic relational experience.

"No matter of etiology: biogenetic, psychosocial and vulnerability-stress causal explanations fail to improve attitudes towards schizophrenia","Schlier, B.; Schmick, S.; Lincoln, T. M.","Many anti-stigma campaigns emphasize biogenetic causes to convey that schizophrenia is an ""illness like others"". A growing body of studies shows that although biogenetic explanations reduce blame, they tend to reinforce prognostic pessimism and harsher treatment of people with schizophrenia. In contrast, psychosocial explanations attenuate prognostic pessimism and perceived otherness, but seem less suitable to reduce blame. We hypothesized that a vulnerability-stress model that combines biogenetic and psychosocial explanations would yield clearer stigma-reducing effects than the mono-causal models. In an online-experiment, 416 participants from the general population randomly received either a vulnerability-stress, biogenetic, psychosocial or control-intervention, which consisted of information text and video presentation of a case-example. Causal beliefs, stereotypes and desired social distance were assessed by self-report. Baseline causal beliefs were weakly associated with stereotypes. The vulnerability-stress intervention did not reduce stigma more effectively than the biogenetic or psychosocial intervention and was less effective in reducing perceived blame than the biogenetic intervention. Compared to the control-intervention, no intervention showed significant stigma-reducing effects, but the psychosocial and vulnerability-stress conditions both increased blame. We found no evidence for vulnerability-stress explanations as a mean to reduce stigma. We propose further research to identify more effective ways to tackle stigma.",2014,Mar 30,Psychiatry Res,215,3,753-9,24485063.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2013.12.056,,#1208,Schlier 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Evaluation of an eye tracking setup for studying visual attention in face-to-face conversations,"Vehlen, A.; Spenthof, I.; Tonsing, D.; Heinrichs, M.; Domes, G.","Many eye tracking studies use facial stimuli presented on a display to investigate attentional processing of social stimuli. To introduce a more realistic approach that allows interaction between two real people, we evaluated a new eye tracking setup in three independent studies in terms of data quality, short-term reliability and feasibility. Study 1 measured the robustness, precision and accuracy for calibration stimuli compared to a classical display-based setup. Study 2 used the identical measures with an independent study sample to compare the data quality for a photograph of a face (2D) and the face of the real person (3D). Study 3 evaluated data quality over the course of a real face-to-face conversation and examined the gaze behavior on the facial features of the conversation partner. Study 1 provides evidence that quality indices for the scene-based setup were comparable to those of a classical display-based setup. Average accuracy was better than 0.4 degrees visual angle. Study 2 demonstrates that eye tracking quality is sufficient for 3D stimuli and robust against short interruptions without re-calibration. Study 3 confirms the long-term stability of tracking accuracy during a face-to-face interaction and demonstrates typical gaze patterns for facial features. Thus, the eye tracking setup presented here seems feasible for studying gaze behavior in dyadic face-to-face interactions. Eye tracking data obtained with this setup achieves an accuracy that is sufficient for investigating behavior such as eye contact in social interactions in a range of populations including clinical conditions, such as autism spectrum and social phobia.",2021,Jan 29,Sci Rep,11,1,2661,33514767.0,10.1038/s41598-021-81987-x,,#1209,Vehlen 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
The Benefits of Physical Activity and Positive Mental Health for Reducing the Burden of COVID-19: Validation from a Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Investigation in China and Germany,"Brailovskaia, J.; Zhang, X.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal (China: N = 474, baseline, BL: 2015, follow-up, FU: 2020; Germany: N = 359, BL: 2019, FU: 2020) data on physical activity (e.g., jogging) (BL/FU), positive mental health (PMH) (BL/FU), and burden by COVID-19 (FU) were collected via online surveys. In both countries, physical activity was positively associated with PMH, and both variables were negatively related to burden by COVID-19. Furthermore, PMH mediated the link between physical activity and burden. The mediation model was significant when physical activity and PMH were assessed at the BL, while burden was measured at the FU; and it was also significant when all variables were assessed at the FU. The present findings reveal that physical activity in combination with PMH can reduce the experience of burden by COVID-19.

Incremental validity of the ICD-11 personality disorder model for explaining psychological distress,"Stricker, J.; Pietrowsky, R.","Many persons with personality disorder experience psychological distress. The International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11) contains a dimensional personality disorder model that comprises personality dysfunctioning, 5 maladaptive personality trait domains, and a borderline pattern qualifier. Research on the relations between the ICD-11 personality disorder model and psychological distress is sparse. Particularly, it is unclear whether personality dysfunctioning on the one side and the more specific personality traits in ICD-11 on the other side incrementally predict psychological distress. In addition, the incremental validity of the components of the ICD-11 personality disorder model beyond the five-factor model of normal-range personality as a widely accepted personality framework has not been established. In this study, we assessed the relations between self-report measures of the ICD-11 personality disorder model and psychological distress in 2 community samples (N(Sample 1) = 203, N(Sample 2) = 226). Except anankastia, all ICD-11 personality trait domains assessed with the Personality Inventory for ICD-11 and the borderline pattern qualifier assessed with the Borderline Pattern Scale were strongly related to psychological distress. In hierarchical regressions, the personality traits in ICD-11 incrementally predicted psychological distress beyond personality dysfunctioning, and vice versa. In addition, the components of the ICD-11 personality disorder model were substantially related to psychological distress beyond the corresponding normal-range Big Five personality traits. Our results demonstrate the criterion-related and incremental validity of self-report instruments assessing the ICD-11 personality disorder model, which supports their utility for screening and assessment.

Individual Variability of Pleasantness Ratings to Stroking Touch Over Different Velocities,"Croy, I.; Bierling, A.; Sailer, U.; Ackerley, R.","Many studies have investigated the perception of tactile pleasantness over a range of stroking velocities. On average, pleasantness is low at slow (e.g. 0.3 cm/s) and fast (e.g. 30 cm/s) stroking velocities, but is rated highest at velocities between 1 and 10 cm/s. On a group level, this results in an inverted-U shape pleasantness ratings curve, which is described statistically by a negative quadratic equation. We reanalyzed the data from five earlier studies to investigate whether the inverted-U shape pleasantness curve at the group level is also present at the level of the individual, - a precondition for using tactile pleasantness perception as a diagnostic marker. We pooled the data from five studies with a total of 127 participants. Each study included a 'standard condition' of stroking on the dorsal forearm over different velocities (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 cm/s) and participants rated the pleasantness. Factors other than stroking velocity were also varied in these studies. On the whole-group level and in each study, pleasantness ratings produced a significant negative quadratic pleasantness curve over the stroking velocities. In individual participants, ratings varied greatly and only 42% of the participants showed a significant negative quadratic curve. The steepness of the inverted-U correlated only moderately across other experimental conditions, showing that the experimental circumstances can influence pleasantness ratings. Our findings have important implications for future work, where differences in the tactile pleasantness curve should not be used to predict or diagnose issues at an individual level.",2021,Jun 1,Neuroscience,464,,33-43,32224227.0,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.03.030,,#1212,Croy 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Maternal depression was assessed 3 to 4 months postpartum with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), bonding with the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire, and maternal attachment style with the Attachment Style Interview. Women with current and lifetime depression as well as women with dual/disorganized attachment style reported lower bonding. Explorative analysis revealed that depression partially mediated the link between dual/disorganized attachment style and bonding with a medium-sized mediation effect.

Learning by doing? The effect of gestures on implicit retrieval of newly acquired words,"Kronke, K. M.; Mueller, K.; Friederici, A. D.; Obrig, H.","Meaningful gestures enhance speech comprehensibility. However, their role during novel-word acquisition remains elusive. Here we investigate how meaningful versus meaningless gestures impact on novel-word learning and contrast these conditions to a purely verbal training. After training, neuronal processing of the novel words was assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI), disclosing that networks affording retrieval differ depending on the training condition. Over 3 days participants learned pseudowords for common objects (e.g., /klira/ -cap). For training they repeated the novel word while performing (i) an iconic, (ii) a grooming or (iii) no gesture. For the two conditions involving gestures, these were either actively repeated or passively observed during training. Behaviorally no substantial differences between the five different training conditions were found while fMRI disclosed differential networks affording implicit retrieval of the learned pseudowords depending on the training procedure. Most notably training with actively performed iconic gestures yielded larger activation in a semantic network comprising left inferior frontal (BA47) and inferior temporal gyri. Additionally hippocampal activation was stronger for all trained compared to unknown pseudowords of identical structure. The behavioral results challenge the generality of an 'enactment-effect' for single word learning. Imaging results, however, suggest that actively performed meaningful gestures lead to a deeper semantic encoding of novel words. The findings are discussed regarding their implications for theoretical accounts and for empirical approaches of gesture-based strategies in language (re)learning.",2013,Oct,Cortex,49,9,2553-68,23357203.0,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.11.016,,#1215,Kronke 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Testing for a potential role of semantic elaboration using meaningful stimuli in an encoding task without verbal labels, we found evidence of spontaneous semantic processing irrespective of self- or other-assignment. When semantic organization was manipulated, the MOE vanished if a semantic classification task was added to the self/other assignment but persisted for a perceptual classification task. Furthermore, we found greater clustering of self-assigned than of other-assigned items in free recall. Taken together, these results suggest that the MOE could be based on the organizational principle of a ""me"" versus ""not-me"" categorization.",2016,Nov,Conscious Cogn,46,,71-88,27684608.0,10.1016/j.concog.2016.09.007,,#1216,Englert 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Keep calm! Gender differences in mental rotation performance are modulated by habitual expressive suppression,"Fladung, A. K.; Kiefer, M.","Men have been frequently found to perform more accurately than women in mental rotation tasks. However, men and women also differ with regard to the habitual use of emotion regulation strategies, particularly with regard to expressive suppression, i.e., the suppression of emotional expression in behavior. As emotional suppression is more often used by men, emotion regulation strategies might be a variable modulating gender differences in mental rotation performance. The present study, therefore, examined the influences of gender and emotion regulation strategies on mental rotation performance accuracy and feedback processing. Twenty-eight men and 28 women matched for relevant demographic variables performed mental rotation tasks of varying difficulty over a prolonged time. Emotional feedback was given immediately after each trial. Results showed that women reported to use expressive suppression less frequently than men. Women made more errors in the mental rotation task than men confirming earlier demonstrations of gender differences. Furthermore, women were more impaired by the negative feedback as indicated by the increased likelihood of subsequent errors compared with men. Task performance of women not habitually using expressive suppression was most inferior and most strongly influenced by failure feedback compared with men. Women using expressive suppression more habitually did not significantly differ in mental rotation accuracy and feedback processing from men.

Global prevalence estimates range between 10 and 20%. Most MHP manifest by adolescence and persistence rates are high, often accumulating further impairment in early adulthood and beyond. We analyzed data of N = 433 participants from the German longitudinal BELLA study to examine whether MHP in adolescence negatively affect educational attainment in early adulthood. Externalizing and internalizing MHP among adolescents aged 11-17 years were assessed at baseline using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Educational attainment was assessed at the 6-year follow-up based on level of education, failure to attain the expected level of education, and dropout from vocational or academic training. Findings from logistic regression analyses suggest that more pronounced externalizing MHP in adolescence predict a lower level of education in early adulthood. We did not find a corresponding effect for internalizing MHP. Adolescents with higher-educated parents were less likely to attain a lower level of education themselves and less likely to fail in attaining their expected level of education. Our findings support that educational attainment presents a central channel for intergenerational reproduction of education and forms an important pathway for upward, but also downward social mobility.

[Metacognitions and interoceptive sensibility in the perception of premonitory urges in tic disorders across the lifespan],"Schutteler, C.; Gerlach, A. L.","Metacognitions and interoceptive sensibility in the perception of premonitory urges in tic disorders across the lifespan Abstract. Objective: Depending on contextual factors, the prevalence of premonitory urges (PU) in patients with tic disorders (TD) increases with age and varies both intra- and interindividually. In youth, PUs correlate with metacognitions. In both youth and adults, interoceptive sensibility is altered compared to healthy controls. We examined the relationship between PUs, tics, metacognitions, and interoceptive sensibility across the lifespan regarding tic severity. Method: In an online survey, 53 participants reported their PUs on the Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS) and tic severity on the Symptom Checklist for Tic Disorders (SBB-TIC). We assessed interoceptive sensibility via the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ-A) and metacognitions regarding tics with the Belief About Tics Scale (BATS). Results: Adults scored higher on the PUTS than youth. In youth, interoceptive sensibility increased with age; interoceptive sensibility correlated with PUTS. Metacognitions and interoceptive sensibility explained a significant amount of variance in premonitory urges, even after controlling for tic severity and age. Conclusions: The presumed cause of age-dependent development of PUs in youth lies in their neurophysiological maturing processes. However, negative metacognitions and interoceptive abilities also play an important role in the development and maintenance of PU and might be of therapeutic use in the treatment of TD.",2022,Nov 18,Z Kinder Jugendpsychiatr Psychother,,,,36398570.0,10.1024/1422-4917/a000910,,#1221,Schutteler 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

A sample of 27 children between 8 and 16 years of age with a primary diagnosis of specific phobia, separation-anxiety disorder or social phobia completed assessments of anxiety symptoms, metacognitive beliefs, worry and repetitive negative thoughts before and after 11 sessions of intensified exposure treatment. Metacognitive beliefs did not change significantly after intensified exposure, but post-hoc power analysis revealed a lack of power here. Change in negative metacognitive beliefs correlated with a change in anxiety symptoms, but did not independently contribute as a predictor variable. Differences between subsamples showed that patients with separation-anxiety disorder scored higher on negative metacognitive beliefs than those with specific or social phobia. Consideration of metacognition, and negative metacognitive beliefs in particular could help us further improve the understanding and treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents and should therefore receive more attention in psychotherapy research.",2022,Jan 28,Children (Basel),9,2,168,35204889.0,10.3390/children9020168,,#1222,Kocher 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Metacognitive Change During Exposure and Metacognitive Therapy in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,"Hansmeier, J.; Haberkamp, A.; Glombiewski, J.

The current study investigates, (1) if treatment with MCT or exposure and response prevention (ERP) in a randomized-controlled pilot trial (n = 24 patients with OCD) changes OCD-specific metacognitions of thought fusion beliefs, beliefs about rituals and stop signals, and (2) if these changes are relevant for the treatment outcome in terms of patient- and therapist-rated OCD symptoms. ANOVA with pretest, posttest and follow-up scores could show that all three metacognitions significantly decreased during both treatments. Regarding thought fusion beliefs, a significant interaction effect indicated a higher decrease after MCT than ERP treatment. In hierarchical regression analyses, changes in stop signals from pre- to post-treatment significantly predicted patient-rating OCD symptoms at post-treatment and follow-up at 3 months after treatment. These changes were even predictive of post-treatment outcome after controlling for general metacognitions and dysfunctional cognitive beliefs.

However, little is known about normative neural processes accompanying psychosocial stress at this time. Previous research found that emotion regulation strategies critically influence the relationship between stress and the development of psychiatric symptoms during adolescence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined neural responses to acute stress and analyzed whether the tendency to use adaptive or maladaptive emotion regulation strategies is related to neural and autonomic stress responses. Results show large linear activation increases from low to medium to high stress levels mainly in medial prefrontal, insulae and temporal areas. Caudate and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, neural areas related to reward and affective valuations, showed linearly decreasing activation. In line with our hypothesis, the current adolescent neural stress profile resembled social rejection and was characterized by pronounced activation in insula, angular and temporal cortices. Moreover, results point to an intriguing role of the anterior temporal gyrus. Stress-related activity in the anterior temporal gyrus was positively related to maladaptive regulation strategies and stress-induced autonomic activity. Maladaptive coping might increase the social threat and reappraisal load of a stressor, relating to higher stress sensitivity of anterior temporal cortices.",2023,Feb,Dev Psychopathol,35,1,332-344,34365995.0,10.1017/S0954579421000572,,#1224,Golde 2023,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Disentangling the Sources of Mimicry: Social Relations Analyses of the Link Between Mimicry and Liking,"Salazar Kampf, M.; Liebermann, H.; Kerschreiter, R.; Krause, S.; Nestler, S.; Schmukle, S. C.","Mimicry is an important interpersonal behavior for initiating and maintaining relationships. By observing the same participants ( N = 139) in multiple dyadic interactions (618 data points) in a round-robin design, we disentangled the extent to which mimicry is due to (a) the mimicker's general tendency to mimic (imitativity), (b) the mimickee's general tendency to evoke mimicry (imitatability), and (c) the unique dyadic relationship between the mimicker and the mimickee. We explored how these mimicry components affected liking and metaperceptions of liking (i.e., metaliking). Employing social relations models, we found substantial interindividual differences in imitativity, which predicted popularity. However, we found only small interindividual differences in imitatability. We found support for our proposition that mimicry is a substantially dyadic construct explained mostly by the unique relationship between two people.

Effects of a Mindfulness Task on Women's Sexual Response,"Velten, J.; Margraf, J.; Chivers, M. L.; Brotto, L. A.","Mindfulness-based interventions are effective at improving symptoms of sexual dysfunction in women. The mechanisms by which mindfulness improves sexual function are less clear. The main objective of our study was to investigate the impact of a mindfulness task on sexual response in women. Forty-one women (mean age = 27.2, SD = 5.6) participated in two laboratory sessions that each included two erotic films and one attention task that were presented in counterbalanced order. Both attention tasks consisted of a six-minute audio recording of either a modified body scan, focusing on genital arousal sensations (mindfulness condition), or a visualization exercise. Subjective and genital sexual arousal were measured continuously during stimulus presentation. The mindfulness task led to greater subjective and lower genital arousal. The agreement of subjective and genital sexual arousal (i.e., concordance) was greater in the mindfulness condition. Trait mindfulness was related to lower sexual arousal but also greater sexual concordance in women. Mindfulness-based interventions that encourage women to focus on physical arousal sensations in the here and now may be associated with women's improved sexual function by enhancing feelings of sexual arousal during sexual activity and by increasing concordance between subjective and genital sexual arousal.",2018,Jul-Aug,J Sex Res,55,6,747-757,29261339.0,10.1080/00224499.2017.1408768,,#1229,Velten 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Effects of full-body mirror exposure on eating pathology, body image and emotional states: Comparison between positive and negative verbalization","Tanck, J. A.; Hartmann, A. S.; Svaldi, J.; Vocks, S.","Mirror exposure (ME) is an effective technique to improve body image. However, evidence on the underlying mechanisms and the optimal verbalization instruction during ME is lacking. Therefore, this experimental study analyzed mechanisms of ME and therapeutic outcomes by comparing positive (PV) and negative (NV) full-body verbalization. N = 73 healthy females were randomized to a PV or an NV condition. PV participants verbalized positively while NV participants verbalized negatively about their whole body. Each participant underwent three standardized ME sessions. Before and after each ME session, positive affect, negative affect and body satisfaction were assessed. Before the first and after the third ME, participants completed questionnaires on cognitive-affective and behavioral aspects of body image, eating pathology and self-esteem. Regarding within-ME changes, the results indicate that positive affect and body satisfaction decreased while negative affect increased in the NV group but not in the PV group. In contrast, regarding between-ME changes, decreased negative affect as well as positive affect and increased body satisfaction were observed in both groups. However, eating pathology remained stable, whereas body-checking behavior increased and the PV condition was followed by higher levels of self-esteem compared to the NV condition. These findings suggest that both PV and NV improve negative affect and body satisfaction between-ME, and thus seem to be effective ME instructions. Given that NV led to increased negative affect within-ME and did not influence self-esteem, PV might represent the favorable instruction during ME for body-satisfied women.",2021,2021/09/13,PLOS ONE,16,9,e0257303,34516591.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0257303,,#1230,Tanck 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Testing a gamified Spider App to reduce spider fear and avoidance,"Haberkamp, A.; Walter, H.; Althaus, P.; Schmuck, M.; Rief, W.; Schmidt, F.","Mobile applications are increasingly part of mental health programs and various apps have been developed for treating anxiety disorders. Typically, they aim to improve anxiety symptoms via established CBT techniques, such as exposure principles, which are considered extremely unpleasant for fearful individuals. We combined in a mobile application exposure principles with gamification elements (e.g. narrative background, level progression, points, and feedback). These elements should increase the motivation for confronting spider images and decrease the experienced distress. To evaluate the application, two groups of spider-fearful individuals played either the Spider App (experimental group) or a non-spider associated app (control group) twice a day for approximately 12 min for 7 days.

Taking a Closer Look at Social Performance in Childhood Social Anxiety Disorder: Biopsychosocial Context Considerations and Effects of Cognitive Behavior Therapy,"Asbrand, J.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.","Models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) describe shortfalls in child social performance, whereas empirically, children often show a deficit only in subjective and not objective performance. We examined social performance in relation to possible changes (before and after cognitive behavior therapy [CBT] including social skills training) and to an objective parameter (vocal arousal). Children with SAD were expected to subjectively judge their behavior as less competent than healthy control (HC) children despite a lack of objective differences. Children receiving CBT were expected to show a change in subjective and objective social performance in comparison to children waiting for treatment. Exploratory correlation analyses were used to disentangle the relation between social performance and vocal arousal. One hundred and nineteen children (64 with and 55 without SAD; aged 9-13 years) completed a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Children with SAD participated in a second TSST after CBT or waiting. Performance was assessed by self-report and by blinded observers. Vocal arousal was analyzed by audio recording. Children with SAD were objectively assessed as more socially competent than HC children; subjectively, children with SAD showed lower social performance. CBT showed no effect on subjective or objective performance ratings. Vocal arousal did not correlate with social performance. Results need to be considered carefully, as psychometric problems appeared that had not been considered in previous studies. The surprising lack of CBT effects suggests a need to focus on cognitions surrounding social performance.

So far, limited research has been conducted in children with SAD in experimental stress designs. Thus, examining autonomic arousal, children with and without SAD completed a standardized social stressor (Trier Social Stress Test for Children-C; TSST-C). Pre-existing differences to healthy controls (HC) were expected to decrease after receiving cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Children with SAD (n = 64) and HC children (n = 55) completed a TSST-C. Children with SAD participated in a second TSST-C after either cognitive-behavioral treatment or a waitlist-control period (WLC). As expected, children with SAD showed blunted heart rate reactivity compared to HC children. Further, children with SAD had elevated levels of tonic sympathetic arousal as indexed by skin conductance level compared to HC. Children with SAD showed lower parasympathetic arousal during the baseline compared to HC. Children receiving treatment did not differ from children in the WLC condition in a repeated social stress test. Psychophysiological differences between children with SAD and HC children could be confirmed as indicated by previous research.

Electrocortical correlates of impaired motor inhibition and outcome processing are related in high binge-watching,"Dieterich, R.; Wullhorst, V.; Berghauser, J.; Overmeyer, R.; Endrass, T.","Models posit problematic binge-watching to involve a vicious circle of low motivation for alternative activities, low sensitivity for the consequences of neglected goals, and low self-control. As such, simultaneously impaired feedback and inhibitory functioning might contribute to binge-watching. We tested the hypothesis that blunted feedback-related brain activity is coupled with attenuated inhibitory brain activity in binge-watchers. High (n = 32) and non-binge-watchers (n = 31) performed go/nogo (inhibition) and stop signal (stopping) tasks and a flanker paradigm with performance feedback during electroencephalography. We examined how neural correlates of inhibition and stopping were associated with outcome processing in each group. We assessed the temporospatial relationship using a single-trial regression approach. High binge-watchers, but not non-binge-watchers, who differentiated less between gains and losses at the neural level (feedback-P3b) also recruited less brain activity during both inhibition and stopping (inhibition-P3 and stopping-P3). Exploratory analyses suggested that these relationships were most prominent in high binge-watchers with high loss of control over watching. Main effects of the group in performance or EEG did not emerge. These results suggest a potentially problematic interaction between outcome and inhibitory functions in binge-watchers. Insensitivity to behavioral consequences along with inhibitory impairments may also confer a long-term risk for compulsive watching.

We presented emotional stimuli in the same environment as the virtual body. Participants experienced higher arousal, dominance, and more intense valence in the high embodiment condition compared to the low embodiment condition.

The mental health of forcibly displaced couples,"Mahmood, H. N.; Ibrahim, H.; Ismail, A.

However, there is reason to assume that trauma-related symptoms within couples are influenced by each partner's risk factors and symptoms. Using the actor-partner interdependence model, this study aimed to test whether symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were predicted by participants' partner's exposure to traumatic events over and above the influence of the participant's own experiences. For this purpose, we interviewed 687 heterosexual, married Iraqi and Syrian couples in Iraq's Kurdistan region who had been forcefully displaced. We assessed symptoms of PTSD and depression using locally validated scales. Nearly all participants (98.8%) reported exposure to at least one traumatic event, with husbands reporting exposure to a higher number of traumatic events than wives, d = 0.48, p < .001. More than half of the participants met the criteria for a probable PTSD (61.1%) or major depressive disorder diagnosis (60.4%). Within couples, significant actor effects of experienced trauma exposure on personal PTSD and depressive symptoms were observed for both husbands and wives. Further, there were significant partner effects of wives' traumatic experiences on husbands' PTSD and depressive symptoms as well as of husbands' traumatic experiences on wives' PTSD and depressive symptoms.

Predictors of Prolonged Grief Disorder in a German Representative Population Sample: Unexpectedness of Bereavement Contributes to Grief Severity and Prolonged Grief Disorder,"Doering, B.

Identifying grievers at risk of PGD may enable specific prevention measures. The present study examined the extent to which the subjective unexpectedness of the death predicted grief outcomes above and beyond known sociodemographic and objective loss-related variables in a sample drawn from a population-representative investigation. In our sample (n = 2,531), 811 participants (M (age) 55.1 +/- 17.8 years, 59.2% women) had experienced the loss of a significant person six or more months ago. Participants provided demographic and loss-related information, perceptions of the unexpectedness of the death and completed the Prolonged Grief Disorder-13 + 9 (PG-13 + 9). The PG-13 + 9 was used to determine PGD caseness. A binary logistic regression investigated predictors of PGD caseness, and a linear regression predictors of grief severity. ANCOVAs compared PGD symptoms between the groups who had experienced an ""expected"" vs. ""unexpected"" loss, while controlling for the relationship to the deceased and time since loss. The loss of a child (OR = 23.66; 95%CI, 6.03-68.28), or a partner (OR = 5.32; 95%CI, 1.79-15.83), the time since loss (OR = 0.99; 95%CI, 0.99-1.00) and the unexpectedness of the death (OR = 3.58; 95%CI, 1.70-7.69) were significant predictors of PGD caseness (Nagelkerke's R(2) = 0.25) and grief severity. Participants who had experienced the loss as unexpected (vs. expected) reported higher scores on all PGD symptoms. Unexpectedness of the death emerged as significant risk factor for PGD, even after controlling for demographic and other loss-related variables. While our findings replicate previous research on the importance of the relationship to the deceased as a risk factor for PGD, they also highlight the importance of assessing the subjective unexpectedness of a death and may help to identify risk groups who can profit from preventive interventions.",2022,2022/04/26,Front Psychiatry,13,,853698,35558417.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.853698,,#1238,Doering 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"The socially evaluated handgrip test: Introduction of a novel, time-efficient stress protocol","Finke, J. B.; Kalinowski, G. I.; Larra, M.

Moreover, while known to reliably induce HPA axis activation, especially when combined with social self-threat, most conventional laboratory stressors cannot be flexibly adapted to elicit either a mainly autonomic or an additional endocrine stress response. Being a promising alternative approach, a new version of the isometric handgrip test enriched by a social-evaluative component was evaluated in the present study. On two consecutive sessions, forty participants (20 women) performed a handgrip task at both 45% (stress) and 10% (control) of maximum voluntary isometric contraction lasting for 3min. During the stress test, continuous visual feedback on performance was given. Participants in the social-evaluative condition (50%) were observed and evaluated by a previously unknown person of the opposite sex, whereas in the standard condition feedback was provided via a computer monitor. Cardiovascular measures (heart rate, blood pressure) as well as additional indices of autonomic reactivity (skin conductance, heart-rate variability) were registered before, during, and after stress induction. Moreover, changes in salivary cortisol and in subjective well-being were assessed. Relative to control, significant increases in cardiovascular and sympathetic activity were found, irrespective of experimental group. Importantly, however, additional social evaluation resulted in elevated cortisol levels. Furthermore, evidence for reduced vagal tone during sustained socially evaluated handgrip emerged. In conclusion, the socially evaluated handgrip test represents a versatile, time-efficient method to induce stress in small laboratory settings.",2018,Jan,Psychoneuroendocrinology,87,,141-146,29073513.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.10.013,,#1239,Finke 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Mother-child bonding is associated with the maternal perception of the child's body odor,"Croy, I.; Mohr, T.; Weidner, K.; Hummel, T.; Junge-Hoffmeister, J.","Mothers can recognize the odor of their baby and typically adore this odor. In line with this observation, infant body odors activate reward-related brain areas in the mothers. In some mother-child-dyads however, the mutual bond is impaired and mothers have trouble engaging in interaction with their child. We aimed to examine how mothers with bonding difficulties perceive their child's body odor. In total, 75 mothers of babies aged 0-12 months were examined: Twenty-five of those were recruited in a psychosomatic day hospital ward, which is specialized for mother-child bonding disorders. Fifty age-matched healthy women and their babies served as controls. Body odor samples of each baby were collected from bodysuits in a highly standardized procedure. Thereafter, each mother rated the samples of her own and two other infants in a blind and randomized design. In addition, general olfactory function in terms of threshold and identification ability was tested and the mother reported the bonding to her baby in a standardized questionnaire. Healthy mothers showed a clear preference of their own compared to odors of other infant's, while mothers with bonding difficulties did not. Furthermore, the degree of preference was negatively correlated to self-reported bonding difficulties. Mothers with bonding difficulties could not identify their own infant's odor above chance, while control mothers could. Both groups did not differ in general olfactory function. We assume that reduced close body contact and interaction time associated with bonding difficulties may lead to reduced exposure and hinder the recognition of the infantile body odor. Within a vicious cycle, a reduced hedonic experience smelling their own baby may prevent women from deliberately approaching the baby. Thus, the positive and bond-building consequences of bodily and sensory interaction cannot unfold. As the baby's odor is normally perceived as very pleasant and rewarding, the conscious perception of the infantile body odor may be an additive therapeutic approach for mothers with bonding difficulties.",2019,Jan 1,Physiol Behav,198,,151-157,30261171.0,10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.09.014,,#1240,Croy 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Children's Body Odors: Hints to the Development Status,"Schafer, L.; Sorokowska, A.; Weidner, K.; Croy, I.","Mothers can recognize their own children by body odor. Besides signaling familiarity, children's body odors may provide other information relevant to maternal caregiving behavior, such as the child's developmental status. Thus, we explored whether mothers are able to classify body odors on pre- vs. postpubertal status above chance levels. In total, 164 mothers were presented with body odor samples of their own and four unfamiliar, sex-matched children who varied in age (range 0-18 years). Pubertal status was measured by (a) determining the child's steroid hormone level and (b) parental assessment of the child's developmental stage using the Pubertal Development Scale. Mothers classified developmental status with an accuracy of about 64%. Maternal assessments were biased toward pre-puberty. Classification was predicted by perceptual evaluation of the body odor (i.e. intensity and pleasantness) and by the child's developmental stage, but not by hormones. In specific, mothers with pubertal-aged children classified body odors using the child's developmental status, whereas mothers with younger children only classified body odors using perceptual information (i.e. intensity and pleasantness).

Nonetheless, it remains a matter of debate whether motivation effects on the visual cortex depend on the spatial attention system, or rely on independent pathways. This study investigated the impact of motivation and spatial attention on the activity of the human primary and extrastriate visual cortex by employing a factorial manipulation of the two factors in a cued pattern discrimination task. During stimulus presentation, we recorded event-related potentials and pupillary responses. Motivational relevance increased the amplitudes of the C1 component at approximately 70 ms after stimulus onset. This modulation occurred independently of spatial attention effects, which were evident at the P1 level. Furthermore, motivation and spatial attention had independent effects on preparatory activation as measured by the contingent negative variation; and pupil data showed increased activation in response to incentive targets.

Inpatients reported significantly more side effects (U = 14347, z = 4.70, p < 0.001, r = 0.26) and malpractice and unethical behavior (U = 14168, z = 5.21, p < 0.001, r = 0.29) than outpatients. Rates of severe malpractice in the form of breaking confidentiality and physical and sexual abuse were less than 1% in both settings. Predictors of side effects were prior experience with psychotherapy and current interpersonal difficulties in the outpatient setting and higher motivation for psychotherapy (t (0)) in the inpatient setting. Predictors of malpractice and unethical behavior were younger age in the outpatient setting and poor therapeutic alliance, prior negative experience with malpractice and unethical behavior, and higher outcome expectations in the inpatient setting. NEP are common in both, in- and outpatient settings. Inpatients are at higher risk for the NEP than outpatients.

Differential caloric intake in overweight females with and without binge eating: effects of a laboratory-based emotion-regulation training,"Svaldi, J.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.; Trentowska, M.; Caffier, D.; Naumann, E.","Negative emotions are among the best predictors for the occurrence of binge eating attacks in binge eating disorder (BED). Evidence from self-report and experimental studies suggests that this link may be mediated by deficits in emotion regulation (ER). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to experimentally test the effects of a short laboratory-based ER training on caloric intake in BED. Thirty-nine women with BED and 42 overweight females without BED were randomly assigned to a laboratory-based ER training focusing on either expressive suppression or cognitive reappraisal. They were then given a negative mood induction with the instruction to adopt the learned ER strategy, which was followed by a bogus taste-test. Independent of group membership, caloric intake was significantly higher in the suppression compared to the reappraisal condition. Furthermore, the BED group displayed significantly higher habitual suppression and significantly lower habitual reappraisal scores than the overweight group. The data suggest that therapeutic interventions focusing on the mediation of more adaptive affect-regulation skills may be useful for the reduction of binge eating episodes.",2014,May,Behav Res Ther,56,,39-46,24650627.0,10.1016/j.brat.2014.02.008,,#1249,Svaldi 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Future expectations in clinical depression: Biased or realistic?,"Zetsche, U.; Burkner, P. C.; Renneberg, B.","Negative expectations have been highlighted as a key mechanism in the maintenance and recurrence of depression. Nonetheless, no study has investigated currently depressed individuals' expectations about their future mood so far. This is surprising given that experiences of sustained negative mood and lack of positive mood are the hallmark symptoms of depression. The present study thus assessed depressed individuals' expectations about their future mood and examined whether these expectations are accurate or negatively biased. The study used experience sampling methodology (ESM) to contrast participants' expectations with their actually experienced sad and happy mood within a 4-day period. At the end of this period, participants recalled their past mood. All variables were assessed in 30 clinically depressed individuals and 37 matched healthy controls, as well as in 56 undergraduate students with a wide range in depressive symptoms. Results revealed that clinically depressed individuals held negatively biased expectations about their future mood: they expected more sad and less happy mood than they actually experienced. In contrast, healthy individuals showed realistic expectations about their future mood. Depressed individuals also demonstrated a negative mood recall bias. Finally, individuals' expectations and memories were more closely linked to depression status than their actually experienced mood. Although negative mood is the hallmark symptom of depression, the expectations and memories of negative mood may be even more central for the understanding of depression.

Optimizing the ingredients for imagery-based interpretation bias modification for depressed mood: is self-generation more effective than imagination alone?,"Rohrbacher, H.; Blackwell, S. E.; Holmes, E. A.; Reinecke, A.","Negative interpretation is thought to be crucial in the development and maintenance of depression. Recently developed cognitive bias modification paradigms, intending to change these biases towards a more optimistic interpretation tendency (CBM-I), seem to offer new promising implications for cognitive therapy innovation. This study aimed to increase our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of action of imagery-based CBM-I in the context of depressed mood. We therefore compared the efficacy of CBM-I requiring participants to imagine standardized positive resolutions to a novel, more active training version that required participants to generate the positive interpretations themselves. Fifty-four participants were randomly allocated to (1) standardized CBM-I, (2) self-generation CBM-I or (3) a control group. Outcome measures included self-report mood measures and a depression-related interpretation bias measure. Both positive training variants significantly increased the tendency to interpret fresh ambiguous material in an optimistic manner. However, only the standardized imagery CBM-I paradigm positively influenced mood.",2014,Jan,J Affect Disord,152-154,,212-8,24113076.0,10.1016/j.jad.2013.09.013,,#1251,Rohrbacher 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The effects of prior pain experience on neural correlates of empathy for pain: An fMRI study,"Preis, M. A.; Schmidt-Samoa, C.; Dechent, P.; Kroener-Herwig, B.","Neuroimaging studies have revealed partially shared neural substrates for both the actual experience of pain and empathy elicited by the pain of others. We examined whether prior pain exposure increased neural activity in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) and bilateral anterior insula (AI) as a correlate of empathy for pain. Participants (N=64: 32 women, 32 men) viewed pictures displaying exposure to pressure pain (pain pictures) and pictures without any cue of pain (neutral pictures). Prior to the experiment, half of the participants were exposed to the same pain stimulus as the one seen in the pain pictures (pain exposure condition); the other half had no such experience (touch exposure condition). A balanced sex ratio was kept, to investigate possible sex differences. In the region-of-interest analyses, participants of the pain exposure condition showed decreased activity in the right AI and the aMCC relative to participants of the touch exposure condition. While in men, no differences were found in relation to their exposure condition, women with pain exposure showed decreased activity in the aMCC and additionally, in bilateral AI. Based on the entire sample, whole brain analyses revealed stronger activation in the retrosplenial cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex in the pain exposure condition. In conclusion, prior pain exposure did not increase, but decreased activity in regions regularly associated with empathy for pain. However, pain experience increased activity in regions associated with memory retrieval, perspective taking, and top-down emotion regulation, which might facilitate empathizing with others.",2013,Mar,Pain,154,3,411-418,23318128.0,10.1016/j.pain.2012.11.014,,#1253,Preis 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Nightmare distress is related to traumatic childhood experiences, critical life events and emotional appraisal of a dream rather than to its content","Mathes, J.; Schuffelen, J.; Gieselmann, A.; Pietrowsky, R.","Nightmares are a substantial burden for sleep quality. Previous studies have shown that traumatic experiences can increase the probability of nightmares, and also waking-life distress can enhance this effect. There is evidence that the intensity of negative dream emotions is more responsible for rating a dream as a nightmare than threatening dream contents. However, there is still a lack of research concerning effects on nightmare distress. We hypothesise that traumatic childhood experiences (such as emotional abuse, obtained by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), critical life events (obtained by the Social Readjustment Rating Scale) and threatening dream contents are associated with nightmare distress. A sample of N = 103 participants kept a dream diary over 28 consecutive days. About 60% of the sample were frequent nightmare dreamers. The participants recorded their violent dream contents and dream emotions in their diary. To predict nightmare distress, regression models were constructed; nightmare distress was measured with the Nightmare Distress Questionnaire. Results showed that emotional abuse in childhood and critical life events predicted nightmare distress. Moreover, violent dream contents were associated with nightmare distress but, after we controlled for nightmare frequency and the intensity of negative dream emotions, the significant impact of violent dream contents decreased. The results suggest that the emotional appraisal of a dream has a substantial influence on nightmares in addition to traumatic childhood experiences and critical life events.",2023,Jun,J Sleep Res,32,3,e13779,36333940.0,10.1111/jsr.13779,,#1254,Mathes 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"When a dream turns into a nightmare: Due to negative dream content or to negative appraisal?Gender differences in dream content: Are they related to personality?Threats in dreams: Are they related to waking-life?Clinical judgement heuristics: Methods and models","Mathes, Jonas; Gieselmann, Annika; Pietrowsky, Reinhard; Mathes, Jonas; Schredl, Michael; Mathes, Jonas; Schredl, Michael; Kappesser, J.; de C Williams, A. C.","Nightmares are a well-known phenomenon. The content of aversive dreams seems to be ubiquitous in dreams. Nevertheless, a dream containing aversive contents does not necessarily have to be a nightmare. We hypothesize that nightmares are rather caused by a more negative appraisal of the contents of aversive dreams than by the dream content itself. To investigate this question, N = 99 participants kept dream diaries over 28 consecutive days. An experimental group included persons with frequent nightmares and a control group of persons without nightmares. Violent dream content and emotions during the dream were analyzed by the dreamers themselves and as well as by four external raters. Regarding violent dream content in non-nightmare dream reports, the external raters usually agreed with the dreamers’ ratings. However, there was significant disagreement regarding the nightmare reports. Furthermore, external raters significantly rated the dreams as less positive than the dreamers did, and external raters rated the nightmare reports as more negative than the dreamers themselves did. Taken together, the results support the hypothesis that the classification of a dream as a nightmare does not only depend on its content but also on other factors. This suggests that the dreamers’ ratings of a dream as a nightmare are based on more factors than dream content.Gender differences in dream content have been studied quite extensively. The present study focused on two dream characteristics, the ratio of male and female dream characters and the occurrence of weapons and clothes in dreams. A sample of 1612 diary dreams reported by 425 participants was analyzed using external ratings by a blind judge. Whereas the gender differences regarding the ratio of male and female dream characters was not significant, men reported more weapon dreams but dreams with references to clothing less often, which is in line with previous research. The explorative analyses indicated that some of the big five personality dimensions might be associated with these dream characteristics, e.g., extraverted men’s dreams included more female characters compared to the dreams of introverted men. Research thus far and this study indicate that waking-life (preoccupation with clothes, media showing weapons, waking-life social contacts, etc.) strongly affects these dream characteristics but studies explicitly measuring and correlating waking-life experiences and dream content are still missing.According to the Threat Simulation Theory (TST) dreaming has developed and was maintained during evolution because its function of rehearsing threats is essential for survival. The present study analyzed 1612 diary dreams reported by 425 participants (mainly psychology students). The study results indicate that threats play an important role in dreams and, thus, support the idea that dreaming might have a function of rehearsing problematic or threatening situations. Comparing the present results to previous findings shows a considerably large variability regarding the number of threats per dream, the proportion of minor threats, and the reality of threats. As neuroticism and openness to experience were related to the number of threats per dreams, future research should investigate inter-individual differences in waking life which might help explain the variability regarding the dream threat characteristics.",2020,2013/10/09,International Journal of Dream Research,Vol 13,10,No 2 (October 2020),,"10.11588/IJODR.2020.2.7223110.11588/IJODR.2013.2.1095410.11588/IJODR.2016.1.2749910.1002/j.1532-2149.2013.00392.x",,#1255,Mathes 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Symptom dynamics among nightmare sufferers: An intensive longitudinal study,"Dumser, B.; Werner, G. G.; Ehring, T.; Takano, K.","Nightmares are considerably prevalent in the general population and are known to be closely associated with a variety of mental disorders. However, not much is known about the immediate antecedents and consequences of nightmares. Therefore, we used intensive longitudinal assessments to investigate the night-to-night within-person associations between nightmares on the one hand and fear of sleep, somatic as well as cognitive pre-sleep arousal, and sleep quality on the other hand. Young women with regular nightmares (n = 16) maintained a sleep diary for around 30 days; upon awaking, the participants reported on nightmares and sleep quality during the past night as well as the pre-sleep levels of arousal and fear of sleep (which resulted in 461 observations). Participants also wore an actigraph, which provided objective sleep parameters. Multilevel modeling showed that higher levels of fear of sleep and lower subjective sleep quality were significantly associated with higher levels of nightmare distress. Furthermore, we found individual differences in the strength of these associations, which implies that factors proximate to nightmares may vary across individuals. Pre-sleep arousal, however, did not show expected within-person associations with nightmares or fear of sleep. These findings highlight the crucial role of fear of sleep in the etiology of nightmares and sleep disturbances, while pointing to the importance of pursuing individual, personalised models that explain heterogeneity in the process of triggering nightmares.",2023,Jun,J Sleep Res,32,3,e13776,36351660.0,10.1111/jsr.13776,,#1256,Dumser 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Difficulties in emotion regulation play an important role in the development and maintenance of NSSI. This study investigated the emotion regulation in female adolescents with NSSI according to DSM-5 (n=55), clinical control adolescents with mental disorders without NSSI (n=30), and nonclinical control adolescents (n=58) using self-report questionnaires and interviews. As expected, results indicated that adolescents with NSSI have significantly more difficulties in emotion regulation compared to healthy controls. In addition, adolescents with NSSI reported also significantly more difficulties in impulse control, lack of emotional clarity, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior, and limited access to emotion regulation strategies compared to nonclinical and clinical controls. Adolescents with NSSI felt significantly more often sadness compared to clinical controls (d=0.66) and compared to other emotions. Adolescents with NSSI indicated significantly less often happiness compared to nonclinical controls (d=1.83).

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the proposed diagnostic criteria and the diagnostic and clinical correlates for the validity of a diagnostic entity. The authors investigated the characteristics of NSSI disorder and the proposed diagnostic criteria. A sample of 73 female inpatient adolescents and 37 nonclinical adolescents (aged 13 to 19 years) was recruited. Patients were classified into 4 groups (adolescents with NSSI disorder, adolescents with NSSI without impairment/distress, clinical controls without NSSI, and nonclinical controls). Adolescents were compared on self-reported psychopathology and diagnostic cooccurrences. Results indicate that adolescents with NSSI disorder have a higher level of impairment than adolescents with other mental disorders without NSSI. Most common comorbid diagnoses were major depression, social phobia, and PTSD. There was some overlap of adolescents with NSSI disorder and suicidal behaviour and borderline personality disorder, but there were also important differences. Results further suggest that the proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for NSSI are useful and necessary.

Results revealed significant reductions in symptoms of SAD between pre- and post-assessments, with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.9 to 1.2. Depending on the SAD specific questionnaire applied, 47.8% to 73.5% of the sample showed a reliable positive change, whereas 1.9% to 3.8% showed a reliable negative change. Depressive symptoms and psychological distress also decreased significantly from pre- to post-assessment, with large effect sizes.

Contextual factors determine the use of allocentric information for reaching in a naturalistic scene,"Klinghammer, M.; Blohm, G.; Fiehler, K.","Numerous studies have demonstrated that humans incorporate allocentric information when reaching toward visual targets. So far, it is unclear how this information is integrated into the movement plan when multiple allocentric cues are available. In this study we investigated whether and how the extent of spatial changes and the task relevance of allocentric cues influence reach behavior. To this end, we conducted two experiments where we presented participants three-dimensional-rendered images of a naturalistic breakfast scene on a computer screen. The breakfast scene included multiple objects (allocentric cues) with a subset of objects functioning as potential reach targets (i.e., they were task-relevant). Participants freely viewed the scene and after a short delay, the scene reappeared with one object missing (target) and other objects being shifted left- or rightwards. Afterwards, participants were asked to reach toward the target position on a gray screen while fixating the screen center. We found systematic deviations of reach endpoints in the direction of object shifts which varied with the number of objects shifted, but only if these objects served as potential reach targets. Our results suggest that the integration of allocentric information into the reach plan is determined by contextual factors, in particular by the extent of spatial cue changes and the task-relevance of allocentric cues.",2015,2015/09/29,J Vis,15,13,24,26418592.0,10.1167/15.13.24,,#1261,Klinghammer 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

In BII-fearful participants, phobic stimuli produced larger priming effects and lower response times compared to neutral stimuli, whereas non-anxious control participants showed no such differences. Because these effects are fully present in the fastest responses, they indicate an enhancement in early visuomotor processing of injury pictures in BII-fearful participants. These results are comparable to the enhanced processing of phobic stimuli in other specific phobias (i.e., spider phobia).",2014,Apr,J Anxiety Disord,28,3,291-300,24632074.0,10.1016/j.janxdis.2014.02.001,,#1262,Haberkamp 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

"Pain localization in cluster headache patients: Onset, peak, and radiation","Schroder, P.; Gaul, C.; Drabik, A.; Molsberger, A.","OBJECTIVE AND AIM: To describe differences in pain locations for onset, peak, and radiation aspects of cluster headache (CH) attacks. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data were collected for 23 months using a cross-sectional online survey composed of 117 questions on pain location, demographics, and clinical features. 5260 datapoints on 44 pain locations from 631 respondents were analyzed. RESULTS: During the onset and peak of attacks, pain is concentrated periorbitally. Pain locations outside the periorbital region were reported more frequently for radiation than for onset and peak of attacks. Dorsal (occipital, neck, shoulder) pain was reported more frequently in connection with onset and radiation than during peak: onset (13%) versus peak (6%), p < 0.001, and radiation (22%) versus peak (6%), p < 0.001. There was no significant difference in dorsal pain frequencies for onset (13%) vs. radiation (22%), p = 0.552. Furthermore, the frequency with which individual pain locations were reported differed significantly for onset, peak, and radiation in CH. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the pain location data shows specific frequencies and distributions of pain location for three aspects of CH attacks. The frequency with which individual pain points were reported differed significantly for onset, peak, and radiation. In general, dorsal pain points were reported more frequently for onset and radiation than for peak pain.

However, numerous studies have shown surprisingly stable QOL measures in cancer patients over time. We propose that life goal adjustment can act as the missing link in explaining this response shift. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine associations between life goal adjustment and patients' QOL at baseline and over the course of 20 months. METHODS: Eighty-six cancer patients were recruited during rehabilitation and reassessed at follow-up 20 months later. Life goals were measured using the Life Goals Questionnaire and analyzed in relation to global QOL as assessed with the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire - Short Form. RESULTS: The overall attainment of life goals was associated with QOL. Moreover, over a period of 20 months, perceived QOL and goal attainment remained stable, whereas importance of life goals decreased. Lesser importance and improved goal attainment were predictors of increases in QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that downgrading unattainable goals and making more progress in accomplishing attainable goals may be possible mechanisms of response shift as an adaption to illness. Thus, integrating life goal adjustment into rehabilitation services for cancer patients seems to be worthwhile to enhance an adaptive self-regulation and QOL.",2014,Oct,Psychooncology,23,10,1149-56,24729457.0,10.1002/pon.3538,,#1265,vonBlanckenburg 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Othering refugees: Psychotherapists' attitudes toward patients with and without a refugee background,"Dumke, L.; Neuner, F.","Objective: A large proportion of refugees present with psychological disorders that require psychotherapy as first-line treatment. However, even in countries with well-established psychotherapy system, refugees continue to face barriers to care. Psychotherapists' attitudes toward refugees may also impede access to psychotherapy, as it is evident that stereotypes of health professionals contribute to health care disparities. However, little is known about psychotherapists' attitudes toward refugees. Methods: In a cross-sectional online study of N = 2002 outpatient psychotherapists in Germany (M(age) = 54.48 years, 73.1% female), a vignette experiment was applied to examine differences in therapists' attitudes toward refugee patients from the Middle East and non-refugee patients. Subsequently, associations between attitudes and psychotherapists' characteristics (e.g., provision of treatment for refugees) were analyzed. Results: Results showed significant differences between therapists' attitudes toward refugee and non-refugee patients (etap2 = .23), with more therapy-hindering attitudes toward refugee patients. Higher therapy-hindering attitudes were significantly associated with less frequent provision of psychotherapy for refugees. Conclusion: Our findings provide initial evidence that psychotherapists perceive refugee patients as deviant from the norm and that these divergent attitudes may relate to disparities in mental health care.

While emotional arousal has been identified as a trigger for binge eating in bulimia nervosa (BN), empirical knowledge on the influence of emotions on body image in individuals with BN is scarce. The present study sought to experimentally examine effects of a positive and negative emotion induction on body dissatisfaction and selective attention towards negatively valenced body parts among people with BN. METHOD: In a randomized-controlled cross-over design, happiness and sadness were induced by film clips one-week apart in women with BN (n = 23) and non-ED controls (n = 26). After the emotion induction, participants looked at their body in a full-length mirror, while their attentional allocation was recorded with the help of a mobile eye tracker. Participants repeatedly rated their momentary body dissatisfaction. RESULTS: Induction of happiness led to a significant decrease in self-reported body dissatisfaction. Furthermore, attentional bias (higher gaze duration and frequency) towards the most disliked body part relative to the most liked body part was significantly greater in the sadness than happiness condition in BN. No significant effects of emotion induction on gaze duration and gaze frequency during mirror exposure were found for controls.

RESULTS: When expecting a Wi-Fi signal to be present, participants showed a significantly more liberal response bias c (p = .010, etap2 = 0.08) for tactile stimuli in the SSDT as evidence of a higher propensity to experience somatosensory illusions. No significant alteration of somatosensory sensitivity d' (p = .76, etap2 < 0.002) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Negative expectations about the harmfulness of electromagnetic fields may foster the occurrence of illusory symptom perceptions via alterations in the somatosensory decision criterion. The findings are in line with central tenets of the predictive processing account of somatic symptom generation. This account proposes a decoupling of percept and somatosensory input so that perception becomes increasingly dependent on predictions. This biased perception is regarded as a risk factor for somatic symptom disorders.",2021,Jan 1,Psychosom Med,83,1,94-100,33141791.0,10.1097/PSY.0000000000000884,,#1269,Wolters 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Relevance of therapy goals in outpatient cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic psychotherapy,"Schottke, H.; Trame, L.; Sembill, A.","OBJECTIVE: Against a background of sparse research and contradictory findings, the present study investigates determinants of psychotherapy goals and predictive value for therapy success in outpatient psychotherapy. METHOD: The sample consisted of 473 patients from a university-based polyclinic and their corresponding 103 therapists. Goals were coded with the Bern Inventory of Treatment Goals (BIT-T). RESULTS: The results show that goal congruence between therapists and patients is relatively small. Theoretical orientation had a significant influence on the complexity of goal structure and goal preferences. With regard to the prognostic validity, only patients' problem- and symptom-focused goals enabled the prediction of treatment success independent of basic therapeutic variables. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underline the importance of consideration of patients' individual treatment goals in clinical practice and underpin the relevance of therapy goals for future psychotherapy research.",2014,2014/02/07,Psychother Res,24,6,711-23,24506587.0,10.1080/10503307.2014.881578,,#1271,Schottke 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

METHODS: Reliability, convergent as well as criterion validity were assessed in a sample of 128 patients in a hospital-setting. RESULTS: The APC showed high to very high reliability for the two main scales and for most of its subscales, convergent validity, and was related to depression and attachment insecurity. The scale for the assessment of protective childhood experiences explained incremental variance regarding validity.

Relapse prevention in abstinent alcoholics by cognitive bias modification: Clinical effects of combining approach bias modification and attention bias modification,"Rinck, M.; Wiers, R. W.; Becker, E. S.; Lindenmeyer, J.","OBJECTIVE: Alcohol-dependent patients show attentional and approach biases for alcohol-related stimuli. Computerized cognitive bias modification (CBM) programs aim to retrain these biases and reduce relapse rates as add-ons to treatment. Retraining of alcohol-approach tendencies has already yielded significant reductions of relapse rates in previous studies, and retraining of biased attention toward alcohol is promising approach. The current large-scale randomized controlled trial compared the clinical effects of these training methods-separately and in combination-to those of sham training methods and a no-training control, as an add-on to regular treatment. METHODS: Participants were 1,405 alcohol-dependent patients of an inpatient rehabilitation clinic. In addition to regular treatment, patients were randomized to receive 6 sessions of approach-bias retraining, 6 sessions of attention-bias retraining, 3 sessions of each of these CBM training varieties, 6 sessions of variants of sham training, or no training. Effects of the training methods were evaluated by measuring treatment success at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Primary outcome: The 3 active training conditions yielded higher success rates at 1-year follow-up than sham training or no training (8.4%, on average). Secondary results (available for half of the sample): Both varieties of CBM had only small effects on the targeted biases (significant only for the combined training). Moreover, neither significant mediation of the clinical effect by the change in trained bias nor significant moderation of the clinical effect was found. CONCLUSIONS: Both alcohol-avoidance training and alcohol-attention training increased success rates effectively, as did the combination of both methods. Future studies should test ways to increase training effectiveness further.

Altered Interoceptive Awareness in High Habitual Symptom Reporters and Patients With Somatoform Disorders,"Flasinski, T.; Dierolf, A. M.; Rost, S.; Lutz, A. P. C.; Voderholzer, U.; Koch, S.; Bach, M.; Asenstorfer, C.; Munch, E. E.; Mertens, V. C.; Vogele, C.; Schulz, A.","Objective: Altered interoception may play a major role in the etiology of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). It remains unclear, however, if these alterations concern noticing of signals or if they are limited to the interpretation of signals. We investigated whether individuals with MUS differ in interoceptive awareness as assessed with the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) questionnaire. Methods: Study 1: A total of 486 individuals completed the Screening for Somatoform Disorders (SOMS-2). Thirty-two individuals each of the upper and lower decile of the SOMS distribution (low symptom reporters/LSR, high symptom reporters/HSR) completed the MAIA. Study 2: MAIA scores of individuals diagnosed with somatoform disorder (SFD; n = 26) were compared to individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 25) and healthy controls (HC; n = 26). Results: HSR had lower scores than LSR on the MAIA scales Not-Distracting and Not-Worrying. The SFD and MDD groups showed lower scores than HC on the MAIA scales Not-Distracting, Self-Regulation, and Trusting. The MDD group scored lower than the other two groups on the scales Body Listening and Attention Regulation. There were no group differences on the scale Noticing. Conclusion: HSR, SFD, and MDD patients do not differ from HC in the awareness of noticing of interoceptive signal processing, whereas cognitive facets of interoception, such as distraction or self-regulation are differentially affected. This highlights the necessity of including specifically targeted interventions, which improve interoceptive awareness, in the prevention and treatment of SFDs.",2020,2020/08/07,Front Psychol,11,,1859,32849092.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01859,,#1274,Flasinski 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Efficacy and Feasibility of a Therapist-Guided Internet-Based Intervention for Older Persons with Childhood Traumatization: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Knaevelsrud, C.; Bottche, M.; Pietrzak, R. H.; Freyberger, H. J.; Kuwert, P.","OBJECTIVE: Although cognitive-behavioral treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exist, only a small proportion of older adults seeks psychological treatment. Alternative treatment approaches are thus needed to fill the gap between provision and use of psychological interventions. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of an Internet-based, therapist-guided cognitive-behavioral therapy (Internet-based CBT) for older individuals with PTSD symptoms. METHODS: Patients with clinically meaningful (i.e., subsyndromal or greater) PTSD symptoms were randomly assigned to a 6-week treatment group of therapist-guided Internet-based CBT (N = 47; treatment group) or a wait-list group (N = 47; WL). The treatment group was assessed pre- and post-treatment as well as at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects analyses showed a significant interaction between group (treatment versus WL) and time (pre versus post) for PTSD symptoms with a moderate between-group effect size in favor of the treatment group (d = 0.42). Effects in the treatment group were maintained up to the 12-month follow-up. Findings indicate a significant interaction (group x time) for quality of life (d = 0.39) and self-efficacy (d = 0.38). With regard to the feasibility, attrition rate was very low in both groups (treatment group: 12.8%, WL: 6.4%) and working alliance was very high. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that therapist-guided Internet-based CBT is associated with a substantial reduction in PTSD symptoms, and increase in resource-related variables in older adults with (subsyndromal) PTSD. This Internet-based intervention may offer a promising option in a stepped-care approach for older trauma-affected persons who may otherwise not pursue mental health treatment.",2017,Aug,Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,25,8,878-888,28365000.0,10.1016/j.jagp.2017.02.024,,#1275,Knaevelsrud 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Predictors of the application of exposure in vivo in the treatment of agoraphobia in an outpatient clinic: An exploratory approach,"Klan, T.; Jasper, F.; Hiller, W.","OBJECTIVE: Although exposure in vivo is considered to be the most effective therapy component in the treatment of agoraphobia (AG), there is a remarkable lack of its application in psychotherapeutic routine care. We examined the severity of anxiety, psychological distress/comorbidity, therapeutic process/alliance, and sociodemographic status as potential predictors of in vivo exposure. METHOD: We applied correlational analyses and logistic regression analyses in a sample of N = 92 patients (main diagnosis AG) in an outpatient setting. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses did not yield any significant single predictors, whereas a combination of a subset of predictors significantly predicted the application of exposure in vivo in the completer sample (R(2) = .24, p = .041).

"Eating disorder psychopathology: The role of attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and personality functioning","Klein, E. M.; Benecke, C.; Kasinger, C.; Brahler, E.; Ehrenthal, J. C.; Strauss, B.; Ernst, M.","OBJECTIVE: Although the relationship between insecure attachment patterns and eating disorder (ED) psychopathology has repeatedly been demonstrated, the underlying mechanisms of this association are not fully understood. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine personality functioning, defined as an impairment in self and interpersonal functioning, as a mediator between attachment insecurity and ED psychopathology. METHODS: In a representative population-based sample (N = 2508; age range 14-92 years) ED symptomatology, personality functioning, and attachment insecurity (anxiety and avoidance) were assessed. Besides descriptive uni-/bivariate analysis, path analysis was used to test a mediation model while controlling for the effects of age, gender, mental distress, and BMI. RESULTS: ED symptomatology was associated with lower levels of personality functioning (r = 0.22) and higher levels of attachment anxiety (r = 0.14) but did not correlate with attachment avoidance (r = 0.02). Path analysis revealed that personality functioning fully mediated the effect of attachment anxiety on ED symptomatology: The indirect effect via personality functioning (beta = 0.04, p < .001) accounted for 77% of the total effect. Fit indices were excellent. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the main results were mainly applicable to women and the middle age group. CONCLUSION: The present findings contribute to the growing body of research using dimensional conceptualizations of personality functioning, suggesting that it provides an informative, overarching framework for understanding and treating ED psychopathology. Findings indicate that underlying individual differences, e.g., with respect to insecure attachment configurations, have relevant implications for symptom manifestations.

Internet-based interpretation bias modification for body dissatisfaction: A three-armed randomized controlled trial,"Dietel, F. A.; Zache, C.; Burkner, P. C.; Schulte, J.; Mobius, M.; Bischof, A.; Wilhelm, S.; Buhlmann, U.","OBJECTIVE: Appearance-related interpretation bias is postulated to play a role in the maintenance of body dissatisfaction (BD), a risk factor for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), and eating disorders (ED). Cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) has been shown to reduce maladaptive interpretation bias and symptoms in various emotional disorders. This study investigated the acceptability and efficacy of an easily disseminable, web-based CBM-I program for BD. METHODS: Individuals with high BD (N = 318) were randomized to a multi-session CBM-I (Sentence Word Association Paradigm [SWAP] with feedback) vs. control (SWAP without feedback) versus waitlist condition. Interpretation bias, BD and associated symptoms were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Symptoms were monitored up to 1-week and 4-week follow-up. We further investigated transference effects to stress reactivity, as predicted by cognitive-behavioral models, at post-intervention. RESULTS: Appearance-related CBM-I led to a differential pre-post increase in adaptive interpretation patterns, particularly for appearance-related and social situations (d = 0.65-1.18). Both CBM-I and control training reduced BD, BDD symptom severity, and depression. However, CBM-I (vs. control and waitlist) improved appearance-related quality of life (d = 0.51), self-esteem (d = 0.52), and maladaptive appearance-related beliefs (d = 0.47). State stress reactivity was overall reduced in the CBM-I condition (vs. waitlist). Intervention effects largely held stable up to follow-ups. Treatment satisfaction was comparable to other CBM-I studies, with low rates of adverse reactions. DISCUSSION: These findings support assumptions of cognitive-behavioral models for BD, BDD, and ED, and suggest that web-based CBM-I is an efficacious and acceptable intervention option.",2020,Jun,Int J Eat Disord,53,6,972-986,32432384.0,10.1002/eat.23280,,#1278,Dietel 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
An app-based blended intervention to reduce body dissatisfaction: A randomized controlled pilot study,"Kollei, I.; Lukas, C. A.; Loeber, S.; Berking, M.","OBJECTIVE: As a common experience in the general population, dissatisfaction with one's body is associated with a variety of psychological problems and unhealthy behaviors, including the development of eating disorders. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to develop and evaluate an app-based intervention to reduce body dissatisfaction. METHOD: Participants reporting elevated levels of body dissatisfaction were randomly allocated to an app-based intervention (n = 26) or to a wait list group (n = 27). The app-based intervention included a brief counseling session and 14 days of training with the Mindtastic Body Dissatisfaction app (MT-BD). The MT-BD app uses gamification strategies to systematically foster approach of functional and avoidance of dysfunctional stimuli. The primary outcome was body dissatisfaction as assessed with the Body Dissatisfaction scale of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (Garner, 1991). Secondary outcome measures included severity of eating disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in body dissatisfaction compared to the wait list group (d = -0.62). The intervention group also showed greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms compared to the wait list group (d = -0.46). Reductions in body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms were sustained at a 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: We found preliminary evidence that an app-based intervention may significantly reduce body dissatisfaction. Further research using larger samples and targeting clinical populations is necessary to evaluate the potential of interventions such as MT-BD.

Relations between criteria for somatic symptom disorder and quality of life in asylum seekers living in Germany,"Giesebrecht, J.; Grupp, F.; Reich, H.; Weise, C.; Mewes, R.","OBJECTIVE: Asylum seekers often suffer from medically unexplained symptoms that affect their quality of life (QoL). The present study is the first to investigate the extent to which somatic symptoms and the B criteria for the DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder (SSD) are associated with the QoL of asylum seekers living in Germany. METHODS: In 144 asylum seekers, somatic symptoms (PHQ-15), B criteria for SSD, symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PDS), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), post-migration living difficulties (PMLD), and QoL (EUROHIS) were assessed cross-sectionally. Multiple regressions in the total sample and in groups of somatic symptom severity (mild/moderate and severe) were conducted to examine the associations between somatic symptoms and B criteria with QoL. RESULTS: Sleep problems and pain were the most frequently reported somatic symptoms. Sixteen (11%) participants met one B criterion, 24 (17%) met two, and 84 (58%) met all three criteria. QoL correlated negatively with somatic symptoms (r = -0.56, p < .001) and with the existence of at least one B criterion (r = -0.24, p < .001). In the total sample, stronger depressive and somatic symptoms were related to lower QoL (adjusted R(2) = 0.53) while the B criteria were not. In persons with severe somatic symptom severity, the B criterion behavior was associated with lower QoL.

"Same, same but different: Attention bias for food cues in adults and adolescents with anorexia nervosa","Werthmann, J.; Simic, M.; Konstantellou, A.; Mansfield, P.; Mercado, D.; van Ens, W.; Schmidt, U.","OBJECTIVE: Attention processing for food may be biased in people with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). However, previous studies have had inconsistent results. This is likely to be due to indirect assessment of attention, which does not inform on the underlying attention processes, and/or the heterogeneity of participants across studies, testing either adults or adolescents with AN, that is, people at very different developmental and illness stages. METHOD: Eye-tracking was employed as a direct assessment of attention during a visual probe task with food versus non-food pictures. Attention bias for food was measured in 39 adults and 34 adolescents with AN and in 53 adults and 31 adolescents without AN. RESULTS: All participants had a direction bias for food, specifically for high-calorie food. However, adults with AN subsequently avoided maintaining attention on food versus non-food cues, compared to adults without AN. Adolescents with or without AN demonstrated increased attention maintenance on food versus non-food cues, and, contrary to our hypothesis, did not differ in their attention bias for food cues. Accordingly, adults with AN differed significantly from adolescents with AN in attention maintenance for food cues: while adolescents with AN showed significantly increased attention maintenance on food stimuli, adults avoided maintaining attention on food cues. DISCUSSION: Adults with AN may apply attention strategies to facilitate restrictive eating. This strategy is absent in adolescents with AN. This difference in food-related attention bias between adolescents and adults with AN suggests that attention biases develop over time as the illness progresses.",2019,Jun,Int J Eat Disord,52,6,681-690,30912189.0,10.1002/eat.23064,,#1281,Werthmann 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"German Validation of the Conners 3(R) Rating Scales for Parents, Teachers, and Children","Christiansen, H.; Hirsch, O.; Drechsler, R.; Wanderer, S.; Knospe, E. L.; Gunther, T.; Lidzba, K.","OBJECTIVE: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) rating scales such as the Conners' Rating Scales (CRS) are valuable adjuncts for diagnosis, since they offer parent, teacher, and self-ratings of children susceptible for ADHD. Even though the scales are widely used internationally, cross-cultural comparability has rarely been verified, and culture and language invariance have only been presumed. The Conners 3((R)) rating scales are the updated version of the CRS, though hardly any studies report the psychometric properties apart from the results published in the test edition itself. To our knowledge there are no studies on the various adaptations of the Conners 3((R)) in other languages. METHOD: The German translations of the Conners 3((R)) were completed by 745 children, 953 parents, and 741 teachers (children's age range: 6-18 years, mean: 11.74 years of age). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on content scale items were conducted to obtain the factor structure for the German version and to replicate the factor structure of the original American models. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to establish internal consistency. RESULTS: The exploratory analyses for the German model resulted in factor structures globally different from the American model, though confirmatory analyses revealed very good model fi ts with highly satisfying Cronbach's alphas. We were able to provide empirical evidence for the subscale Inattention which had only hypothetically been derived by Conners (2008).

Movement-based patient-therapist attunement in psychological therapy and its association with early change,"Schwartz, B.; Rubel, J. A.; Deisenhofer, A. K.; Lutz, W.","OBJECTIVE: Attunement is a novel measure of nonverbal synchrony reflecting the duration of the present moment shared by two interaction partners. This study examined its association with early change in outpatient psychotherapy. METHODS: Automated video analysis based on motion energy analysis (MEA) and cross-correlation of the movement time-series of patient and therapist was conducted to calculate movement synchrony for N = 161 outpatients. Movement-based attunement was defined as the range of connected time lags with significant synchrony. Latent change classes in the HSCL-11 were identified with growth mixture modeling (GMM) and predicted by pre-treatment covariates and attunement using multilevel multinomial regression. RESULTS: GMM identified four latent classes: high impairment, no change (Class 1); high impairment, early response (Class 2); moderate impairment (Class 3); and low impairment (Class 4). Class 2 showed the strongest attunement, the largest early response, and the best outcome. Stronger attunement was associated with a higher likelihood of membership in Class 2 (b = 0.313, p = .007), Class 3 (b = 0.251, p = .033), and Class 4 (b = 0.275, p = .043) compared to Class 1. For highly impaired patients, the probability of no early change (Class 1) decreased and the probability of early response (Class 2) increased as a function of attunement. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with high impairment, stronger patient-therapist attunement was associated with early response, which predicted a better treatment outcome.

The effects of pre-intervention mindset induction on a brief intervention to increase risk perception and reduce alcohol use among university students: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Buchele, N.; Keller, L.; Zeller, A. C.; Schrietter, F.; Treiber, J.; Gollwitzer, P. M.; Odenwald, M.","OBJECTIVE: Brief interventions based on personalized feedback have shown promising results in reducing risky alcohol use among university students. We investigated the effects of activating deliberative (predecisional) or implemental (postdecisional) mindsets on the effectiveness of a standardized brief intervention, the ASSIST-linked Brief Intervention. This intervention comprises a personalized feedback and a decisional balance exercise. We hypothesized that participants in a deliberative mindset should show better outcomes related to risk perception and behavior than participants in an implemental mindset. METHODS: A sample of 257 students provided baseline measures on risk perception, readiness to change, and alcohol use. Of those, 64 students with risky alcohol use were randomly allocated to one of two mindset induction conditions-deliberative or implemental mindset. Thereafter, they received the ASSIST-linked Brief Intervention and completed self-report questionnaires on changes in risk perception, alcohol use, and readiness to change at post-intervention and four-week follow-up. RESULTS: In contrast to our hypotheses, the four-weeks follow-up revealed that participants in the implemental mindset consumed significantly less alcohol than participants in a deliberative mindset did. The former decreased and the latter increased their alcohol intake; resistance to the brief intervention was stronger in the latter condition. However, neither deliberative nor implemental mindset participants showed any changes in risk perceptions or in their readiness to change alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that mindset induction is a powerful moderator of the effects of the ASSIST-linked Brief Intervention.

Social cognition in anorexia nervosa: Specific difficulties in decoding emotional but not nonemotional mental states,"Brockmeyer, T.; Pellegrino, J.; Munch, H.; Herzog, W.; Dziobek, I.; Friederich, H. C.","OBJECTIVE: Building on recent models of anorexia nervosa (AN) that emphasize the importance of impaired social cognition in the development and maintenance of the disorder, the present study aimed at examining whether women with AN have more difficulties with inferring other people's emotional and nonemotional mental states than healthy women. METHOD: Social cognition was assessed in 25 adult women with AN and 25 age-matched healthy women. To overcome limitations of previous research on social cognition in AN, the processing of social information was examined in a more complex and ecologically valid manner. The Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) reflects complex real-life social interaction and allows for disentangling emotional and non-emotional mental state inference as well as different types of errors in mentalizing. RESULTS: Women with AN showed poorer emotional mental state inference, whereas non-emotional mental state inference was largely intact. Groups did not differ in undermentalizing (overly simplistic theory of mind) and overmentalizing (overly complex or over-interpretative mental state reasoning). Performance in the MASC was independent of levels of eating disorder psychopathology and symptoms of depression and anxiety. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that AN is associated with specific difficulties in emotional mental state inference despite largely intact nonemotional mental state inference.

The real ABM condition adopted an implicit learning paradigm in which participants were trained to show avoidance behavior in response to food cues. Participants in the sham condition used a similar task but were not trained to avoid food cues. Both conditions comprised 10 training sessions within 4 weeks. RESULTS: Participants in both groups experienced significant reductions in binge eating, eating disorder symptoms, trait food craving, and food cue reactivity. Real ABM tended to result in greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms than sham ABM. Food intake, approach bias, and attention bias toward food did not change. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT on ABM in eating disorders. The findings provide limited support for the efficacy of ABM in BN/BED and pose questions regarding its active ingredients and its usefulness as a stand-alone treatment for eating disorders.",2019,May,Int J Eat Disord,52,5,520-529,30689229.0,10.1002/eat.23024,,#1287,Brockmeyer 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"The association between psychopathology, childhood trauma, and emotion processing","Flechsenhar, A.; Seitz, K. I.; Bertsch, K.; Herpertz, S. C.","OBJECTIVE: Childhood trauma is highly prevalent and can have a negative impact on the development of socioemotional processes resulting in a higher vulnerability for mental disorders in adulthood. Previous studies have associated the severity of childhood trauma with deficits in social functioning, such as a negative attention bias, suggesting altered social information processing as a mechanism underlying the association between childhood trauma and transdiagnostic psychopathologies. METHOD: In a cross-sectional setup with a total of 103 participants (26 with major depressive disorder, MDD; 24 with posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD; 22 with somatic symptom disorder, SDD; and 31 healthy volunteers, HV), this study applied eye tracking in an emotion recognition paradigm. Reaction times, accuracy, and gaze behavior were analyzed for 4 different facial expressions as a function of self-reported childhood trauma and diagnosis. The aim was to investigate to what extent emotion processing is associated with (a) childhood trauma, (b) psychopathology, and (c) respective interacting effects. RESULTS: Patients showed higher reaction times and error rates overall in classifying emotions than HVs, especially for the recognition of anger and fear. Individuals with a diagnosis of PTSD and MDD were particularly slow in their response to these emotions. Higher scores of reported childhood trauma were associated with faster responses for classifying anger and fear and slower initiation of eye movements for SSD, MDD, and HVs for anger. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that childhood trauma may contribute to attentional and information-processing biases relevant for social interaction. Identifying individual social deficits offers implications for tailored therapeutic interventions.

"Visual selective attention in body dysmorphic disorder, bulimia nervosa and healthy controls","Kollei, I.; Horndasch, S.; Erim, Y.; Martin, A.","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive behavioral models postulate that selective attention plays an important role in the maintenance of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). It is suggested that individuals with BDD overfocus on perceived defects in their appearance, which may contribute to the excessive preoccupation with their appearance. METHODS: The present study used eye tracking to examine visual selective attention in individuals with BDD (n=19), as compared to individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) (n=21) and healthy controls (HCs) (n=21). Participants completed interviews, questionnaires, rating scales and an eye tracking task: Eye movements were recorded while participants viewed photographs of their own face and attractive as well as unattractive other faces. RESULTS: Eye tracking data showed that BDD and BN participants focused less on their self-rated most attractive facial part than HCs. Scanning patterns in own and other faces showed that BDD and BN participants paid as much attention to attractive as to unattractive features in their own face, whereas they focused more on attractive features in attractive other faces. HCs paid more attention to attractive features in their own face and did the same in attractive other faces. CONCLUSION: Results indicate an attentional bias in BDD and BN participants manifesting itself in a neglect of positive features compared to HCs. Perceptual retraining may be an important aspect to focus on in therapy in order to overcome the neglect of positive facial aspects. Future research should aim to disentangle attentional processes in BDD by examining the time course of attentional processing.",2017,Jan,J Psychosom Res,92,,26-33,27998509.0,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2016.11.008,,#1291,Kollei 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Mechanisms of Change in Trauma-Focused Treatment for PTSD: The Role of Rumination,"Schumm, H.; Kruger-Gottschalk, A.; Dyer, A.; Pittig, A.; Cludius, B.; Takano, K.; Alpers, G. W.; Ehring, T.","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been well established in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In recent years, researchers have begun to investigate its underlying mechanisms of change. Dysfunctional cognitive content, i.e. excessively negative appraisals of the trauma or its consequences, has been shown to predict changes in PTSD symptoms over the course of treatment. However, the role of change in cognitive processes, such as trauma-related rumination, needs to be addressed. The present study investigates whether changes in rumination intensity precede and predict changes in symptom severity. We also explored the extent to which symptom severity predicts rumination. METHOD: As part of a naturalistic effectiveness study evaluating CBT for PTSD in routine clinical care, eighty-eight patients with PTSD completed weekly measures of rumination and symptom severity. Lagged associations between rumination and symptoms in the following week were examined using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Over the course of therapy, both ruminative thinking and PTSD symptoms decreased. Rumination was a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms in the following week, although this effect was at least partly explained by the time factor (e.g., natural recovery or inseparable treatment effects). Symptom severity predicted ruminative thinking in the following week even with time as an additional predictor. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides preliminary evidence that rumination in PTSD is reduced by CBT for PTSD but does not give conclusive evidence that rumination is a mechanism of change in trauma-focused treatment for PTSD.",2022,Jan,Behav Res Ther,148,,104009,34823161.0,10.1016/j.brat.2021.104009,,#1292,Schumm 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Selective Visual Attention during Mirror Exposure in Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa,"Tuschen-Caffier, B.; Bender, C.; Caffier, D.; Klenner, K.; Braks, K.; Svaldi, J.","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive theories suggest that body dissatisfaction results from the activation of maladaptive appearance schemata, which guide mental processes such as selective attention to shape and weight-related information. In line with this, the present study hypothesized that patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are characterized by increased visual attention for the most dissatisfying/ugly body part compared to their most satisfying/beautiful body part, while a more balanced viewing pattern was expected for controls without eating disorders (CG). METHOD: Eye movements were recorded in a group of patients with AN (n = 16), BN (n = 16) and a CG (n = 16) in an ecologically valid setting, i.e., during a 3-min mirror exposure. RESULTS: Evidence was found that patients with AN and BN display longer and more frequent gazes towards the most dissatisfying relative to the most satisfying and towards their most ugly compared to their most beautiful body parts, whereas the CG showed a more balanced gaze pattern. DISCUSSION: The results converge with theoretical models that emphasize the role of information processing in the maintenance of body dissatisfaction.

Cognitive therapy and exposure therapy for hypochondriasis (health anxiety): A 3-year naturalistic follow-up,"Weck, F.; Nagel, L. C.; Hofling, V.; Neng, J. M. B.","OBJECTIVE: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in treating hypochondriasis. However, there are doubts regarding the long-term effectiveness of CBT for hypochondriasis, in particular for follow-up periods longer than 1 year. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of cognitive therapy (CT) and exposure therapy (ET) for the treatment of hypochondriasis. METHOD: Seventy-five patients with a diagnosis of hypochondriasis who were previously treated with CT or ET were contacted 3 years after treatment. Fifty (67%) patients participated and were interviewed by an independent and blinded diagnostician using standardized interviews. RESULTS: We found further improvements after therapy in primary outcome measures (d = .37), general functioning (d = .38), and reduced doctor visits (d = .30) during the naturalistic follow-up period. At the 3-year follow-up, 72% of the patients no longer fulfilled the diagnosis of hypochondriasis. Based on the main outcome measure, we found response rates of 76% and remission rates of 68%. At follow-up, only 4% of patients were taking antidepressant medication. Additional psychological treatment was utilized by 18% of the patients during the follow-up period (only 8% because of health anxiety). We found no overall differences between CT and ET. Only a trend for a greater deterioration rate in CT (13%) in comparison to ET (0%) was found. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that (2/3) of the patients with hypochondriasis were remitted in the long term. Thus, remission rates after CBT were twice as high as in untreated samples.

However, little is known about which therapeutic interventions are most promising. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of cognitive therapy (CT) with exposure therapy (ET). METHOD: Eighty-four patients with a diagnosis of hypochondriasis were randomly allocated to CT, ET, or a waiting list (WL) control group. The primary outcome measure was a standardized interview that evaluated hypochondriacal cognitions as well as behaviors conducted by independent diagnosticians. Several self-report questionnaires were evaluated as secondary outcome measures. Treatment success was evaluated at posttreatment and at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Both CT (Hedges's g = 1.01-1.11) and ET (Hedges's g = 1.21-1.24) demonstrated their efficacy in comparison with the WL in the primary outcome measure. Moreover, a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and bodily complaints was found in the secondary outcome measures for both treatments in comparison with the WL, but anxiety symptoms were only significantly reduced by ET. In a direct comparison, no significant differences were found between CT and ET in the primary or the secondary outcome measures. Regarding safety behaviors, we found a significantly larger improvement with ET than with CT in the completer analyses.

Cognitive control functions in individuals with obesity with and without binge-eating disorder,"Kollei, I.; Rustemeier, M.; Schroeder, S.; Jongen, S.; Herpertz, S.; Loeber, S.","OBJECTIVE: Deficits in cognitive control are thought to contribute to the maintenance of obesity (OB). Cognitive control is referred to as impulsivity and binge-eating disorder (BED) is characterized by high levels of impulsivity. The present study sought to elucidate which cognitive control functions differentiate between severe OB with and without BED also taking into account hunger as a moderating factor. METHOD: The study included 48 individuals with OB and BED (OB + BED), 48 individuals with OB and no BED (OB - BED) and 48 normal-weight controls (NWC). Hunger was systematically manipulated: participants were instructed to refrain from eating before testing and received either a liquid meal or flavored water. Then, a comprehensive test battery was administered including a food-related go/no-go task and several subtests from the CANTAB. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups with regard to food-related response inhibition. However, while manipulating hunger had no impact on performance in the go/no-go task, self-reported hunger significantly influenced task performance by increasing inhibition deficits to high-caloric stimuli in OB + BED. With regard to general cognitive control functions, we found that deficits in attention and impulse control in decision-making distinguished OB from NWC, while reversal learning and risk taking in decision-making appeared to be relevant factors when distinguishing OB + BED from OB - BED. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that self-reported hunger differentially affected food-related response inhibition. Group differences in general cognitive control functions were limited to attention, reversal learning, and decision-making.

RESULTS: Consistent across the two studies, participants in the clinical samples reported lower general and lower specific ER skills than participants in the general population sample. Also consistent across the two studies, diagnostic subgroups of the clinical samples differed significantly with regard to general and specific ER skills.

Impaired Behavioral Inhibition in Implicit Sequence Learning in Adult ADHD,"Pedersen, A.; Ohrmann, P.","OBJECTIVE: Deficits in explicit learning and memory have consistently been reported in adult ADHD, but it is less clear whether these deficits reflect deficient attentional processes or specific dysfunctions in memory processes. Studies on implicit learning and memory, which are less dependent on the allocation of attention, have rarely been conducted on adult ADHD. METHOD: We implemented a modified serial reaction-time task that involves distracting stimuli to investigate implicit sequence learning in 32 adult participants with ADHD and in 32 matched healthy control participants. RESULTS: The participants with ADHD revealed unimpaired implicit learning performance, but they made significantly more errors than the control participants. There was no evidence for impaired error monitoring in the participants with ADHD reflected by a comparable degree of double errors and post-error slowing in the two groups.

In the context of limited time and resources, session-by-session evaluation is rare in most clinical settings. This study aimed to validate innovative prediction methods for individual treatment progress and dropout risk based on basic outcome monitoring. METHODS: Routine data of a naturalistic psychotherapy outpatient sample were analyzed (N = 3902). Patients were treated with cognitive behavioral therapy with up to 95 sessions (M = 39.19, SD = 16.99) and assessment intervals of 5-15 sessions. Treatment progress and dropout risk were predicted in two independent analyses using the nearest neighbor method and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, respectively. RESULTS: The correlation between observed and predicted patient progress was r = .46. Intrinsic treatment motivation, previous inpatient treatment, university-entrance qualification, baseline impairment, diagnosed personality disorder, and diagnosed eating disorder were identified as significant predictors of dropout, explaining 11% of variance.

Modeling in psychotherapy training: A randomized controlled proof-of-concept trial,"Kuhne, F.; Heinze, P. E.; Maass, U.; Weck, F.","OBJECTIVE: Despite the importance of modeling for learning, it has only so far been investigated in a few controlled studies in psychotherapy training. We, therefore, investigated, across several study outcomes, whether modeling outperformed a control group. METHOD: Sixty-nine trainees (i.e., psychology students; mean age 25.58 years, 81.2% women and 81.2% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG, manual reading plus modeling) or control group (CG, manual reading). After manual reading, IG participants watched a video of a skillfully conducted therapy session, whereas CG participants watched an unspecific tutorial (e.g., solving a Rubik's Cube). Trainees then demonstrated cognitive behavioral interventions in videotaped role-plays with (SPs). Psychotherapeutic competences and counseling skills were rated by two independent raters, on the Cognitive Therapy Scale (CTS) and the Clinical Communication Skills Scale-Short Form (CCSS-S). In addition, raters, trainees, and SPs assessed empathy (Empathy Scale [ES]) and alliance (Helping Alliance Questionnaire [HAQ]). RESULTS: Multilevel modeling revealed Significant Time x Group Effects, that is, psychotherapy competences (CTS, beta = .26, p = .026) and counseling skills (CCSS-S, beta = .31, p = .004) to increase more pre-post in the IG than in the CG (rater perspective). The same applied to the alliance (HAQ) from the external rater and SP perspectives. Trainees evaluated the alliance as improving in both groups from pre to post training (main effect).

"Emotional Reactivity, Emotion Regulation, and Regulatory Choice in Somatic Symptom Disorder","Schnabel, K.; Schulz, S. M.; Witthoft, M.","OBJECTIVE: Despite the transdiagnostic importance of emotional dysregulation in psychopathology, the exact nature of emotional dysregulation in somatic symptom disorders (SSDs) is still unclear. The present study compared measures of emotional reactivity, emotion regulation (ER), and regulatory choice between n = 62 individuals with SSD ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ) and n = 61 healthy participants. METHODS: Participants underwent two ER tasks, assessing a) efficacy of reappraisal and suppression, and 2) regulatory choice, while electrodermal activity and heart rate variability were recorded. In addition, self-reports (Emotion Reactivity Scale, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale) regarding habitual emotional reactions and regulation strategies were assessed. RESULTS: Individuals with SSD reported significantly higher trait emotional reactivity (Emotion Reactivity Scale; p < .001, d = 1.61), significantly more trait ER difficulties (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; p < .001, d = 1.62), and significantly lower reappraisal use in daily life (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; p < .001, d = -0.75). On a behavioral and physiological levels, no significant group differences were found regarding emotional reactivity (subjective ratings of emotional stimuli in task 1, p values = .653-.667; electrodermal activity: p values = .224-.837), ER (task 1: p values = .077-.731; heart rate variability: p values = .522-.832), or regulatory choice (task 2: p = .380). Although individuals with SSD were equally effective in state ER (task 1), they perceived ER during the task as significantly more effortful ( p = .038, d = -0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that dysregulated emotions might not result from lacking abilities in implementing ER effectively, but rather could arise from less frequent ER initiation because ER is perceived as more effortful.",2022,Nov-Dec 01,Psychosom Med,84,9,1077-1086,35980776.0,10.1097/PSY.0000000000001118,,#1301,Schnabel 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Associations between informant ratings of personality disorder traits, self-reports of personality, and directly observed behavior","Kaurin, A.; Sauerberger, K. S.; Funder, D. C.","OBJECTIVE: Diagnoses of personality disorders (PD) must rely on judgments of observers-either clinicians or acquaintances-because personality disorders are primarily defined in terms of maladaptive interpersonal behavior. Little is known, however, about how closely acquaintances' judgments of PD traits relate to self-reports of theoretically relevant Big Five traits or directly observed behavioral outcomes in interpersonal situations. The present study examines associations between judgments of the 10 PD traits provided by close acquaintances, self-reports of PD-relevant Big Five personality traits, and observed interpersonal behaviors across three different three-person laboratory interactions (i.e., unstructured chat, cooperative task, competitive game). METHOD: The sample consisted of 256 undergraduate students (130 females; M(age) = 19.83, SD = 1.25). Four unacquainted observers independently rated participants' behaviors from video recordings. RESULTS: In line with previous work, informant reports of PD traits demonstrate strong convergent validity with relevant self-reported Big Five traits (as identified by Lynam & Widiger, 2001). Directly observed behavior is meaningfully associated with acquaintances' judgments and self-reports of PD-relevant traits, and the associations between these judgments and behavior are strongest for traits associated with histrionic and schizoid PD. Vector correlations between behavioral profiles associated with informant and self-reports show that both assessments have similar behavioral correlates. Associations between PD trait ratings and behavior appeared to differ as a function of gender, with males showing more and stronger correlations. CONCLUSIONS: Informants' ratings of PD traits are impressively accurate, converging both with self-reports of relevant traits and directly observed interpersonal behavior. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of PDs and associated traits can be augmented by information from multiple acquaintances who have the opportunity to observe how an individual interacts with others on a daily basis across diverse contexts.",2018,Dec,J Pers,86,6,1078-1101,29498425.0,10.1111/jopy.12376,,#1303,Kaurin 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen): a valid instrument for early detection of adolescent depression in mental health care,"Allgaier, A. K.; Krick, K.; Saravo, B.; Schulte-Korne, G.","OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of comorbid depressive disorder is challenging, even in mental health care. Screening instruments could be economic tools in indicating depression. For the first time, the current study investigates the validity of the newly developed Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen) and its abbreviated five-item form DesTeen-a in a mental health setting. METHODS: A total of 88 patients aged 13-16 years were recruited in institutions specialized in child and adolescent psychiatry, psychotherapy or psychosomatic medicine. DSM-IV-TR diagnoses of major depression or dysthymia based on a structured diagnostic interview served as the gold standard for validation. For assessing the criterion validity of the DesTeen and the DesTeen-a, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Specificity and sensitivity were computed for optimal cut-off scores according to the Youden Index. RESULTS: Point prevalence of depression was 27.3%. Diagnostic accuracy of the DesTeen was high (AUC=.94). Using a cut-off score of >/= 18, sensitivity was .96 and specificity was .86. The DesTeen-a showed no loss in validity (AUC=.94). At a cut-off point of >/= 6, sensitivity remained excellent (.96), while specificity was slightly lower (.80). LIMITATIONS: The limited representativeness and the small sample size restrict the generalizability of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: The DesTeen and its abbreviated version are valid instruments to screen for adolescent depression in mental health care.

Interpersonal Emotion Dynamics in Couples With Somatic Symptom Disorder: Dyadic Coherence in Facial Temperature During Emotional Interactions,"Okur Guney, Z. E.; Cardone, D.; Sattel, H.; Ariens, S.; Witthoft, M.; Merla, A.; Kuppens, P.; Henningsen, P.","OBJECTIVE: Disturbances in emotional processes are commonly reported in patients with a somatic symptom disorder (SSD). Although emotions usually occur in social interactions, little is known about interpersonal emotion dynamics of SSD patients during their actual emotional encounters. This study examined physiological coherence (linkage) between SSD patients and their partners, and in healthy couples during their emotional interactions. Secondarily, we explored group-level relationships between participants' and their partners' subjective affect. METHODS: Twenty-nine romantic couples (16 healthy and 13 SSD patient-couples) underwent a dyadic conversation task with neutral and anger-eliciting topics followed by a guided relaxation. Partners' cutaneous facial temperature was recorded simultaneously by functional infrared thermal imaging. Immediately after each condition, participants reported on their pain intensity, self-affect, and perceived partner-affect. RESULTS: Emotional conditions and having a partner with an SSD significantly affected coherence amplitude on the forehead (F(2,54) = 4.95, p = .011) and nose tip temperature (F(2,54) = 3.75, p = .030). From baseline to anger condition, coherence amplitude significantly increased in the patient-couples, whereas it decreased in the healthy couples. Correlation changes between partners' subjective affect comparably accompanied the changes in physiological coherence in healthy and patient-couples. CONCLUSIONS: Inability to reduce emotional interdependence in sympathetic activity and subjective affect during a mutual conflict observed in SSD patient-couples seems to capture emotion co-dysregulation.

Obsessive-compulsive symptoms in eating disorders: A network investigation,"Meier, M.; Kossakowski, J. J.; Jones, P. J.; Kay, B.; Riemann, B. C.; McNally, R. J.","OBJECTIVE: Eating disorders (EDs) are complex, heterogeneous, and severe psychiatric syndromes. They are highly comorbid with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) which exacerbates the course of illness and impedes treatment. However, the direct functional relations between EDs and OCD symptoms remain largely unexplored. Hence, using network analysis, we investigated the relationship between ED and OCD at the level of symptoms in a heterogeneous clinical sample. METHOD: We used cross sectional data of 303 treatment-seeking patients with clinically relevant ED and OCD pathology. We constructed a regularized partial correlation network that featured both ED and OCD symptoms as nodes. To determine each symptom's influence, we calculated expected influence (EI) as an index of symptom centrality (i.e., ""importance""). Bridge symptoms (i.e., symptoms from one syndromic cluster that have strong connections to symptoms of another syndromic cluster) were identified by computing bridge expected influence metrics. RESULTS: Fear of weight gain and dietary restraint were especially important among the ED symptoms. Interference due to obsessions was the key feature of OCD. ED and OCD clustered distinctly with few potential bridges between clusters. DISCUSSION: This study underscores the importance of cognitive symptoms for both ED and OCD although direct functional links between the two clusters are missing.

"What matters: Money, values, perceived negative life events? Explanative factors in embitterment","Muschalla, B.; von Kenne, J.","OBJECTIVE: Embitterment can occur as a reaction to unjust life events that damage the person's life values. It can be associated with severe impairment of the ability to work or participate in life generally. Socioeconomic status, general mental well-being, and number of perceived negative life events are all factors that may be related to embitterment. A better understanding of this is necessary for diagnostics and intervention planning Method: This observational study investigates the role of socioeconomic status (net monthly income), perceived negative life events, and life values in relation to embitterment perception. Two hundred eighty-one people from the general population and primary care offices completed a survey. RESULTS: People with high levels of embitterment reported more negative life events and had lower general well-being and lower income. However, they had similar values to those with a low perception of embitterment. Age, well-being, and the number of perceived negative life events explained the degree of embitterment more than values. The types of negative life events reported were similar in the different income groups; general blow of fates and injustice from a person who was privately important to them were reported most often. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the potential influences of socioeconomic status and general well-being on embitterment and potentially associated illness development. Although life values are important in the individual etiology of embitterment disorders (PTED), there is no specific life value which is generally susceptible to embitterment.

Exposure in sensu to a fictive unjust situation and perspective change does not result in reduced embitterment-An experimental study,"Muschalla, B.","OBJECTIVE: Embitterment can occur as a reaction to unjust life events which damage the person's life values. It can lead to impairment of work ability and participation in life generally. Methods to reduce embitterment have been developed and tested in clinical samples. Perspective-change is a core method which can be trained in order to get distance from a hurting event and reduce embitterment. METHOD: This experimental study investigates whether perspective-change can be used as a 1-shot mini-intervention to reduce subclinical embitterment. People (N = 155) from the general population completed the experiment. They were first asked about their life values, whether they had experienced and were still affected by a hurting event, and their degree of embitterment. Then a fictive unjust situation (downgrading at work) was presented, and the person was asked to project his or her thoughts into the described situation. Randomly, one half of the participants were given instructions for a perspective change in order to relativize the meaning of the hurting event. Degree of embitterment was again assessed after exposure to the fictive situation. RESULTS: Embitterment was not significantly reduced after in comparison to before the fictive situation. There were no differences between the group that received instructions for perspective-change and the group which did not. CONCLUSION: An ultrashort intervention by means of exposure to a fictive unjust situation and perspective-change did not result in the reduction of individual embitterment. Relevant reduction of individual embitterment may require exposure to the own individual unjust event, and several or repeated trainings of perspective-change.

"Emotional reactivity, suppression of emotions and response inhibition in emotional eaters: A multi-method pilot study","Wolz, I.; Biehl, S.; Svaldi, J.","OBJECTIVE: Emotional eating has been associated with high emotional reactivity, suppression of negative emotions and inhibitory control difficulties. The current study aimed to address the association of these factors and their combined effect on emotional eating. METHOD: Twenty-eight participants conducted an emotional Go/Nogo task including pictures of neutral, negative and positive scenes and an additional emotion suppression condition. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded continuously. Emotional eating and habitual emotion suppression were assessed through questionnaires. Emotional reactivity to affective pictures was measured through a visual analogue scale and the amplitude of the electrophysiological late positive potential (LPP). Inhibition parameters were assessed behaviorally (i.e., commission errors) and through event-related potentials of the EEG (i.e., N2/P3-amplitudes). RESULTS: The trait questionnaire data revealed that emotional eating was not correlated with habitual emotion suppression. During the emotional Go/Nogo paradigm, higher emotional eating scores were positively related to higher LPP amplitudes in response to negative affective scenes. Inhibitory control capacities were not related to emotional eating while watching neutral or negative pictures, but higher emotional eating scores were associated with more commission errors when negative emotions were suppressed. DISCUSSION: Emotional eating tendencies seem to be related to higher reactivity when confronted with negative affective information and inhibitory control deficits may arise especially when an effort is made to suppress these negative emotions. Therefore, a focus on adaptive emotion regulation in treatments of emotional eating seems to be important; solely targeting inhibitory control capacities may not be sufficient in order to help people with emotional eating to regulate their food intake.",2021,Jun 1,Appetite,161,,105142,33539909.0,10.1016/j.appet.2021.105142,,#1309,Wolz 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Modest, yet progressive: Effective therapists tend to rate therapeutic change less positively than their patients","Ziem, M.; Hoyer, J.","Objective: Empirical findings on self-serving biases amongst psychotherapists are inconsistent. We tested in a large naturalistic data set, if therapists are prone to illusory superiority when estimating their patients' outcome and whether this effect is buffered by therapists' effectiveness. Method: A post-hoc analysis with N = 69 therapists, who treated N = 1080 patients, was conducted. Therapists' and patients' mean ratings for therapeutic improvement in the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) were compared. Using a multilevel modelling approach, we further investigated the relation between the patient-therapist divergence in the CGI and actual therapeutic change in the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory and in the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Results: Ratings in the CGI did not show significant differences between patients' and therapists' assessment of therapeutic change. Lower estimations by therapists, compared to patients' self-report, were associated with greater therapeutic change in GSI and SWLS. Conclusions: Therapists, on a whole, did not seem to be prone to illusory superiority when assessing therapeutic outcome.

Cognitive remediation therapy in anorexia nervosa-A randomized clinical trial,"Brockmeyer, T.; Schmidt, H.; Leiteritz-Rausch, A.; Zimmermann, J.; Wunsch-Leiteritz, W.; Leiteritz, A.; Friederich, H. C.","Objective: Especially for adult patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), treatment response is generally low to moderate. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) as adjunctive treatment for AN regarding clinical and cognitive outcomes. Method: In this randomized controlled superiority trial, 167 adult and adolescent (>/=17 years) patients with AN were randomly allocated (1:1) to 10 weekly sessions of group therapy of either CRT (n = 82) or art therapy (ART; n = 85) as an adjunct to inpatient treatment-as-usual (TAU). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, end-of-treatment (10 weeks), and 6-month follow-up. Change in body mass index (BMI), eating disorder psychopathology, and health-related quality of life (QoL) from baseline to 6-month follow-up served as primary outcomes. Improvements in motivation to change and several indices of set-shifting and central coherence between baseline and end-of-treatment and between baseline and 6-month follow-up served as secondary outcomes. Analysis was by intention to treat. Results: Treatment groups did not differ regarding change in BMI, eating disorder psychopathology, and health-related QoL from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Likewise, groups neither differed regarding improvements in these outcomes between baseline and end-of-treatment nor in motivation to change, set-shifting, and central coherence at any time, except for greater short-term improvements in one measure of set-shifting in the CRT group. Conclusions: CRT as an adjunct to inpatient TAU for AN was not efficacious in improving clinical and cognitive outcomes. The results do not support routine employment of CRT in inpatient treatment for AN.

Approach bias and cue reactivity towards food in people with high versus low levels of food craving,"Brockmeyer, T.; Hahn, C.; Reetz, C.; Schmidt, U.; Friederich, H. C.","OBJECTIVE: Even though people suffering from high levels of food craving are aware of the negative consequences of binge eating, they cannot resist. Automatic action tendencies (i.e. approach bias) towards food cues that operate outside conscious control may contribute to this dysfunctional behavior. The present study aimed to examine whether people with high levels of food craving show a stronger approach bias for food than those with low levels of food craving and whether this bias is associated with cue-elicited food craving. METHOD: Forty-one individuals reporting either extremely high or extremely low levels of trait food craving were recruited via an online screening and compared regarding approach bias towards visual food cues by means of an implicit stimulus-response paradigm (i.e. the Food Approach-Avoidance Task). State levels of food craving were assessed before and after cue exposure to indicate food cue reactivity. RESULTS: As expected, high food cravers showed stronger automatic approach tendencies towards food than low food cravers. Also in line with the hypotheses, approach bias for food was positively correlated with the magnitude of change in state levels of food craving from pre-to post-cue exposure in the total sample. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that an approach bias in early stages of information processing contributes to the inability to resist food intake and may be of relevance for understanding and treating dysfunctional eating behavior.",2015,Dec,Appetite,95,,197-202,26184338.0,10.1016/j.appet.2015.07.013,,#1312,Brockmeyer 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Are guided internet-based interventions for the indicated prevention of depression in green professions effective in the long run? Longitudinal analysis of the 6- and 12-month follow-up of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (PROD-A),"Braun, L.; Titzler, I.; Terhorst, Y.; Freund, J.; Thielecke, J.; Ebert, D. D.; Baumeister, H.","OBJECTIVE: Evidence of long-term stability for positive mental health effects of internet-based interventions (IBIs) for depression prevention is still scarce. We evaluate long-term effectiveness of a depression prevention program in green professions (i.e. agriculture, horticulture, forestry). METHODS: This pragmatic RCT (n = 360) compares a tailored IBI program to enhanced treatment as usual (TAU+) in green professions with at least subthreshold depression (PHQ >/= 5). Intervention group (IG) received one of six IBIs shown previously to efficaciously reduce depressive symptoms. We report 6- and 12-month follow-up measures for depression, mental health and intervention-related outcomes. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol regression analyses were conducted for each measurement point and complemented by latent growth modeling. RESULTS: After 6 months, depression severity (beta = -0.30, 95%-CI: -0.52; -0.07), insomnia (beta = -0.22, 95%-CI: -0.41; -0.02), pain-associated disability (beta = -0.26, 95%-CI: -0.48; -0.04) and quality of life (beta = 0.29, 95%-CI: 0.13; 0.45) in IG were superior to TAU+. Onset of possible depression was not reduced. After 12 months, no intervention effects were found. Longitudinal modeling confirmed group effects attenuating over 12 months for most outcomes. After 12 months, 55.56% of IG had completed at least 80% of their IBI. CONCLUSIONS: Stability of intervention effects along with intervention adherence was restricted.

Death anxiety as general factor to fear of cancer recurrence,"Berlin, P.; von Blanckenburg, P.","OBJECTIVE: Fear of cancer recurrence or progress is strongly related to death anxiety (DA) in cancer patients, but due to lack of conceptualization and measurement methods, the relationship was not analyzed quantitatively before. The aim of the present study was to investigate the conceptual relationship of both constructs, with DA expected to be the general construct. METHODS: Cancer patients (N = 121) participated in an online study. They provided information on socio-demographical, medical and psychological measures including DA and fear of cancer recurrence or progression (FoP-Q-SF). Relation of constructs was assessed using a two-step process: Confirming individual construct structure with confirmatory factor analysis, including correlation of constructs and modification of measurement model, followed by structural equation modeling and comparison of structure models for best model fit. RESULTS: The measurement model was modified to include three residual correlations within and between constructs. Comparison of structure models supported a bifactor structure with DA as general factor and fear of recurrence or progression as group factor: SBchi(2) (173) = 207.74 (p < 0.05), SB = 1.538, relative chi(2) = 1.2, rRMSEA = 0.05 [0.01, 0.07] (p > 0.05), SRMR = 0.07, CFI = 0.94, AIC = 7543.60.

The German Version of the Gaze Anxiety Rating Scale (GARS): Reliability and Validity,"Domes, G.; Marx, L.; Spenthof, I.; Heinrichs, M.","OBJECTIVE: Fear of eye gaze and avoidance of eye contact are core features of social anxiety disorders (SAD). To measure self-reported fear and avoidance of eye gaze, the Gaze Anxiety Rating Scale (GARS) has been developed and validated in recent years in its English version. The main objectives of the present study were to psychometrically evaluate the German translation of the GARS concerning its reliability, factorial structure, and validity. METHODS: Three samples of participants were enrolled in the study. (1) A non-patient sample (n = 353) completed the GARS and a set of trait questionnaires to assess internal consistency, test-retest reliability, factorial structure, and concurrent and divergent validity. (2) A sample of patients with SAD (n = 33) was compared to a healthy control group (n = 30) regarding their scores on the GARS and the trait measures. RESULTS: The German GARS fear and avoidance scales exhibited excellent internal consistency and high stability over 2 and 4 months, as did the original version. The English version's factorial structure was replicated, yielding two categories of situations: (1) everyday situations and (2) situations involving high evaluative threat. GARS fear and avoidance displayed convergent validity with trait measures of social anxiety and were markedly higher in patients with GSAD than in healthy controls. Fear and avoidance of eye contact in situations involving high levels of evaluative threat related more closely to social anxiety than to gaze anxiety in everyday situations. CONCLUSIONS: The German version of the GARS has demonstrated reliability and validity similar to the original version, and is thus well suited to capture fear and avoidance of eye contact in different social situations as a valid self-report measure of social anxiety and related disorders in the social domain for use in both clinical practice and research.",2016,2016/03/03,PLOS ONE,11,3,e0150807,26937638.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0150807,,#1315,Domes 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Central Nervous System Processing of Emotions in Children with Fecal Incontinence and Constipation,"Equit, M.; Niemczyk, J.; Kluth, A.; Thomas, C.; Rubly, M.; von Gontard, A.","OBJECTIVE: Fecal incontinence and constipation are common disorders in childhood. The enteric nervous system and the central nervous system are highly interactive along the brain-gut axis. The interaction is mainly afferent. These afferent pathways include centers that are involved in the central nervous processing of emotions as the mid/posterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex. A previous study revealed altered processing of emotions in children with fecal incontinence. The present study replicates these results. METHODS: In order to analyze the processing of emotions, we compared the event-related potentials of 25 children with fecal incontinence and constipation to those of 15 control children during the presentation of positive, negative, and neutral pictures.

Does Social Exclusion Alter Sensory and Pain Thresholds in Children and Adolescents with Functional Abdominal Pain? - Results from a Preliminary Study,"Gulewitsch, M. D.; Jusyte, A.; Weimer, K.; Schonenberg, M.","OBJECTIVE: Functional abdominal pain (AP) is a prevalent issue in childhood and adolescence. The contribution of psychosocial factors in the development and maintenance of this health problem is rather unclear, and experimental studies about underlying mechanisms are lacking. This study investigates whether experimentally induced social exclusion decreases sensory and pain thresholds in children suffering from AP. SUBJECTS: Twenty children/adolescents with AP and 22 healthy controls. METHODS: Children/adolescents participated in the Cyberball paradigm, which affects an experience of social exclusion. Thermal sensory and pain thresholds were measured before and after Cyberball. RESULTS: Children/adolescents with AP showed a divergent reaction regarding their sensory threshold after social exclusion: The control group exhibited a tendency toward a decreased sensory threshold whereas the AP group remained stable. Concerning the pain threshold, no effect of social exclusion could be identified. The increase of both thresholds (""numbing"") after Cyberball was positively correlated with symptoms of mental health issues. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate changes in sensory and pain thresholds following painful social interactions in a sample of children/adolescents with a chronic pain condition. Results suggest that AP and control children differ in their reaction of sensory thresholds, which might indicate an altered processing of social exclusion.

Describe Your Feelings: Body Illusion Related to Alexithymia in Adolescence,"Georgiou, E.; Mai, S.; Pollatos, O.","Objective: Having access to bodily signals is known to be crucial for differentiating the self from others and coping with negative feelings. The interplay between bodily and emotional processes develops in adolescence, where vulnerability is high, as negative affect states often occur, that could hamper the integration of bodily input into the self. Aim of the present study in healthy adolescents was to examine, whether a disturbed emotional awareness, described by the alexithymic construct, could trigger a higher malleability in the sense of body-ownership. Methods: Fifty-four healthy adolescents aged between 12 to 17 years participated in this study. The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Screening psychischer Storungen im Jugendalter were used to assess emotional distress and conduct problems. Alexithymia was assessed by the TAS-20. The rubber hand illusion was implemented for examining the malleability of body-ownership. Results: A higher body illusion was found to be connected with ""difficulties in describing feelings"". Moreover, a higher degree of self-reported conduct and emotional problems as assessed by the SDQ were associated with a more pronounced body illusion. Further findings revealed an association between emotional distress and the emotional alexithymia subscales ""difficulties in identifying feelings"" and ""difficulties in describing feelings"". Conclusion: Our findings emphasize a close link between the sense of body-ownership and emotional awareness as assessed by emotional facets of the alexithymic trait. We suggest that in adolescents with higher malleability of body-ownership, a vicious circle might occur where affect and integration of different proprioceptive signals regarding the body become more entangled.",2016,2016/10/28,Front Psychol,7,,1690,27840618.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01690,,#1318,Georgiou 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
It's all a matter of necessity and concern: A structural equation model of adherence to antihypertensive medication,"Wilhelm, M.; Rief, W.; Doering, B. K.","OBJECTIVE: Hypertension is often treated pharmacologically, yet adherence is poor. Beliefs about antihypertensive medicine, i.e., the necessity-concern framework (NCF), are valuable for explaining adherence. Therefore, a model structure is transferred from hypercholesterolemia to hypertension, assuming a mediating role of the NCF. METHODS: Patients with hypertension (n=273) were surveyed online about demographics, health- and treatment-related factors, control beliefs, necessity and concern beliefs about their medication, and adherence. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS: Necessity was positively (beta=0.26, p=0.009) and concern was negatively (beta=-0.51, p=0.020) associated with adherence. The NCF mediated the influence of background variables on adherence. Necessity was associated with comorbidity (beta=-0.36, p<0.001), treatment time (beta=0.19, p=0.004), emotionally supportive doctor-patient communication (beta=0.12, p=0.045), side effects (beta=0.16, p=0.013), personal control (beta=-0.13, p=0.022), and treatment control (beta=0.29, p<0.001). Concern was associated with side effects (beta=0.38, p<0.001) and beliefs about medicine in general being harmful (beta=0.61, p<0.001). The model fit was acceptable (RMSEA=0.61).

Classification criteria for distinguishing cortisol responders from nonresponders to psychosocial stress: evaluation of salivary cortisol pulse detection in panel designs,"Miller, R.; Plessow, F.; Kirschbaum, C.; Stalder, T.","OBJECTIVE: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity to acute stimulation is frequently assessed by repeated sampling of salivary cortisol. Researchers often strive to distinguish between individuals who show (responders) and those do not show (nonresponders) cortisol responses. For this, fixed threshold classification criteria, such as a 2.5-nmol/l baseline-to-peak increase, are frequently used. However, the performance of such criteria has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS: Repeated salivary cortisol data from 504 participants exposed to either the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; n = 309) or a placebo protocol (n = 195) were used for analyses. To obtain appropriate classifications of cortisol responders versus nonresponders, a physiologically plausible, autoregressive latent trajectory (ALT) mixture model was fitted to these data. Response classifications according to the ALT model and information on the experimental protocol (TSST versus placebo TSST) were then used to evaluate the performance of different proposed classifier proxies by receiver operating characteristics. RESULTS: Moment structure of cortisol time series was adequately accounted for by the proposed ALT model. The commonly used 2.5-nmol/l criterion was found to be overly conservative, resulting in a high rate of 16.5% false-negative classifications. Lowering this criterion to 1.5 nmol/l or using a percentage baseline-to-peak increase of 15.5% as a threshold yielded improved performance (39.3% and 26.7% less misclassifications, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Alternative classification proxies (1.5 nmol/l or 15.5% increase) are able to effectively distinguish between cortisol responders and nonresponders and should be used in future research, whenever statistical response class allocation is not feasible.",2013,Nov-Dec,Psychosom Med,75,9,832-40,24184845.0,10.1097/PSY.0000000000000002,,#1320,Miller 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Somatic Symptom Perception From a Predictive Processing Perspective: An Empirical Test Using the Thermal Grill Illusion,"Brascher, A. K.; Sutterlin, S.; Scheuren, R.; Van den Bergh, O.; Witthoft, M.","OBJECTIVE: In a predictive processing perspective, symptom perceptions result from an integration of preexisting information in memory with sensory input. Physical symptoms can therefore reflect the relative predominance of either sensory input or preexisting information. In this study, we used the thermal grill illusion (TGI), which applies interlaced warm and cool temperatures to the skin to create a paradoxical heat-pain experience. Assuming that the TGI compared with single-temperature stimulation relies more importantly on an active integration process of the brain to create this paradoxical sensation, we tested the hypothesis whether a manipulation of the expectations during TGI would have more impact than during single-temperature stimulation. METHODS: Sixty-four participants received different temperature combinations (16/16 degrees C, 40/40 degrees C, 16/40 degrees C) with neutral, positive (""placebo""), and negative (""nocebo"") instructions. Subjective stimulus intensity was rated, and neuroticism and absorption (openness to absorbing and self-altering experiences) served as potential moderating factors. RESULTS: The TGI condition was rated highest. Overall, negative instructions increased (p < .001, d = 0.58), whereas positive instructions did not significantly change the TGI intensity perception (versus neutral; p = .144, d = 0.19). In the TGI condition, increased modulation of pain was observed with higher neuroticism (beta = 0.33, p = .005) and absorption (beta = 0.30, p = .010).

Parent-Child Diagnostic Agreement on Anxiety Symptoms with a Structured Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders in Children,"Popp, L.; Neuschwander, M.; Mannstadt, S.; In-Albon, T.; Schneider, S.","Objective: In clinical structured diagnostic interviews, diagnoses based on parent and child reports have low to moderate agreement. The aims of the present study are (1) to examine diagnostic agreement on anxiety disorders between parents and children on the levels of current and lifetime diagnostic category and diagnoses focusing in particular on diagnostic criteria and (2) to identify parent- and child-related predictors for diagnostic agreement. Method: The sample consisted of 166 parent-child dyads interviewed with the Structured Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders in Children (Kinder-DIPS, Schneider et al., 2009). The children (51.8% girls) were between the ages of 7 and 18 years (M = 10.94; SD = 2.22). Results: Overall, parent-child agreement on the diagnostic category of anxiety disorder (k = 0.21; k = 0.22) and the specific anxiety diagnoses (base rate > 10%) of social phobia, specific phobia and separation anxiety disorder (k = 0.24-0.52; k = 0.19-0.43) and corresponding diagnostic criteria (k = 0.22-0.67; k = 0.24-0.41) were low to moderate with the highest agreement on separation anxiety disorder (k > 0.43). Lower maternal depression, and higher social support reported by mother and father were associated with higher parent-child agreement. Maternal depression was indicated as the strongest predictor. Parental sense of competence, parental anxiety, the amount of parent-child interaction and the child's age and gender had no predictive value. Conclusions: Parent-child agreement can be expected to be higher on the level of anxiety criteria compared to specific anxiety diagnoses and diagnostic anxiety category. Psychological strains in the family-especially maternal depression and low social support-lower the parent-child agreement on anxiety symptoms.

Predicting psychotherapy outcome based on therapist interpersonal skills: A five-year longitudinal study of a therapist assessment protocol,"Schottke, H.; Fluckiger, C.; Goldberg, S. B.; Eversmann, J.; Lange, J.","OBJECTIVE: In the past decade, variation in outcomes between therapists (i.e., therapist effects) have become increasingly recognized as an important factor in psychotherapy. Less is known, however, about what accounts for differences between therapists. The present study investigates the possibility that therapists' basic therapy-related interpersonal skills may impact outcomes. METHOD: To examine this, psychotherapy postgraduate trainees completed both an observer- and an expert-rated behavioral assessment: the Therapy-Related Interpersonal Behaviors (TRIB). TRIB scores were used to predict trainees' outcomes over the course of the subsequent five years. RESULTS: Results indicate that trainees' with more positively rated interpersonal behaviors assessed in the observer-rated group format but not in a single expert-rated format showed superior outcomes over the five-year period. This effect remained controlling for therapist characteristics (therapist gender, theoretical orientation [cognitive behavioral or psychodynamic], amount of supervision, patient's order within therapist's caseload), and patient characteristics (patient age, gender, number of comorbid diagnoses, global severity, and personality disorder diagnosis).

Socioeconomic status and access to psychotherapy,"Niemeyer, H.; Knaevelsrud, C.","OBJECTIVE: Individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) have significantly higher prevalence rates of mental disorders than those with higher SES, but are less likely to receive treatment. Studies from the United States show that individuals with higher SES are more likely to be offered a therapy place than those with low SES. In Germany, where the public health care system is without financial barriers, studies on access to treatment are lacking. METHOD: The present study investigated whether the SES of persons seeking psychotherapeutic help in Germany influences psychotherapists' decision to provide access to treatment. For this purpose, 504 licensed outpatient psychological psychotherapists participated in an online study, in which they read a series of case vignettes and rated how likely they would be to offer treatment in each case. SES was operationalized by occupation and language use. Additionally, we investigated whether treatment offers were affected by the disorder and the gender of the help seeker, the therapists' socioeconomic background, and other characteristics in interaction with SES. Bonferroni-corrected multifactorial repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs) and mixed ANOVAs were calculated. RESULTS: Help seekers with low SES were 4.1% less likely to be offered treatment than those with moderate to high SES (F (1, 503) = 115.64; p = 0.000; eta(2) = 0.187). The influence of SES on the probability of a therapy place offer varied significantly depending on the patient's disorder (p = 0.000): SES had a greater effect for bulimia than for depression and social anxiety disorder. Overall, the effect was small (eta(2) = 0.026). No significant interaction between the gender of potential clients and SES was found (p = 0.062). The influence of SES on treatment accessibility varied depending on the therapeutic method for which the therapist was licensed and on the social status of the district in which the therapist's practice was located. The therapist's socioeconomic background (parental SES) did not interact with the potential client's SES. CONCLUSION: Therapist biases contributing to unequal access to treatment for individuals with low SES and other characteristics can aggravate mental health care disparities. Even though the effects we found were relatively modest, awareness of the association between SES and offers of therapy places might help practitioners to reflect on their own selection practices.",2023,Apr,J Clin Psychol,79,4,937-953,36251952.0,10.1002/jclp.23449,,#1327,Niemeyer 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Training cognitive flexibility in patients with anorexia nervosa: a pilot randomized controlled trial of cognitive remediation therapy,"Brockmeyer, T.; Ingenerf, K.; Walther, S.; Wild, B.; Hartmann, M.; Herzog, W.; Bents, H.; Friederich, H. C.","OBJECTIVE: Inefficient cognitive flexibility is considered a neurocognitive trait marker involved in the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa (AN). Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) is a specific treatment targeting this cognitive style. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and efficacy (by estimating the effect size) of specifically tailored CRT for AN, compared to non-specific cognitive training. METHOD: A prospective, randomized controlled, superiority pilot trial was conducted. Forty women with AN receiving treatment as usual (TAU) were randomized to receive either CRT or non-specific neurocognitive therapy (NNT) as an add-on. Both conditions comprised 30 sessions of computer-assisted (21 sessions) and face-to-face (9 sessions) training over a 3-week period. CRT focused specifically on cognitive flexibility. NNT was comprised of tasks designed to improve attention and memory. The primary outcome was performance on a neuropsychological post-treatment assessment of cognitive set-shifting. RESULTS: Data available from 25 treatment completers were analyzed. Participants in the CRT condition outperformed participants in the NNT condition in cognitive set-shifting at the end of the treatment (p = 0.027; between-groups effect size d = 0.62). Participants in both conditions showed high treatment acceptance. DISCUSSION: This study confirms the feasibility of CRT for AN, and provides a first estimate of the effect size that can be achieved using CRT for AN. Furthermore, the present findings corroborate that neurocognitive training for AN should be tailored to the specific cognitive inefficiencies of this patient group.",2014,Jan,Int J Eat Disord,47,1,24-31,24166941.0,10.1002/eat.22206,,#1328,Brockmeyer 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"Same name, same content? Evaluation of DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 prolonged grief criteria","Haneveld, J.; Rosner, R.; Vogel, A.; Kersting, A.; Rief, W.; Steil, R.; Comtesse, H.","OBJECTIVE: Investigating the concordance of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) criteria that have been recently introduced to the 5th text revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) and the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11). METHOD: N = 193 treatment-seeking bereaved adults were assessed with the prolonged grief disorder 13 + 9 interview. Data were examined in terms of (a) diagnostic rates for PGDDSM-5-TR and PGDICD-11, including increases of the PGDICD-11 accessory symptom threshold (PGDICD-11-X+) and time criterion (PGDICD-11-12 months), (b) dimensionality, (c) the frequency with which single PGD symptoms occur, and (d) concurrent validity in terms of psychological symptoms and loss-related characteristics. RESULTS: The diagnostic rate of PGDDSM-5-TR (52%) was significantly lower than that of PGDICD-11 (76%) and agreement between the two criteria sets was moderate, kappa = 0.51, 95% CI [0.47-0.55]. Increasing the PGDICD-11 accessory symptom threshold did not improve the diagnostic agreement. In contrast, increasing the ICD-11 time criterion led to almost perfect agreement between PGDICD-11-12 months and PGDDSM-5-TR, kappa = 0.91, 95% CI [0.89-0.93]. Confirmatory factor analysis results indicated a one-factor model fit best for both PGDDSM-5-TR and PGDICD-11. Emotional pain symptoms (e.g., guilt) were predominantly reported by patients with a PGDICD-11 diagnosis, while attachment disturbance symptoms (e.g., identity disruption) were reported more often by patients with a PGDDSM-5-TR diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite methodological limitations of this study, results indicate discordance in PGDDSM-5-TR and PGDICD-11 regarding diagnostic rates and single symptom occurrence, while the factor structure is similar. Changes in the ICD-11 time criterion could reduce these differences.

Patients' in-session experiences and symptom change: Session-to-session effects on a within- and between-patient level,"Rubel, J. A.; Rosenbaum, D.; Lutz, W.","OBJECTIVE: Knowledge of patients' in-session experiences that lead to symptom change in psychotherapy is limited. This study aims to investigate the within- and between-patient relationships between three in-session processes in psychotherapy (coping skills, therapeutic relationship quality, and emotional involvement) and symptom change on a session-by-session level. METHOD: Participants (n = 1550) with various disorders, including primarily depression and anxiety, were treated with CBT in a German outpatient clinic. Symptom distress was assessed before each session and patients' in-session experiences were assessed at the end of each session using session reports. Person-mean centering was applied to disaggregate within- and between-patients. Within- and between-patient process scores were tested in multilevel models as predictors of next session symptom change. RESULTS: On a within-patient level, better session-specific coping skills, better therapeutic alliance, and deeper emotional involvement were followed by next session symptom improvements. In a combined model, only coping skills specifically predicted next session symptom change. Additionally, these coping skills were especially helpful when combined with a better therapeutic relationship quality. On a between-patient level, better therapeutic alliance and more coping skills were associated with lower symptom scores during treatment, while deeper emotional involvement was associated with higher symptom scores. Testing these between-patient effects in a combined model left only coping skills (the more, the greater symptom improvement) and emotional involvement (the deeper, the less symptom improvement) as significant predictors. These two also exhibited a combined effect on symptom change on the between-patient level. DISCUSSION: The results highlight the importance of a thorough disaggregation of within- and between-patient variability in psychotherapy process-outcome research as well as the consideration of several potentially important time-varying covariates. While coping skills showed to be the most central for subsequent symptom change, therapeutic relationship quality only seemed to be a facilitative factor in enhancing these effects, but was not sufficiently helpful on its own.",2017,Mar,Behav Res Ther,90,,58-66,27998800.0,10.1016/j.brat.2016.12.007,,#1330,Rubel 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

This study was based on a large international sample and aimed to explore the role of early maladaptive schemas (EMS) in predicting vulnerability to burnout, as well as attendant effects on short-term physical health, in clinical and counseling postgraduate psychology trainees. METHOD: An online, quantitative, cross-sectional survey method design was used to collect self-report data that measured burnout, EMS, and physical health from 1,297 trainees. RESULTS: Only the unrelenting standards (US) schema predicted high burnout among trainees. The most commonly endorsed physical health symptoms were back and neck pain and tiredness, and were more severe for those experiencing high burnout.

Long-Term Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Routine Outpatient Care: A 5- to 20-Year Follow-Up Study,"von Brachel, R.; Hirschfeld, G.; Berner, A.; Willutzki, U.; Teismann, T.; Cwik, J. C.; Velten, J.; Schulte, D.; Margraf, J.","OBJECTIVE: Long-term follow-ups several years after receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are scarce and most of the existing literature describes follow-up data of randomized-controlled trials. Thus, very little is known about the long-term effects of CBT in routine care. METHODS: We investigated psychological functioning in a sample of 263 former outpatients who had received CBT for a variety of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety-, eating- or somatoform disorders 8.06 (SD 5.08) years after treatment termination. All participants completed a diagnostic interview as well as the Brief-Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Effect sizes and response rates according to Jacobson and Truax [J Consult Clin Psychol 1991;59:12-9] were calculated from pre- to posttreatment and from pretreatment to follow-up assessment. RESULTS: Pre- to posttreatment effect sizes ranged between 0.75 (BDI) and 0.63 (BSI) and pretreatment to follow-up effect sizes were 0.92 (BDI) and 0.75 (BSI). Of all patients, 29% (BDI) and 17% (BSI) experienced clinically significant change at posttreatment and 42% (BDI) and 24% (BSI) at follow-up. CONCLUSION: The results point to the long-term effectiveness of CBT under routine conditions for a wide array of problems, especially when compared to the long-term effects of medical treatment.

After the weight reduction phase (week 13) and the weight loss maintenance phase (week 52), participants' BMI was re-assessed. RESULTS: Baseline BMI, inhibitory control and food liking alone did not predict weight loss. As hypothesised, however, inhibitory control and food liking interactively predicted weight loss from baseline to week 13 and to week 52 (albeit the latter effect was less robust).

Subjective social status and nocturnal blood pressure dipping,"Neubert, M.; Sussenbach, P.; Euteneuer, F.","OBJECTIVE: Low social status has been linked to cardiovascular disease. Subjective social status (SSS), which represents one's perceived position in a social hierarchy, has been suggested to predict health outcomes beyond objective measures of socioeconomic status. The present study examined if lower SSS is related to reduced nocturnal blood pressure (BP) dipping, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a community sample of 53 healthy adults underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring. All participants provided information on SSS and objective measures of socioeconomic status (i.e., education, occupation, and income). SSS was measured in comparison to others in the country (national SSS) as well as in comparison to one's social environment (local SSS) using the German versions of the MacArthur Scales. RESULTS: Analyses found that participants with low local SSS exhibited attenuated nocturnal diastolic blood pressure dipping (beta = 0.29, 95% CI [0.01, 0.57], p = .043) and mean arterial pressure dipping (beta = 0.29, 95% CI [0.01, 0.57], p = .041). These associations remained significant after adjusting for objective socioeconomic status. No significant associations between national SSS and cardiovascular measures were observed.

Co-occurrence of major depressive episode and posttraumatic stress disorder among survivors of war: how is it different from either condition alone?,"Morina, N.; Ajdukovic, D.; Bogic, M.; Franciskovic, T.; Kucukalic, A.; Lecic-Tosevski, D.; Morina, L.; Popovski, M.; Priebe, S.","OBJECTIVE: Major depressive episode (MDE) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to be the most common mental disorders following traumatic war experiences and have been found to frequently co-occur. This study, designed as a randomized cross-sectional interview survey, aimed to identify whether the co-occurence of MDE and PTSD following exposure to war-related experiences is associated with different demographics, exposure to previous traumatic events, and clinical characteristics than either condition alone. METHOD: After a random-walk technique was used to randomly select participants, face-to-face interviews were conducted among war-affected community samples in 5 Balkan countries (N = 3,313) in the years 2006 and 2007. The mean age of participants was 42.3 years, and all participants had experienced potentially traumatic events during war in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Current prevalence rates of MDE and PTSD and suicide risk were assessed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Levels of general psychological distress, posttraumatic stress, and quality of life were assessed with self-reports. RESULTS: 30.5% of the sample met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for either MDE or PTSD, and 9.1% had both disorders. Participants with concomitant MDE and PTSD reported significantly higher numbers of prewar and postwar traumatic events than participants with PTSD only and higher numbers of war-related events than those with MDE only (all P values < .001). Participants with both MDE and PTSD had significantly higher levels of general psychological and posttraumatic stress symptoms, a higher suicide risk, and lower levels of quality of life than participants with either condition alone (all P values < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant MDE and PTSD are associated with the experience of different traumatic events and are characterized by more general psychological distress than either condition alone.

Are media warnings about the adverse health effects of modern life self-fulfilling? An experimental study on idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF),"Witthoft, M.; Rubin, G. J.","OBJECTIVE: Medically unsubstantiated 'intolerances' to foods, chemicals and environmental toxins are common and are frequently discussed in the media. Idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) is one such condition and is characterized by symptoms that are attributed to exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF). In this experiment, we tested whether media reports promote the development of this condition. METHODS: Participants (N=147) were randomly assigned to watch a television report about the adverse health effects of WiFi (n=76) or a control film (n=71). After watching their film, participants received a sham exposure to a WiFi signal (15 min). The principal outcome measure was symptom reports following the sham exposure. Secondary outcomes included worries about the health effects of EMF, attributing symptoms to the sham exposure and increases in perceived sensitivity to EMF. RESULTS: 82 (54%) of the 147 participants reported symptoms which they attributed to the sham exposure. The experimental film increased: EMF related worries (beta=0.19; P=.019); post sham exposure symptoms among participants with high pre-existing anxiety (beta=0.22; P=.008); the likelihood of symptoms being attributed to the sham exposure among people with high anxiety (beta=.31; P=.001); and the likelihood of people who attributed their symptoms to the sham exposure believing themselves to be sensitive to EMF (beta=0.16; P=.049).

A randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and a group version of cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy for chronically depressed patients,"Michalak, J.; Schultze, M.; Heidenreich, T.; Schramm, E.","OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has recently been proposed as a treatment option for chronic depression. The cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy (CBASP) is the only approach specifically developed to date for the treatment of chronically depressed patients. The efficacy of MBCT plus treatment-as-usual (TAU), and CBASP (group version) plus TAU, was compared to TAU alone in a prospective, bicenter, randomized controlled trial. METHOD: One hundred and six patients with a current DSM-IV defined major depressive episode and persistent depressive symptoms for more than 2 years were randomized to TAU only (N = 35), or to TAU with additional 8-week group therapy of either 8 sessions of MBCT (n = 36) or CBASP (n = 35). The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (24-item HAM-D, Hamilton, 1967) at the end of treatment. Secondary outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) and measures of social functioning and quality of life. RESULTS: In the overall sample as well as at 1 treatment site, MBCT was no more effective than TAU in reducing depressive symptoms, although it was significantly superior to TAU at the other treatment site. CBASP was significantly more effective than TAU in reducing depressive symptoms in the overall sample and at both treatment sites.

Distinct Functional Connectivity Signatures of Impaired Social Cognition in Multiple Sclerosis,"Golde, S.; Heine, J.; Pottgen, J.; Mantwill, M.; Lau, S.; Wingenfeld, K.; Otte, C.; Penner, I.

M.","Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by impairments in basic cognitive functions such as information processing speed as well as in more complex, higher-order domains such as social cognition. However, as these deficits often co-occur, it has remained challenging to determine whether they have a specific pathological basis or are driven by shared biology. Methods: To identify neural signatures of social cognition deficits in MS, data were analyzed from n = 29 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and n = 29 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and education. We used neuropsychological assessments of information processing speed, attention, learning, working memory, and relevant aspects of social cognition (theory of mind, emotion recognition (ER), empathy) and employed neuroimaging of CNS networks using resting-state functional connectivity. Results: MS patients showed significant deficits in verbal learning and memory, as well as implicit ER. Performance in these domains was uncorrelated. Functional connectivity analysis identified a distinct network characterized by significant associations between poorer ER and lower connectivity of the fusiform gyrus (FFG) with the right lateral occipital cortex, which also showed lower connectivity in patients compared to controls. Moreover, while ER was correlated with MS symptoms such as fatigue and motor/sensory functioning on a behavioral level, FFG connectivity signatures of social cognition deficits showed no overlap with these symptoms.

"Neural correlates of emotional distractibility in bipolar disorder patients, unaffected relatives, and individuals with hypomanic personality","Kanske, P.; Heissler, J.; Schonfelder, S.; Forneck, J.; Wessa, M.","OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychological deficits and emotion dysregulation are present in symptomatic and euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. However, there is little evidence on how cognitive functioning is influenced by emotion, what the neural correlates of emotional distraction effects are, and whether such deficits are a consequence or a precursor of the disorder. The authors used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate these questions. METHOD: fMRI was used first to localize the neural network specific to a certain cognitive task (mental arithmetic) and then to test the effect of emotional distractors on this network. Euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder (N=22), two populations at high risk for developing the disorder (unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder [N=17]), and healthy participants with hypomanic personality traits [N=22]) were tested, along with three age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy comparison groups (N=22, N=17, N=24, respectively). RESULTS: There were no differences in performance or activation in the task network for mental arithmetic. However, while all participants exhibited slower responses when emotional distractors were present, this response slowing was greatly enlarged in bipolar patients. Similarly, task-related activation was generally increased under emotional distraction; however, bipolar patients exhibited a further increase in right parietal activation that correlated positively with the response slowing effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that emotional dysregulation leads to exacerbated neuropsychological deficits in bipolar patients, as evidenced by behavioral slowing and task-related hyperactivation. The lack of such a deficit in high-risk populations suggests that it occurs only after disease onset, rather than representing a vulnerability marker.",2013,Dec,Am J Psychiatry,170,12,1487-96,23982186.0,10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12081044,,#1343,Kanske 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Depression, its comorbidities and treatment, and childhood body mass index trajectories","Schwartz, B. S.; Glass, T. A.; Pollak, J.; Hirsch, A. G.; Bailey-Davis, L.; Moran, T. H.; Bandeen-Roche, K.","OBJECTIVE: No prior studies have evaluated depression diagnoses and cumulative antidepressant use in relation to longitudinal body mass index (BMI) trajectories in a population-representative sample. METHODS: Electronic health record data from 105,163 children ages 8 to 18 years with 314,648 BMI values were used. Depression diagnoses were evaluated as ever versus never, cumulative number of encounters with diagnoses, and total duration of diagnoses. Antidepressants were evaluated as months of use. Associations were evaluated with diagnoses alone, antidepressants alone, and then together, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 6,172 (5.9%) and 10,628 (10.1%) children had a diagnosis of depression or received antidepressant treatment, respectively. At all ages, children receiving Medical Assistance (30.9%) were more likely to be treated with antidepressants. Depression diagnosis and antidepressant use were each independently and positively associated with BMI trajectories; associations were stronger with longer durations of diagnosis and treatment. Among children who received 12 or more months of antidepressants (vs. none), the mean (95% CI) weight gain at 18 years associated with antidepressant use (all classes) was 2.10 (1.76-2.45) kg.

Food through the child's eye: An eye-tracking study on attentional bias for food in healthy-weight children and children with obesity,"Werthmann, J.; Jansen, A.; Vreugdenhil, A. C.; Nederkoorn, C.; Schyns, G.; Roefs, A.","OBJECTIVE: Obesity prevalence among children is high and knowledge on cognitive factors that contribute to children's reactivity to the ""obesogenic"" food environment could help to design effective treatment and prevention campaigns. Empirical studies in adults suggest that attention bias for food could be a risk factor for overeating. Accordingly, the current study tested if children with obesity have an elevated attention bias for food when compared to healthy-weight children. Another aim was to explore whether attention biases for food predicted weight-change after 3 and 6 months in obese children. METHOD: Obese children (n = 34) were recruited from an intervention program and tested prior to the start of this intervention. Healthy-weight children (n = 36) were recruited from local schools. First, attention biases for food were compared between children with obesity (n = 30) and matched healthy-weight children (n = 30). Second, regression analyses were conducted to test if food-related attention biases predicted weight changes after 3 and 6 months in children with obesity following a weight loss lifestyle intervention. RESULTS: Results showed that obese children did not differ from healthy-weight children in their attention bias to food. Yet automatically directing attention toward food (i.e., initial orientation bias) was related to a reduced weight loss (R(2) = .14, p = .032) after 6 months in children with obesity. DISCUSSION: High palatable food is a salient stimulus for all children, irrespective of their weight status.

Exposure and CBT for chronic back pain: An RCT on differential efficacy and optimal length of treatment,"Glombiewski, J. A.; Holzapfel, S.; Riecke, J.; Vlaeyen, J. W. S.; de Jong, J.; Lemmer, G.; Rief, W.","OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to establish whether Exposure, a specialized tailored treatment for chronic low back pain, has any advantages over cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) among individuals with high fear-avoidance levels. Second, we planned to compare short and long versions of Exposure. Third, we aimed to investigate whether Exposure can be delivered in an outpatient psychological setting. METHOD: A total of 88 Caucasian participants (55% women) were randomized to three different psychological treatment conditions, Exposure-long, Exposure-short, and CBT. All participants were suffering from chronic pain and elevated levels of pain-related anxiety and disability. The primary outcomes were disability (assessed using two different questionnaires, QBPDS and PDI) and average pain intensity; secondary outcomes included pain-related anxiety, psychological flexibility, coping strategies, and depression. Assessments took place at pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Exposure was more effective than CBT at reducing movement-related disability assessed with the QBPDS. Exposure and CBT did not differ in reduction of pain intensity or disability assessed using the PDI. Exposure-short outperformed Exposure-long after 10 sessions, meaning that individuals improved faster when they were offered fewer sessions. Exposure could be safely delivered in the psychological setting. Concerning secondary outcomes, Exposure led to greater improvements in psychological flexibility relative to CBT. CBT was more effective than Exposure at enhancing coping strategies. In Exposure, significantly more participants dropped out. CONCLUSIONS: Although being more challenging to patients, Exposure is an effective treatment, which can be delivered in a psychological treatment setting and should be offered as a short-term treatment.

Overactive Performance Monitoring as an Endophenotype for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Evidence From a Treatment Study,"Riesel, A.; Endrass, T.; Auerbach, L. A.; Kathmann, N.","OBJECTIVE: Overactive performance monitoring, as measured by the error-related negativity in the event-related brain potential, represents one of the most robust psychophysiological alterations in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It has been proposed as an endophenotype for OCD because it is heritable and more prevalent in families of OCD patients. Consistent with this notion, it is also independent of symptom profile and symptom severity in cross-sectional studies. Longitudinally, it has been shown to be state independent in pediatric patients with OCD. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the state dependency of error monitoring by examining adult OCD patients before and after symptom reduction through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). METHOD: Error-related and correct-related negativity as electrophysiological indicators of performance monitoring were recorded from 45 OCD patients and 39 healthy comparison subjects while performing a flanker task. Patients were assessed before starting and after completing a standard 30-session CBT, including exposure and response prevention, and healthy comparison subjects were tested after a comparable time interval. RESULTS: Pretreatment, patients with OCD were characterized by enhanced error-related and correct-related negativity compared with healthy comparison subjects. This difference persisted after treatment when symptoms were substantially reduced. There was no significant correlation between symptom improvement and changes in performance monitoring and no difference in performance monitoring between treatment responders and nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first longitudinal study in adult OCD patients showing stability of enhanced error monitoring following successful symptom reduction through CBT. It supports the hypothesis that overactive performance monitoring is an endophenotype that indicates vulnerability for OCD.",2015,Jul,Am J Psychiatry,172,7,665-73,25783756.0,10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.14070886,,#1348,Riesel 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
A psycho-oncological online intervention supporting partners of patients with cancer (PartnerCARE): Results from a randomized controlled feasibility trial,"Bodschwinna, D.; Lorenz, I.; Bauereiss, N.; Gundel, H.; Baumeister, H.; Honig, K.","OBJECTIVE: Partners of cancer patients are the primary supporters and burdened at the same time. Support for partners is hitherto scarce and existing offers are rarely used. The PartnerCARE online intervention was specifically developed to address the caregiving partners' needs. This two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of PartnerCARE. METHODS: Sixty German-speaking partners of patients with various cancer entities were randomized into two conditions: intervention group (IG) with PartnerCARE (N = 30) or waitlist-control group (N = 30). Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1) and 4-months follow-up (T2). Feasibility and acceptability outcomes included dropout rates, use and acceptance of PartnerCARE, individual user/e-coach feedback as well as negative effects. Relevant efficacy outcomes were assessed to test for potential intervention effects. RESULTS: Recruitment success illustrates demand for and acceptability of PartnerCARE. Satisfaction with the intervention was high (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire adapted to Internet-based interventions, T1: M = 24.66, SD = 6.42) and 73.3% of participants completed the intervention. Study dropout rate was low (T1: 17%, T2: 29%). More positive than negative side effects of the intervention were identified, and negative ones were mainly related to ""intrapersonal change"". For efficacy outcomes we found effects over time, with strongest effects within the IG from T0 to T1 in psychological distress (d = 0.73, 95%-CI: [0.34; 1.12]) and anxiety (0.66, [0.26; 1.04]), but no group effects were significant at T1 and T2. CONCLUSIONS: PartnerCARE is feasible, acceptable and potentially efficacious.

Dyadic coping and social support: Various types of support in hematooncological patients and their spouses-Associations with psychological distress,"Bodschwinna, D.; Ernst, J.; Mehnert-Theuerkauf, A.; Gundel, H.; Weissflog, G.; Honig, K.","OBJECTIVE: Patients and spouses use various support strategies to deal with cancer and its associated burden. Support can be perceived within the dyad [perceived dyadic coping (PDC)] or from others [perceived social support (PSS)]. The present study investigates the association of PDC and PSS with depression and anxiety symptoms experienced by hematooncological dyads. METHODS: A total of 330 hematooncological dyads participated in the study. Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI) including perceived stress communication and four PDC strategies (supportive, negative, delegated, common), ENRICHED Social Support Instrument (ESSI) and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) are used for assessment. To take nonindependence of patient's and spouse's variables into account, data are analyzed with the Actor-partner-interdependence model (APIM). RESULTS: Hematological cancer patients and their spouses reported a similar level of depression and anxiety symptoms. Perceived negative dyadic coping (DC) was adversely related with both patient's and spouse's outcomes (all p < 0.01) and perceived positive DC was adversely related with depression symptoms in both and anxiety symptoms in spouses (all p < 0.05). More PSS was associated with less depression and anxiety symptoms in both (all p < 0.05), and spouse's PSS (b = -0.04, p < 0.05) was significantly associated with patient's depression symptoms.

Blunted emotion-modulated startle reflex in anorexia nervosa,"Brockmeyer, T.; Pellegrino, J.; Maier, C.; Munch, H. M.; Harmer, C. J.; Walther, S.; Herzog, W.; Friederich, H. C.","OBJECTIVE: Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) often show difficulties in the perception, expression, and regulation of emotions and a strong avoidance of aversive feelings. According to psychobiological models, dietary restraint and accompanying weight loss may serve as a maladaptive mechanism of emotion regulation by attenuating aversive emotional states in AN, thereby contributing to the maintenance of the disorder. METHOD: Twenty-seven women with AN and 26 age-matched healthy women were shown short film-clips to elicit fear, sadness, amusement, and neutral emotional states. Eyeblink startle response was measured by electromyography in reaction to startle-eliciting acoustic stimuli presented 12 times binaurally during each film-clip. RESULTS: As compared to healthy controls, patients with AN showed a blunted startle response to the fear- but not to the sadness-eliciting stimulus. DISCUSSION: The findings support the assumption that underweight is associated with attenuated emotional reactivity to fear-eliciting material in AN. This is in line with the hypothesis that starvation and low body weight constitute a maladaptive mechanism of emotion regulation in AN, contributing to the maintenance of the disorder.",2019,Mar,Int J Eat Disord,52,3,270-277,30653688.0,10.1002/eat.23022,,#1352,Brockmeyer 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Oxytocin and reduction of social threat hypersensitivity in women with borderline personality disorder,"Bertsch, K.; Gamer, M.; Schmidt, B.; Schmidinger, I.; Walther, S.; Kastel, T.; Schnell, K.; Buchel, C.; Domes, G.; Herpertz, S. C.","OBJECTIVE: Patients with borderline personality disorder are characterized by emotional hyperarousal with increased stress levels, anger proneness, and hostile, impulsive behaviors. They tend to ascribe anger to ambiguous facial expressions and exhibit enhanced and prolonged reactions in response to threatening social cues, associated with enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses. Because the intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to improve facial recognition and to shift attention away from negative social information, the authors investigated whether borderline patients would benefit from oxytocin administration. METHOD: In a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind group design, 40 nonmedicated, adult female patients with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (two patients were excluded based on hormonal analyses) and 41 healthy women, matched on age, education, and IQ, took part in an emotion classification task 45 minutes after intranasal administration of 26 IU of oxytocin or placebo. Dependent variables were latencies and number or initial reflexive eye movements measured by eye tracking, manual response latencies, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses of the amygdala to angry and fearful compared with happy facial expressions. RESULTS: Borderline patients exhibited more and faster initial fixation changes to the eyes of angry faces combined with increased amygdala activation in response to angry faces compared with the control group. These abnormal behavioral and neural patterns were normalized after oxytocin administration. CONCLUSIONS: Borderline patients exhibit a hypersensitivity to social threat in early, reflexive stages of information processing. Oxytocin may decrease social threat hypersensitivity and thus reduce anger and aggressive behavior in borderline personality disorder or other psychiatric disorders with enhanced threat-driven reactive aggression.",2013,Oct,Am J Psychiatry,170,10,1169-77,23982273.0,10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13020263,,#1353,Bertsch 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Efficacy of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback for Somatic Symptom Disorder: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Krempel, L.; Martin, A.","OBJECTIVE: Patients with somatic symptom disorder (SSD) often receive targeted intervention only after a long duration of illness. Moreover, the reported effect sizes of interventions for SSD are small. Therefore, improvement and evaluation of interventions are needed. Preliminary evidence suggests autonomic imbalance, for example, lower heart rate variability (HRV) in SSD. HRV biofeedback (HRV-BF) as a method for self-regulation shows initial positive effects in chronic pain and functional syndromes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a brief HRV-BF intervention for SSD. METHODS: Of a total of 50 participants with SSD ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ) who were recruited and randomly assigned to four sessions of HRV-BF ( n = 25) or autogenic training (AT; n = 25), 49 participants were analyzed (female, 77.6%; mean [standard deviation] age = 45.3 [14.4] years). The primary outcomes were somatic symptom severity (Screening for Somatoform Disorders, numeric rating scale) and HRV. Secondary outcomes were psychological characteristics of SSD (e.g., the Somatic Symptom Disorder 12 scale, health concerns, emotion regulation). The data were collected before and after intervention and were analyzed with repeated-measures analyses of variance and post hoc t tests. RESULTS: Symptom severity improved after both, HRV-BF and AT. Standard Deviation of the NN Interval and psychological symptoms improved significantly more strongly in the HRV-BF than in the AT group (e.g., Standard Deviation of the NN Interval: etap2 interaction = 0.10, p = .047). CONCLUSIONS: The improvements in somatic symptoms, but specifically in cognitive-affective symptoms and autonomic regulation, suggest that HRV-BF with only four sessions is a potentially useful intervention option for SSD. Thus, adding this short HRV-BF intervention to existing psychological treatments for SSD may be promising.Trial Registration : German Clinical Trial Register identifier DRKS00017099 ( https://www.drks.de ).",2023,Jan 1,Psychosom Med,85,1,61-70,36201761.0,10.1097/PSY.0000000000001143,,#1354,Krempel 2023,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

We assessed depressive symptoms with the Patient Heath Questionnaire (PHQ) on average 13years later. Regression analyses were used to relate initial number of teeth to self-reported depression scores. RESULTS: Fewer teeth at the beginning of the treatment were related to higher scores of depressive symptoms, even when controlling for several covariates.

Little is known, however, about their utility in process-outcome research. This study is the first to apply personalized treatment methods in the field of process-outcome research, as demonstrated based on the alliance-outcome association. Method: Using a sample of 741 patients, individual regressions were fitted to estimate within-patient effects of the alliance-outcome association. The Boruta algorithm was used to identify patient intake characteristics that moderate the within-patient alliance-outcome association. The nearest neighbor approach was used to identify patients whose relevant pretreatment characteristics were similar to those of a target patient. The alliance-outcome associations of the most similar patients were subsequently used to predict the alliance-outcome association of the target patient. Results: Irrespective of the number of selected nearest neighbors, the correlation between the observed and predicted alliance-outcome associations was low and insignificant.

Remotely Provided Open-Label Placebo Reduces Frequency of and Impairment by Allergic Symptoms,"Kube, T.; Kirsch, I.; Glombiewski, J. A.; Witthoft, M.; Brascher, A. K.","OBJECTIVE: Placebos being prescribed with full honesty and disclosure (i.e., open-label placebo [OLP]) have been shown to reduce symptom burden in a variety of conditions. With regard to allergic rhinitis, previous research provided inconclusive evidence for the effects of OLP, possibly related to a separate focus on either symptom severity or symptom frequency. Overcoming this limitation of previous research, the present study aimed to examine the effects of OLP on both the severity and frequency of allergic symptoms. METHODS: In a randomized-controlled trial, patients with allergic rhinitis ( N = 74) were randomized to OLP or treatment as usual (TAU). Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was administered remotely in a virtual clinical encounter. Participants took placebo tablets for 14 days. The primary outcomes were the severity and frequency of allergic symptoms. The secondary end point was allergy-related impairment. RESULTS: OLP did not significantly improve symptom severity over TAU ( F (1,71) = 3.280, p = .074, eta2 = 0.044) but did reduce symptom frequency ( F (1,71) = 7.272, p = .009, eta2 = 0.093) and allergy-related impairment more than TAU ( F (1,71) = 6.445, p = .013, eta2 = 0.083), reflecting medium to large effects. The use of other antiallergic medication did not influence the results.

"Work disability in soldiers with posttraumatic stress disorder, posttraumatic embitterment disorder, and not-event-related common mental disorders","Muschalla, B.; Rau, H.; Willmund, G. D.; Knaevelsrud, C.","OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic mental disorders may occur with different affect qualities. Best known is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a conditioned anxiety reaction with intrusions. Another event-related mental disorder is posttraumatic embitterment (PTED), characterized by affect of embitterment and thoughts of revenge, occurring after an event deeply hurting basic beliefs. Knowing about associated disability is important for treatment and sociomedical decisions. This is the first study to explore work-disability in patients with PTSD, PTED, and not-event-related common mental disorder (CMD). METHOD: In this observational study, 101 soldiers (85% men, 31 years, 50% experienced expedition abroad) with different mental disorders were investigated concerning common mental disorders (MINI) and accompanying work capacity impairment (Mini-ICF-APP). Interviews were conducted by a state-licensed psychotherapist with expertise in sociomedical description of (work) capacity impairment. Patients with PTSD, PTED, and other CMD were compared concerning their degrees and pattern of work capacity impairment. RESULTS: PTSD patients (n = 23) were more strongly impaired in mobility as compared to patients with other CMD (n = 64) or PTED. Patients with PTED (n = 14) were more impaired in interactional capacities (contacts with others, group integration) as compared to patients with other CMD or PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD patients need support to improve mobility in (work-relevant) traffic situations. Apart from this, they are not specifically more or less impaired than patients with other CMD. PTED patients should get attention concerning their interactional problems as these may disturb esprit de corps, which is an essential requirement for service in the armed forces.

Using bodily postures in the treatment of anorexia nervosa: Effects of power posing on interoception and affective states,"Weineck, F.; Hauke, G.; Lindemann, H.; Lachenmeir, K.; Schnebel, A.; Karacic, M.; Meule, A.; Voderholzer, U.; Pollatos, O.","OBJECTIVE: Power posing involves the adoption of an expansive bodily posture. This study examined whether power posing could benefit individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) and women with normal weight in regards to interoceptive ability and affective states. METHOD: Participants included 50 inpatients and outpatients with AN as well as 51 normal-weight women. Interoceptive accuracy (IAcc), measured by the heartbeat tracking task and interoceptive sensibility (IS), measured by confidence ratings, were assessed at baseline, after a single power posing session and after 1 week of daily training. Also, the short-term effects of power posing on subjective feelings of dominance, pleasantness, and arousal were investigated. RESULTS: Both groups increased in their IAcc after one power posing session. Also, there was a significant main effect of time on feelings of dominance and pleasantness in the short-term. Women with AN displayed lower levels of IS, dominance, and pleasantness as well as higher levels of arousal than women without AN. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that power posing has the potential to increase IAcc, subjective feelings of power and pleasant affect in the short-term. Further research should investigate which mechanisms foster the effectiveness of this intervention to tailor it to the needs of women with AN.",2021,Mar,Eur Eat Disord Rev,29,2,216-231,33252788.0,10.1002/erv.2813,,#1365,Weineck 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"Do patients with pathological health anxiety fear COVID-19? A time-course analysis of 12 single cases during the ""first wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","Sauer, K.

M.; Bailer, J.; Witthoft, M.","OBJECTIVE: Pre-existing health anxiety is associated with an intensified affective response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Still, results on the reaction of people with a diagnosis of pathological health anxiety (i.e., hypochondriasis) are scarce. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the course of (health) anxiety related to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in comparison to (health) anxiety related to other severe diseases (e.g., cancer) in a sample of 12 patients with the diagnosis of pathological health anxiety during the ""first wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Both SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety and anxiety related to other severe diseases were assessed weekly over 16 measurement points (30.03.-19.07.2020) and primarily analyzed with fixed effects regression analyses. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety was on average significantly lower than anxiety related to other severe diseases (d = -0.54, p < .001) and not significantly associated with anxiety related to other severe diseases or pre-COVID-19 health anxiety. CONCLUSION: It therefore appears premature to assume that SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety and other health worries are necessarily strongly interrelated and comparably high in people with pathological health anxiety.",2021,Dec 1,J Psychosom Res,152,,110687,34875465.0,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110687,,#1366,Sauer 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Improving emotion recognition in anorexia nervosa: An experimental proof-of-concept study,"Preis, M. A.; Schlegel, K.; Stoll, L.; Blomberg, M.; Schmidt, H.; Wunsch-Leiteritz, W.; Leiteritz, A.; Brockmeyer, T.","OBJECTIVE: Previous research has found increasing evidence for difficulties in emotion recognition ability (ERA) and social cognition in anorexia nervosa (AN), and recent models consider these factors to contribute to the development and maintenance of the disorder. However, there is a lack of experimental studies testing this hypothesis. Therefore, the present proof-of-concept study examined whether ERA can be improved by a single session of a computerized training in AN, and whether this has short-term effects on eating disorder symptoms. METHOD: Forty inpatients (22.20 +/- 7.15 years) with AN were randomly assigned to receive a single session of computerized training of ERA (TERA) or a sham training (training the recognition of different types of clouds). ERA, self-reported eating disorder symptoms, and body mass index (BMI) were assessed within 3 days before and after training. RESULTS: After training, both groups showed improved ERA, reduced self-reported eating disorder symptoms, and an increased BMI. As compared to patients in the control group, patients who received TERA showed greater improvements in ERA and self-reported eating disorder symptoms. DISCUSSION: ERA can be effectively trained in patients with AN. Moreover, short-term improvements in self-reported eating disorder symptoms provide tentative support for the hypothesis that difficulties in ERA contribute to the maintenance of AN, and that specific trainings of ERA hold promise as an additional component in AN treatment. Future studies are needed to replicate these findings in larger samples, and to investigate long-term effects and transfer into real-world settings.",2020,Jun,Int J Eat Disord,53,6,945-953,32277519.0,10.1002/eat.23276,,#1367,Preis 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
On the Relationship of Interoceptive Accuracy and Attention: A Controlled Study With Depressed Inpatients and a Healthy Cohort,"Schultchen, D.; Schneider, C.; Berberich, G.; Zaudig, M.; Erle, T. M.; Pollatos, O.","OBJECTIVE: Previous research has shown reduced interoceptive accuracy (IAcc) in depression. Attention deficit represents a key symptom of depression. Moreover, IAcc is positively correlated with attention. There is no study that investigates the effect of depression on IAcc and attention. The aim of this study is to examine the mediating effect of IAcc on depression and attention. METHODS: Thirty-six depressed patients from the Psychosomatic Clinic in Windach were matched with 36 healthy controls according to age and sex and were assessed at Ulm University. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the heartbeat perception task to examine IAcc, and the d2 test assessing selective attention. RESULTS: Depressed patients showed attention deficits-both for general visual attention and IAcc-compared to healthy controls. The mediation analyses revealed that the relationship between depression and attention is not mediated via IAcc. Furthermore, depression predicts IAcc and attention, but these effects are direct and largely unaffected by the respective other variable. DISCUSSION: The results of the present study highlight both interoceptive as well as attention deficits in depressed patients. No clear mediation between these variables could be shown in this study. More elaborative research is needed to clarify whether different approaches to improve IAcc are effective for these deficits in depressed patients and could therefore be of importance as an additional aspect of therapy in depression.",2020,2021/02/01,Front Psychol,11,,597488,33597903.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.597488,,#1368,Schultchen 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Negative Mood Increases Selective Attention to Negatively Valenced Body Parts in Female Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa,"Svaldi, J.; Bender, C.; Caffier, D.; Ivanova, V.; Mies, N.; Fleischhaker, C.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.","OBJECTIVE: Previous research has yielded evidence of increased attentional processing of negatively valenced body parts in women with anorexia nervosa (AN), especially for those with high depressive symptomatology. The present study extended previous research by implementing an experimental mood manipulation. METHOD: In a within-subjects design, female adolescents with AN (n = 12) and an age matched female control group (CG; n = 12) were given a negative and a positive mood induction at a one-week interval. After each mood induction, participants underwent a 3-min mirror exposure, while their eye movements were recorded. RESULTS: After the positive mood induction, both AN and CG participants displayed longer and more frequent gazes towards their self-defined most ugly relative to their self-defined most beautiful body part. However, after the negative mood induction, only females with AN were characterized by increased attention to their most ugly compared to their most beautiful body part, while CG participants' attention distribution was balanced. Furthermore, in the negative (but not in the positive) mood induction condition gaze frequency and duration towards the most ugly body part was significantly stronger in the AN group relative to the CG. DISCUSSION: The results emphasize the role of negative mood in the maintenance of pathological information processing of the self-body.

A mania-related memory bias is associated with risk for relapse in bipolar disorder<sup/>,"Meyer, T. D.; Hautzinger, M.; Bauer, I. E.","OBJECTIVE: Previous work has shown that neuropsychological performance can predict outcome of psychotherapy. The present paper explores whether an affective bias in verbal memory is associated with recurrence of mood episodes in patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD). METHOD: 76 euthymic adult patients with BD were randomly assigned to either 9 months of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Support Therapy (ST), and followed up for 2 years after completing therapy. At baseline, affective learning memory (Emotional Auditory Verbal Learning Test; EMO-AVLT) and other measures were assessed. Recurrence of a mood episode was the primary outcome. RESULTS: The survival analyses revealed that the interaction between therapy condition, more specifically ST, and a recognition bias in favor of mania-related, but not depression-related words predicted recurrence of mania. Recurrence of depression was predicted by neither affective memory bias nor their interaction with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A mania-related memory bias emerged as a predictor of mania recurrence, specifically in an unstructured setting such as ST. Perhaps mania-related schemata are more salient or more easily activated in those at high risk for recurrence. Interventions targeting patients' insight into their internal states as potential indicators of prodromal manic symptoms could be the key to improve the outcome of psychological interventions in BD.

Relative-risk- and correlation-analysis was used to identify factors associated with problem-drinking and regular heavy-drinking. Independent t-tests compared impulsivity and personality traits, chi-square-tests compared drinking motives between risk- and non-risk-drinkers. RESULTS: Male gender, tobacco-smoking, illegal substance use, impulsivity and various sociodemographic and psychosocial variables were significantly related to problem/heavy-drinking. Extraversion was a risk, conscientiousness and agreeableness were protective factors. Drinking-motives did not differ significantly between risk- and non-risk-drinkers. Generally, the main drinking-motives were to feel elated, relax and social purposes.

Comparison of gut-directed hypnotherapy and unspecific hypnotherapy as self-help format in children and adolescents with functional abdominal pain or irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized pilot study,"Gulewitsch, M. D.; Schlarb, A. A.","OBJECTIVE: Psychosocial treatments for chronic abdominal pain in childhood or adolescence are effective, but time consuming and hardly available. In the present study, gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDHT) and unspecific hypnotherapy (UHT) were compared to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a hypnotherapeutic self-help intervention. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Children/adolescents between 6 and 17 years of age with chronic abdominal pain were randomized to GDHT or UHT. The treatment period was 12 weeks each. Measurements were performed before and after treatment. The primary outcome was a pain diary. Analysis was carried out as per protocol. RESULTS: Of 45 participants included, 13 were lost to follow-up. Thirty-two participants (14 GHDT, 18 UHT) were analyzed. Dropouts had higher pain severity. Completers in both conditions showed good adherence and a similar decrease in days with pain and pain duration. Pain intensity decreased only in the UHT condition. Eleven participants (two GDHT, nine UHT) achieved clinical remission (>80% improvement) and 13 participants (seven GDHT, six UHT) improved significantly (30-80%). CONCLUSION: Results suggest a high efficacy of standardized home-based hypnotherapy for children/adolescents with abdominal pain. Children/adolescents with high pain severity are at risk of dropping out. The UHT condition showed slight evidence of superiority, but conditions were equivalent on most outcomes.

Reduced emotion recognition from nonverbal cues in anorexia nervosa,"Blomberg, M.; Schlegel, K.; Stoll, L.; Febry, H.; Wunsch-Leiteritz, W.; Leiteritz, A.; Brockmeyer, T.","OBJECTIVE: Recent models of anorexia nervosa (AN) emphasise the role of reduced emotion recognition ability (ERA) in the development and maintenance of the disorder. However, methodological limitations impede conclusions from prior research. The current study tries to overcome these limitations by examining ERA with an audio-visual measure that focuses strictly on multimodal nonverbal cues and allows to differentiate between ERA for different emotion categories. METHOD: Forty women with AN and 40 healthy women completed the Geneva Emotion Recognition Test. This test includes 83 video clips in which 10 actors express 14 different emotions while saying a pseudo-linguistic sentence without semantic meaning. All clips contain multimodal nonverbal cues (i.e., prosody, facial expression, gestures, and posture). RESULTS: Patients with AN showed poorer ERA than the healthy control group (d = 0.71), particularly regarding emotions of negative valence (d = 0.26). Furthermore, a lower body weight (r = 0.41) and longer illness duration (rho = -0.32) were associated with poorer ERA in the AN group. CONCLUSIONS: Using an ecologically valid instrument, the findings of the study support illness models emphasising poor ERA in AN.

METHOD: We used growth mixture modeling to identify different latent classes of early change in patients with panic disorder (N = 326) who underwent a manualized cognitive-behavioral treatment. RESULTS: Four latent subgroups were identified, showing clusters of change trajectories over the first 5 sessions. One of the subgroups consisted of patients whose symptoms rapidly decreased and also showed the best outcomes. This information improved treatment prediction by 16.1% over patient intake characteristics. Early change patterns also significantly predicted patients' early treatment termination. Patient intake characteristics that significantly predicted class membership included functional impairment and separation anxiety.

Drawing from the theoretical framework of the Goal Progress Theory of rumination, we propose that heightened feelings of ""inefficiency"" (i.e., low self-efficacy) in AN might play an important role in these dysfunctional cognitive-affective processes. METHOD: Thirty-two weight-recovered participants with a history of AN and 32 healthy control participants filled out questionnaires regarding rumination and affect six times a day over a period of 2 weeks via ecological momentary assessment in real-life. RESULTS: Analyses via hierarchical as well as conceptual process modeling suggest that while inefficiency is generally associated with more rumination and negative affect, additional amplifying mechanisms between these variables exist specifically in recovered participants with a history of AN.

Though both have been associated with an attentional bias for food cues, in prior research restraint and BMI were often confounded. The aim of the present study was to determine the existence and nature of an attention bias for food cues in healthy-weight female restrained and unrestrained eaters, when matching the two groups on BMI. METHOD: Attention biases for food cues were measured by recordings of eye movements during a visual probe task with pictorial food versus non-food stimuli. Healthy weight high restrained (n = 24) and low restrained eaters (n = 21) were matched on BMI in an attempt to unconfound the effects of restraint and weight on attention allocation patterns. RESULTS: All participants showed elevated attention biases for food stimuli in comparison to neutral stimuli, independent of restraint status.

Impact of an Acceptance Facilitating Intervention on Patients' Acceptance of Internet-based Pain Interventions: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Baumeister, H.; Seifferth, H.; Lin, J.; Nowoczin, L.; Luking, M.; Ebert, D.","OBJECTIVE: Results from clinical trials indicate that Internet-based psychological pain interventions are effective in treating chronic pain. However, little is known about patients' acceptance of these programs and how to positively influence patients' intention to engage in them. Therefore, the present study aimed (1) to assess patients' acceptance of Internet-based interventions, and (2) to examine whether patients' acceptance can be increased by an acceptance facilitating intervention. METHODS: A total of 104 patients with chronic pain from 2 pain units were randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG) and a no-intervention control group (CG). The IG was shown a short informational video about Internet-based psychological pain interventions before receiving a questionnaire on patients' acceptance of Internet-based psychological pain interventions and predictors of acceptance (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, Internet usage, and Internet anxiety). The CG filled out the questionnaire immediately. Patients' acceptance was measured with a 4-item scale (sum score ranging from 4 to 20). RESULTS: Baseline acceptance of Internet-based interventions was reported as low (sum-score:4-9) by 53.8%, moderate (10 to 15) by 42.3%, and high (16 to 20) by 3.9% of the patients with chronic pain in the CG.

Fostering socio-emotional competencies in children on the autism spectrum using a parent-assisted serious game: A multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Kirst, S.; Diehm, R.; Bogl, K.; Wilde-Etzold, S.; Bach, C.; Noterdaeme, M.; Poustka, L.; Ziegler, M.; Dziobek, I.","OBJECTIVE: Serious games are a promising means of fostering socio-emotional skills in children on the autism spectrum (AS). However, empathy and related constructs have not yet been addressed comprehensively and together with emotion recognition, and there is a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCT) to investigate skill maintenance and the transfer to functional behavior. METHOD: The manualized, parent-assisted serious game Zirkus Empathico (ZE) was tested against an active control group, in a six-week multicenter RCT. Eighty-two children aged 5-10 years on the AS were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and three-month follow-up. Empathy and emotion recognition skills were defined as the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes included measures of emotional awareness, emotion regulation, autism social symptomatology (Social Responsiveness Scale), and subjective therapy goals. RESULTS: Training effects were observed after the intervention for empathy (d = 0.71) and emotion recognition (d = 0.50), but not at follow-up. Moderate effects on emotional awareness, emotion regulation, and autism social symptomatology were indicated by the short and mid-term assessments.

Impaired Early-Response Inhibition in Overweight Females with and without Binge Eating Disorder,"Svaldi, J.; Naumann, E.; Biehl, S.; Schmitz, F.","OBJECTIVE: Several studies report increased reward sensitivity towards food in overweight individuals. By contrast, data is inconclusive with respect to response inhibition in overweight individuals without binge eating disorder (BED). Hence, the latter was addressed in the present study in a group of overweight/obese females with and without BED and a normal-weight control group without eating disorders. METHOD: A group of women with BED (n = 29), a group of overweight women without BED (n = 33) and normal-weight females (n = 30) participated in a pictorial priming paradigm, with food items (relevant primes) and office utensils (neutral primes) and color blobs (neutral primes) as stimuli. Increased response priming effects (i.e. priming with switches between stimulus categories) were taken as indicators of deficient behavioral inhibition. RESULTS: Priming effects for neutral primes were moderate and comparable across all groups. However, primes associated with the food task set lead to increased priming effects in both overweight groups. But, effects were comparable for overweight/obese participants with and without BED.

Pathological spirit possession as a cultural interpretation of trauma-related symptoms,"Hecker, T.; Barnewitz, E.; Stenmark, H.; Iversen, V.","OBJECTIVE: Spirit possession is a phenomenon frequently occurring in war-torn countries. It has been shown to be an idiom of distress entailing dissociative symptoms. However, its association with trauma exposure and trauma-related disorders remains unclear. This study aimed to explore subjective disease models and the relationship between pathological spirit possession and trauma-related disorders in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. METHOD: Seventy-three (formerly) possessed persons (74% female, mean age = 34 years), referred by traditional and spiritual healers, were interviewed about their experiences of pathological spirit possession, trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depressive symptoms, shame and guilt, psychotic symptoms, somatic complaints, and the impairment of psychosocial functioning. RESULTS: The most common disease model for pathological spirit possession was another person having sent the spirit, mostly a family member or a neighbor, out of jealousy or conflict over resources. Significant correlations were found between spirit possession over lifetime and PTSD symptom severity, feelings of shame and guilt, depressive symptoms, somatic complaints, and psychotic symptoms. Spirit possession during the preceding 4 weeks was associated with PTSD symptom severity, impairment of psychosocial functioning, and psychotic symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that pathological spirit possession is a broad explanatory framework for various subjectively unexplainable mental and physical health problems, including but not limited to trauma-related disorders. Understanding pathological spirit possession as a subjective disease model for various mental and physical health problems may help researchers and clinicians to develop culturally sensitive treatment approaches for affected individuals.

Symptom Perception in Pathological Illness Anxiety: Tactile Sensitivity and Bias,"Wolters, C.; Slotta, T.; Ratayczak, J.; Witthoft, M.; Gerlach, A. L.; Pohl, A.","OBJECTIVE: Symptom perception in pathological illness anxiety (PIA) might be biased so that somatic signals are overreported. In the somatic signal detection task (SSDT), performance in detecting weak tactile stimuli gives information on overreporting or underreporting of stimuli. This task has not yet been applied in PIA. METHODS: Participants with PIA (n = 44) and healthy controls (n = 40) underwent two versions of the SSDT in randomized order. In the original version, tactile and auxiliary light-emitting diode (LED) stimuli were each presented in half of the trials. In the adapted version, illness or neutral words were presented alongside tactile stimuli. Participants also conducted a heartbeat mental tracking task. RESULTS: We found significantly higher sensitivity and a more liberal response bias in LED versus no-LED trials, but no significant differences between word types. An interaction effect showed a more pronounced increase of sensitivity from no LED to LED trials in participants with PIA when compared with the adapted SSDT and control group (F(1,76) = 5.34, p = .024, eta2 = 0.066). Heartbeat perception scores did not differ between groups (BF01 of 3.63). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in sensitivity from no LED to LED trials in participants with PIA suggests stronger multisensory integration. Low sensitivity in the adapted SSDT indicates that attentional resources were exhausted by processing word stimuli.

Efficacy of a burn-specific cognitive-behavioral group training,"Seehausen, A.; Ripper, S.; Germann, G.; Hartmann, B.; Wind, G.; Renneberg, B.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed cognitive-behavioral group training, specifically designed for burn patients. METHOD: In a multicenter-study data pre- and post treatment and at 6-month follow-up were obtained from participants of the group program (Intervention group, IG; n=86) and a control group who received treatment as usual (TAU; n=128). Outcome variables of psychological distress, resources and health-related quality of life of both groups were compared using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Up to 6 months after group treatment, the IG reported a substantial decline of general symptom severity as well as posttraumatic stress, whereas the TAU group showed no significant change over time. Optimism increased in the IG after group treatment, but not in the TAU group. Regarding overall quality of life both groups showed a gradual improvement over the three assessment points.

Beside the Geriatric Depression Scale: the WHO-Five Well-being Index as a valid screening tool for depression in nursing homes,"Allgaier, A. K.; Kramer, D.; Saravo, B.; Mergl, R.; Fejtkova, S.; Hegerl, U.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare criterion validities of the WHO-Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item version (GDS-15) and 4-item version (GDS-4) as screening instruments for depression in nursing home residents. METHODS: Data from 92 residents aged 65-97 years without severe cognitive impairment (Mini Mental State Examination >/=15) were analysed. Criterion validities of the WHO-5, the GDS-15 and the GDS-4 were assessed against diagnoses of major and minor depression provided by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Subanalyses were performed for major and minor depression. Areas under the receiver operating curve (AUCs) as well as sensitivities and specificities at optimal cut-off points were computed. RESULTS: Prevalence of depressive disorder was 28.3%. The AUC value of the WHO-5 (0.90) was similar to that of the GDS-15 (0.82). Sensitivity of the WHO-5 (0.92) at its optimal cut-off of </=12 was significantly higher than that of the GDS-15 (0.69) at its optimal cut-off of >/=7. The WHO-5 was equally sensitive for the subgroups of major and minor depression (0.92), whereas the GDS-15 was sensitive only for major depression (0.85), but not for minor depression (0.54). For specificity, there was no significant difference between WHO-5 (0.79) and GDS-15 (0.88), but both instruments outperformed the GDS-4 (0.53). CONCLUSIONS: The WHO-5 demonstrated high sensitivity for major and minor depression. Being shorter than the GDS-15 and superior to the GDS-4, the WHO-5 is a promising screening tool that could help physicians improve low recognition rates of depression in nursing home residents.",2013,Nov,Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,28,11,1197-204,23463576.0,10.1002/gps.3944,,#1389,Allgaier 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Effects of Preoperative Psychological Interventions on Catecholamine and Cortisol Levels After Surgery in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patients: The Randomized Controlled PSY-HEART Trial,"Salzmann, S.; Euteneuer, F.; Laferton, J. A. C.; Auer, C. J.; Shedden-Mora, M. C.; Schedlowski, M.; Moosdorf, R.; Rief, W.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine whether preoperative psychological interventions targeting patients' expectations are capable of influencing the biological stress response after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and could thus improve recovery after heart surgery. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial with assessments 10 days before surgery, after psychological intervention (day of hospital admission, but before surgery), postoperative (6-8 days later), and at follow-up (6 months after surgery). Eligible patients (N = 124) scheduled for elective on-pump CABG or CABG with valve replacement surgery were approached before hospital admission. Standard medical care (SMC) was compared with two additional preoperative psychological interventions: (a) an expectation manipulation intervention to optimize patients' expectations about course and outcomes or (b) supportive therapy, containing the same amount of therapeutic attention, but without specifically focusing on expectations. Postoperative plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, and cortisol levels were a secondary outcome of our study (primary outcome patients' disability 6 months after surgery and other secondary patient-reported or clinical outcomes were reported elsewhere). RESULTS: Expectation manipulation intervention (3.68 ln pg/mL, 95% confidence interval = 3.38-3.98, p = .015) and supportive therapy (3.70 ln pg/mL, 95% confidence interval = 3.38-4.01, p = .026) led to significantly lower postoperative adrenaline levels compared with SMC (4.26 ln pg/mL, 95% confidence interval = 3.99-4.53) only. There were no treatment effects of the preoperative intervention for noradrenaline (p = .90) or cortisol (p = .30). Higher postoperative adrenaline levels predicted disability 6 months after surgery (r = .258, p = .018). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to SMC, preoperative psychological interventions seem to buffer psychobiological stress responses and could thus facilitate recovery from CABG surgery. Patients' postoperative stress responses could be an important factor for explaining trajectories of long-term outcomes.

Efficacy of internet-based treatment for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder: Results of a randomized controlled trial,"Zarski, A. C.; Berking, M.; Ebert, D. D.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based treatment for Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder (GPPPD) which adversely affects women's sexuality and is associated with reduced well-being and mental health comorbidities. METHOD: Two-hundred women with GPPPD (no penetrative intercourse >/=6 months) were randomly allocated to the intervention group (IG) or a waitlist control group (WCG). The intervention included eight modules and one booster session and was delivered through an eHealth platform. Participants were supported by an eCoach regarding treatment adherence. The primary outcome was intercourse penetration behavior. Online assessments were scheduled at baseline (T1), after Session 8/12 weeks (T2), and 6 months (T3) after randomization. Intention-to-treat analyses were reported. RESULTS: Significantly more participants (31.00%, n = 31/100) in the IG were able to have sexual intercourse at T2 compared to those in the WCG, 13.00%, n = 13/100; chi(2)(1) = 9.44, p < .01. At T3, still more participants in the IG had sexual intercourse (29%) compared to those in the WCG (20%) but the groups no longer differed significantly, chi(2)(1) = 2.19, p = .19. Genital pain, painful and noncoital penetration behavior, and negative penetration-related cognitions significantly improved with medium to large effects at T2 (d = 0.66-1.25) and small to large effects at T3 (d = 0.23-1.32), whereas fear of sexuality, overall sexual functioning, trait anxiety, and well-being improved with small to medium effects (T2: d = 0.20-0.49, T3: d = 0.23-0.46) in the IG compared to the WCG.

Emotion regulation in disordered eating: Psychometric properties of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale among Spanish adults and its interrelations with personality and clinical severity,"Wolz, I.; Aguera, Z.; Granero, R.; Jimenez-Murcia, S.; Gratz, K. L.; Menchon, J. M.; Fernandez-Aranda, F.","OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to (1) validate the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) in a sample of Spanish adults with and without eating disorders, and (2) explore the role of emotion regulation difficulties in eating disorders (ED), including its mediating role in the relation between key personality traits and ED severity. METHODS: One hundred and thirty four patients (121 female, mean age = 29 years) with anorexia nervosa (n = 30), bulimia nervosa (n = 54), binge eating (n = 20), or Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (n = 30) and 74 healthy control participants (51 female, mean age = 21 years) reported on general psychopathology, ED severity, personality traits and difficulties in emotion regulation. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine the psychometrics of the DERS in this Spanish sample (Aim 1). Additionally, to examine the role of emotion regulation difficulties in ED (Aim 2), differences in emotion regulation difficulties across eating disorder subgroups were examined and structural equation modeling was used to explore the interrelations among emotion regulation, personality traits, and eating disorder severity. RESULTS: RESULTS support the validity and reliability of the DERS within this Spanish adult sample and suggest that this measure has a similar factor structure in this sample as in the original sample. Moreover, emotion regulation difficulties were found to differ as a function of eating disorder subtype and to mediate the relation between two specific personality traits (i.e., high harm avoidance and low self-directedness) and ED severity.

Methods: A routinely collected data set of 612 PTSD inpatients (M = 42.3 years [SD = 11.6], 75.7% female) having received trauma-focused psychotherapy was analyzed. Primary outcome was the clinical symptom severity change score, secondary outcomes were assessed using functional, anxiety, and depression change scores. Hedges g-corrected pre-post effect sizes (ES) were computed for all outcomes. Elastic net regulation as a data-driven, stability-based machine-learning approach was used to build stable clinical prediction models. Results: Hedges g ES indicated medium to large effects on all outcomes. The results of the predictor analyses suggested that a combined predictor model with sociodemographic, clinical, and psychometric variables contribute to predicting different treatment outcomes. Across the clinical and functional outcome, psychoticism, total number of diagnoses, and bronchial asthma consistently showed a stable negative predictive relationship to treatment outcome.

Social mimicry, the automatic imitation of another person, has been linked to building relationships. This is the first preregistered study to systematically investigate mimicry and its effects on the working alliance in real psychotherapy sessions.Method: Sixty-four different patient-therapist dyads were filmed during a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). By using actor-partner interdependence models, we analyzed the extent to which therapists' and patients' earlier mimicry predicted their own mimicry (actor effect), how they influenced each other in their mimicry (partner effect) and the effects of mimicry on the patients' alliance. Videos of 151 sessions were rated by two observers.Results: Patients showed stable low mimicry levels. Furthermore, the patients' mimicry predicted that of the therapists, indicating that therapists adapt their mimicry levels to patients. Only the patients' but not the therapists' mimicry at the beginning of treatment predicted the patients' alliance.Conclusion: The results suggest that the role of the active patient is underestimated.

Intraindividual dynamics between alliance and symptom severity in long-term psychotherapy: Why time matters,"Volz, M.; Jennissen, S.; Schauenburg, H.; Nikendei, C.; Ehrenthal, J. C.; Dinger, U.","Objective: The association between alliance and therapy outcome is one of the most investigated factors in psychotherapy research. However, even studies using advanced methods estimate effects over a specific time period (interval) between measurement occasions. Thus, it remains unknown how the magnitude and direction of effects depend on the considered time interval, resulting in limited comparability across studies. The current study examines the influence of time on the within-person relationship between alliance and symptom severity. Method: Alliance (WAI-SR) and symptom severity (SCL-K11) were assessed every fifth session in N = 650 patients receiving up to 100 weekly sessions (mode = 55; M = 41.03; SD = 27.23) of individual psychotherapy in a German outpatient clinic. Bivariate continuous-time (CT) structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to estimate within-person cross- and auto-effects. Results: Analysis revealed significant reciprocal within-person cross-effects with stronger relative effects of SCL-K11 on WAI-SR (a(2)(1)) than vice versa (a(1)(2)). CT analysis showed that both cross-lagged effects increased for longer time intervals with strongest effects for time intervals of about 40 sessions (a(2)(1) = -.47; a(1)(2) = -.19). Conclusions: Alliance and symptom severity showed a reciprocal relationship. Expanding current evidence, our analysis showed how the magnitude of these effects depends on the considered time interval. Applying CT-SEM on longitudinal data of the alliance outcome association complements current cross-lagged panel analysis and allows to compare results of studies which are based on different time intervals between measurement occasions.

Session-to-session effects of alliance ruptures in outpatient CBT: Within- and between-patient associations,"Rubel, J. A.; Zilcha-Mano, S.; Feils-Klaus, V.; Lutz, W.","OBJECTIVE: The concept of alliance ruptures has had a large impact on contemporary studies of the alliance. Although this debate mainly focuses on the effect of ruptures and repairs on subsequent alliance and outcome levels within patients, to date no study has actually examined these within-patient effects. The present study fills this lacuna by examining the effect of alliance ruptures and in-session repairs on alliance ratings and symptom impairment in the subsequent session, accounting for the temporal sequence of ruptures and symptom impairment. METHOD: Ruptures and in-session repairs were rated by 1,210 patients and 147 therapists using a postsession questionnaire (PSQ-P/-T). Alliance was assessed with the Bern postsession reports and symptomatic impairment with the Hopkins symptom checklist, short form. RESULTS: Patient- and therapist-reported ruptures were significant predictors of subsequent alliance and symptom impairment. While sessions in which both patient and therapist perceived a rupture were especially detrimental for next session symptom distress, they were less damaging to next session alliance levels than sessions in which either only the patient or the therapist experienced the rupture. Neither the intensity of the rupture nor the perceived level of in-session repair were associated with next-session fluctuations in symptom or alliance levels within-patient. CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate the importance of disentangling between- and within-patient rupture and in-session repair processes to better understand the roles of rupture and repair in treatment.

Chocolate consumption, changes in craving and search time for hidden chocolates were assessed. Eye-movement recordings were used to monitor the accuracy during the experimental attention modification task as possible moderator of effects. Regression analyses were conducted to test the effect of attention modification and modification accuracy on chocolate intake, craving and motivation to search for hidden chocolates. RESULTS: Results showed that participants with higher accuracy (+1 SD), ate more chocolate when they had to attend to chocolate and ate less chocolate when they had to attend to non-food stimuli. In contrast, for participants with lower accuracy (-1 SD), the results were exactly reversed. No effects of the experimental attention modification on craving or search time for hidden chocolates were found.

Habituation effects of pleasant and unpleasant odors,"Croy, I.; Maboshe, W.; Hummel, T.","OBJECTIVE: The hedonic value of odors is reflected in chemosensory evoked potentials with more salient unpleasant odors being processed differently from pleasant odors. However, it is not known if this effect is stable over time. It was examined if chemosensory evoked potentials towards pleasant and unpleasant odors change with repeated presentation. METHODS: 42 participants received two pleasant (Peach and PEA) and one unpleasant (H2S) intensity matched odors in a block design. Intensity and pleasantness were rated after each presentation. Subjective ratings, as well as N1 and P2 of the first stimulus of each block were compared with the two following stimuli of each block. RESULTS: Early and late components of the chemosensory evoked potentials had shorter latencies in response to the unpleasant H2S compared to PEA and Peach. Pleasantness ratings for H2S increased with repeated presentation but were far below neutral even for the third stimulus in a row. In line with this, for H2S only, the P2 amplitude diminished with repeated presentation. CONCLUSION: We assume that unpleasant stimuli catch more attention first hand.

More specifically, better alliance scores in one session were followed by more coping experiences in the subsequent session. With regard to anxiety symptoms, an association was found only with the working alliance total score as well as for the bonds component, but not for the goals and task components of the working alliance. The priming condition (resource priming vs. adherence priming) had no influence on the within-patient alliance-outcome association. Between-patient alliance associations were only present with coping experiences, but not with anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSION: The findings provide further empirical evidence for the hypothesis that the working alliance may be a robust facilitative factor for change in CBT treatments for generalized anxiety disorder, which evolves irrespective of the strictness with which therapists adhere to the treatment manual.

Placebo- and Nocebo-Effects in Cognitive Neuroenhancement: When Expectation Shapes Perception,"Winkler, A.; Hermann, C.","Objective: The number of students using prescription drugs to improve cognitive performance has increased within the last years. There is first evidence that the expectation to receive a performance-enhancing drug alone can result in improved perceived and actual cognitive performance, suggesting a substantial placebo effect. In addition, expecting a placebo can result in lower perceived and actual cognitive performance, suggesting a nocebo effect. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of these effects remain to be elucidated. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the expectation of receiving a performance-increasing drug or a performance-impairing drug leads to changes in actual and perceived cognitive performance, compared to a control group without expectation manipulation. Methods: A total of N = 75 healthy adults were recruited for an experiment to ""try cognitive performance-modulating drugs."" A participant's actual cognitive performance (alertness, working memory, sustained attention, and divided attention) using the standardized test of attentional performance (TAP) as well as their performance expectation were assessed. Participants were randomly assigned in equal numbers to either receiving a placebo performance increasing nasal spray (""Modafinil"") or a nocebo performance impairing nasal spray (""Vividrin((R))"") or no nasal spray (natural history). After placebo/nocebo nasal spray administration, cognitive performance was reassessed. Subsequent to the second assessment, participants rated their perceived change in cognitive performance, as well as adverse symptoms. Results: Unlike hypothesized, a positive or negative performance expectation did not result in changes in actual performance, corresponding to the induced expectation. Participants in the placebo-Modafinil group rated their perceived change in cognitive performance subsequent to the application of the nasal spray significantly better (d = 1.16) compared to the nocebo-Vividrin((R)) group. Additionally, participants who expected to receive Modafinil felt less tired than participants in the Vividrin((R)) group (d = 0.96). Conclusion: Manipulation of performance expectation affects the perceived change in performance and tiredness, but not the actual cognitive performance in healthy adults. This may explain why college students use such drugs despite their little impact on actual cognitive functioning.",2019,2019/07/12,Front Psychiatry,10,,498,31354552.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00498,,#1412,Winkler 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Assessment of ADHD Symptoms and the Issue of Cultural Variation: Are Conners 3 Rating Scales Applicable to Children and Parents With Migration Background?,"Schmidt, M.; Reh, V.; Hirsch, O.; Rief, W.; Christiansen, H.","OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate whether Conners 3 ( Conners 3rd edition) ratings of ADHD symptoms are robust to distortion by cultural variation when applied to children with migration background living in Germany. METHOD: From 2010 to 2011, Conners 3 data (self-rating, parent rating, and teacher rating) of 243 children with Turkish migration background, aged 6 to 16 years, were collected in various German schools. Allocation of items to latent factors was tested with confirmatory analyses. Reliability and validity of resulting factors was calculated and influence of acculturation, gender, and age on rating-modalities was examined. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses showed high model fits for all rating-modalities. Resulting scales had good reliability and validity. There was a small influence of acculturation on parent ratings of oppositional defiant disorder but not on ADHD core symptoms.

Individual differences in response to once versus twice weekly sessions of CBT and IPT for depression,"Bruijniks, S. J. E.; van Bronswijk, S. C.; DeRubeis, R. J.; Delgadillo, J.; Cuijpers, P.; Huibers, M. J. H.","OBJECTIVE: The Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) is a method to guide treatment selection by investigating which of two or more treatments is optimal for a given individual. Recently, it was shown that, on average, twice-weekly sessions of psychotherapy for depression lead to better outcomes compared to once-weekly sessions. The present study applied the PAI method to assess if subgroups of patients may have a differential response to psychotherapy frequency. METHOD: Data came from a clinical trial (n = 200) randomizing depressed patients into different session frequencies: weekly sessions versus twice-weekly sessions. Machine-learning techniques were used to select pretreatment variables and develop a multivariable prediction model that calculated each patient's PAI. Differences in observed depression post-treatment scores (Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II]) were tested between patients that received their PAI-indicated versus non-indicated session frequency. Between-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) were reported. RESULTS: We identified prognostic indicators generally associated with lower post-treatment BDI-II regardless of treatment assignment. In addition, we identified specific demographic and psychometric features associated with differential response to weekly- versus twice-weekly therapy sessions. Observed post-treatment BDI-II scores were significantly different between individuals receiving the PAI-indicated versus non-indicated session frequency (d = .37). CONCLUSIONS: Although a higher session frequency is more effective on average, different session frequencies seem beneficial for different patients. Future studies should externally validate these findings before they can be generalized to other settings.

Change in avoidance and negative grief-related cognitions mediates treatment outcome in older adults with prolonged grief disorder,"Lechner-Meichsner, F.; Mauro, C.; Skritskaya, N. A.; Shear, M. K.","Objective: The present study investigated the role of the two theoretically derived mediators in the treatment of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD). Mediators were changes in avoidance and maladaptive cognitions. An additional hypothesis tested whether these candidate mediators are specific to CBT-based Complicated Grief Treatment (CGT) compared to Interpersonal Therapy (IPT). Method: We performed secondary analyses with assessment completers (n = 131) from a randomized-controlled trial with older adults with PGD. Patients received 16 sessions of CGT or IPT. Outcomes were treatment response and reductions in grief symptoms and grief-related related impairment. Results: Reductions in avoidance between baseline and week 16 mediated reductions in grief symptoms and grief-related impairment. Reductions in maladaptive grief-related cognitions over the same period mediated treatment response, reductions in grief symptoms and grief-related impairment. There were no significant treatment-mediator interactions. We could not establish that mediators changed before the outcomes. Conclusion: Results are consistent with theoretical models of PGD, including the CGT treatment model. Despite different therapeutic procedures, we found no significant interaction effect, but CGT produced larger effects. Future research needs to establish a timeline of change through the use of multiple measurements of mediators and outcomes.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01244295.",2022,Jan,Psychother Res,32,1,91-103,33818302.0,10.1080/10503307.2021.1909769,,#1415,Lechner-Meichsner 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Congruence of therapeutic bond perceptions and its relation to treatment outcome: Within- and between-dyad effects,"Rubel, J. A.; Bar-Kalifa, E.; Atzil-Slonim, D.; Schmidt, S.; Lutz, W.","OBJECTIVE: The present study investigates the association between congruence of patients' and therapists' perceptions of the therapeutic bond and symptom improvement. METHOD: Bond congruence-outcome associations were examined on the within- and between-dyad level for 580 patients (mainly depression and anxiety) receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy. Symptom change was assessed on a session-to-session level as well as from pre- to posttreatment. For the between-dyad analyses, the truth and bias model was applied. For the within-dyad analyses, polynomial regression and response surface analysis were conducted. RESULTS: On the between-dyad level, higher temporal congruence between patients' and therapists' bond ratings (i.e., their correlation) was associated with better treatment outcomes. Additionally, the average discrepancy between therapists' and patients' bond ratings showed a significant quadratic association with treatment outcome. A tendency for therapists to moderately rate the bond lower than their patients' showed lowest posttreatment symptom scores. On the within-dyad level, we found that when patients' and therapists' ratings were in ""agreement,"" higher bond scores were associated with fewer next-session symptoms. For ""disagreement,"" the results showed that if therapists rated the bond as weak, whereas their patients rated it as strong, higher subsequent symptom distress was observed than if patients rated the bond as weak and their therapists rated it as strong. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the importance of therapists being vigilant to session-to-session changes in the therapeutic bond to adjust their interventions accordingly.

"Weight, shape, and muscularity concerns in male and female adolescents: Predictors of change and influences on eating concern","Hoffmann, S.; Warschburger, P.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of age and weight status on adolescents' body dissatisfaction and its change over 20 months in a gender-comparing design. The influence of body image concern on eating concern was also investigated. METHOD: In a prospective study, 675 male and female adolescents aged 12-16 were assessed using self-report questionnaires on weight, shape, muscularity, and eating concerns. Height and weight measurements were taken by trained personnel. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Analyses of latent means revealed more pronounced weight/shape concern in females than males and more pronounced muscularity concern in males than females. Weight/shape concern increased in females over time, whereas muscularity concern remained stable in both genders. Baseline levels of weight/shape concern could be predicted by age and weight status in females and by weight status in males. The only predictor of change in weight/shape concern was weight status in males. Baseline levels of muscularity concern could be predicted by age in females and by weight status in males. Similar effects were found for changes in muscularity concern in both genders. Increases in weight/shape and muscularity concern were associated with more pronounced eating concern. DISCUSSION: The results confirm gender differences in distinctive facets of body image concern and its prediction. The relevance of increase in body image concern in adolescents is underlined by its association with eating concern in both genders. Further explanatory variables for change in body dissatisfaction should be examined in future studies.

Patterns of change and their relationship to outcome and follow-up in group and individual psychotherapy for depression,"Moggia, D.; Lutz, W.; Arndt, A.; Feixas, G.","OBJECTIVE: The study explored the presence of different patterns of change in a sample of patients who received cognitive therapy for depression sequentially in two different formats: group and individual. Our hypothesis was that patients' baseline characteristics (e.g., symptom severity, self-esteem) would discriminate patterns of response to group and individual therapy. METHOD: 108 adults who met criteria for depression and completed the treatments included in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Clinical Outcome in Routine Evaluation-Short Form B (CORE-SFB), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), and the repertory grid technique. Growth mixture modeling was carried out to identify the patterns of change. Mixed linear models and repeated measures analysis of variance were performed to compare patients' characteristics in each pattern. Multinomial logistic regression was used to compute predictive models for the patterns from patients' characteristics. Finally, hierarchical linear regression was used to establish the power of each pattern to predict treatment outcome. RESULTS: A 3-class solution was obtained: group therapy improvers, individual therapy improvers, and nonimprovers. Group therapy improvers started therapy with less severe levels of depression and psychological distress, higher functioning and self-esteem, lower perceived social isolation, and lower dilemmatic construction of the self than the other groups. Individual therapy improvers and nonimprovers presented similar characteristics at baseline. However, a significant proportion of nonimprovers presented a concurrent diagnosis of fibromyalgia. CONCLUSION: The greater the impairment that patients present at baseline, the more likely they are to benefit from individual therapy after group therapy. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia can be considered a risk factor for therapy failure in the treatment of depression.

METHOD: A novel design for individual psychotherapy studies was adopted, a many-with-many asymmetrical block dyadic design, in which several patients interact with several therapists. Hierarchical linear models were computed to study through variance partitioning the different components of the SRM and their association to treatment outcome. RESULTS: All SRM components (with significant effects at therapist- and patient- within and between levels) resulted in significant contributions to the bond. However, only components at the within- and between-therapist, and within-patient levels resulted in significant associations with outcome.

METHODS: Sample size was 2.469, with 51% taking any medication. Participants answered the Somatosensory Amplification Scale, Generic Assessment of Side Effects Scale, and indicated whether they were taking any medication and the type of medication. Correlational analysis and binary logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: When examining a subsample reporting both medication intake and general bodily symptoms, participants higher in somatosensory amplification rated more of their general bodily symptoms as medication-attributed side effects. However, somatosensory amplification scores were not associated with the intake of any type of medication. In the overall sample, higher somatosensory amplification scores were associated with an increased report of bodily symptoms. Additionally, participants with higher somatosensory amplification reported intake of a greater number of different medications.

METHOD: The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), a parent rating scale of disruptive behaviors, was completed on 310 children (2-11 years) at three child and adolescent psychiatry clinics in three German states (Bavaria, Hesse, Lower Saxony); the majority of children were outpatients. RESULTS: Mean intensity scores of disruptive behaviors differed significantly by diagnostic group, with the lowest ratings within a community sample, and increasingly higher scores in children with a diagnosis from the internalizing spectrum, those with pervasive developmental disorders, and finally, those with externalizing disorders (e. g. hyperkinetic disorder, conduct disorders). Seventy percent of the clinical sample, compared to only 17 % of the community sample, exceeded the normative cut-off score of 111, indicating that disruptive behaviors are common in young German children seeking help for different mental health problems.

DESIGN: Our sample comprised 348 patients (mean age = 40 years; 68% female; 133 patients with depression, 122 patients with somatoform disorders, and 93 patients with eating disorders). METHODS: Patients completed the Working Alliance Inventory and measures of therapeutic outcome in early, middle, and late stages of inpatient psychotherapy. We applied multivariate multilevel models to address the nested data structure. RESULTS: All three disorder groups experienced positive alliances that increased across the course of therapy and showed similar alliance-outcome relations that were of comparable strengths as in current meta-analyses. However, we found perspective incongruence of alliance ratings from patient and therapist in the three disorder groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results generally indicate that the working alliance is of importance irrespective of the specific mental disorder. Perspective incongruence feedback of working alliance experiences could help to strengthen coordination between patient and therapist and thereby improve the therapeutic process. Further implications of these findings are discussed. PRACTITIONER POINTS: We found no differences in the strengths of alliance ratings and alliance-outcome associations in depressive, somatoform, and eating disorder patients. This indicates that the working alliance is of general clinical importance irrespective of the disorder group and should be a central target in all therapies.

Within and between associations of clinical microskills and correct application of techniques/strategies: A longitudinal multilevel approach,"Uhl, J.; Schaffrath, J.; Schwartz, B.; Poster, K.; Lutz, W.","OBJECTIVE: The therapist effect has been demonstrated in various studies. However, studies on putative therapist characteristics show heterogeneous results. Although the majority of studies have solely examined effects between therapists, a growing interest in effects within therapists has emerged. However, it remains unclear whether therapist characteristics are rather a state-like than a trait-like phenomenon. The main aim of the present study is to test whether clinical microskills as well as correct application of techniques and strategies (both between and within therapists) predict across-session change of symptom severity in a large naturalistic data set. METHOD: The results are based on 398 patients and 48 therapists who treated 5-17 patients each. Clinical microskills and correct application of techniques/strategies were rated using the Inventory of Therapeutic Interventions and Skills, and symptom severity was assessed with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-11. RESULTS: Results demonstrated significant within- and between-therapist variability in clinical microskills and correct application of techniques/strategies, and no change over the course of treatment in both variables. Moreover, correct application of techniques/strategies was significantly associated with symptom improvement within, but not between therapists. In addition, higher treatment difficulty as well as an interaction between treatment difficulty and correct application of techniques/strategies were significantly associated with symptom improvement. Clinical microskills were neither predictive of symptom improvement within nor between therapists.

Children of mentally ill parents-a pilot study of a group intervention program,"Christiansen, H.; Anding, J.; Schrott, B.; Rohrle, B.","OBJECTIVE: The transgenerational transmission of mental disorders is one of the most prominent risk factors for the development of psychological disorders. Children of mentally ill parents are a vulnerable high risk group with overall impaired development and high rates of psychological disorders. To date there are only a few evidence based intervention programs for this group overall and hardly any in Germany. We translated the evidence based Family Talk Intervention by Beardslee (2009) and adapted it for groups. First results of this pilot study are presented. METHOD: This investigation evaluates a preventive group intervention for children of mentally ill parents. In a quasi-experimental design three groups are compared: an intervention group (Family Talk Intervention group: n = 28), a Wait Control group (n = 9), and a control group of healthy children (n = 40). Mean age of children was 10.41 years and parental disorders were mostly depressive/affective disorders (n = 30), but a small number also presented with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (n = 7). RESULTS: Children of mentally ill parents showed higher rates of internalizing/externalizing disorders before and after the intervention compared to children of parents with no disorders. Post intervention children's knowledge on mental disorders was significantly enhanced in the Family Talk Intervention group compared to the Wait Control group and the healthy control group. Parental ratings of externalizing symptoms in the children were reduced to normal levels after the intervention in the Family Talk Intervention group, but not in the Wait Control group.

Visual processing of one's own body over the course of time: Evidence for the vigilance-avoidance theory in adolescents with anorexia nervosa?,"Bauer, A.; Schneider, S.; Waldorf, M.; Cordes, M.; Huber, T. J.; Braks, K.; Vocks, S.","OBJECTIVE: The vigilance-avoidance theory postulates a specific threat-related pattern of attention deployment, characterized by initial orientation towards fear-evoking stimuli and subsequent directing of attention away from them. The current eye-tracking study was the first to examine the applicability of the theory for patients with eating disorders, who perceive their own body as a highly aversive, threat-evoking stimulus. METHOD: N = 56 female adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) and n = 43 healthy controls (HC) aged 13-18 viewed own-body pictures while their eye movements were recorded. Relative fixation times on self-defined unattractive body areas were compared between the groups by sequencing the overall presentation time of 6,000 ms into six intervals a 1,000 ms. RESULTS: Participants with AN showed a significantly stronger attentional bias for unattractive body areas than HC within the time intervals 1, 2, and 3. However, for intervals 4, 5, and 6, no significant group differences occurred. Within the AN group, the bias for unattractive body areas was significantly stronger in interval 1 compared to intervals 4, 5, and 6; whereas within the HC group, a stable pattern of attention deployment emerged. In AN, early attention deployment was positively correlated with the negative affect reported after photo presentation.

Effects of competence feedback on therapist competence and patient outcome: A randomized controlled trial,"Weck, F.; Junga, Y. M.; Kliegl, R.; Hahn, D.; Brucker, K.; Witthoft, M.","OBJECTIVE: Therapist competence is considered essential for the success of psychotherapy. Feedback is an intervention which has the potential to improve therapist competence. The present study investigated whether competence feedback leads to an improvement of therapist competence and patient outcome. METHOD: Sixty-seven master-level clinical trainees were randomly assigned to either a competence feedback group (CFG) or a control group (CG). Patients with a diagnosis of major depression (N = 114) were randomly assigned to CFG or CG. Treatment included 20 individual sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In CFG, therapists received, parallel to the treatment, five competence feedbacks, based on videotaped therapy sessions. Independent raters assessed therapist competence with the Cognitive Therapy Scale (CTS) and provided the competence feedback. Patient outcome was evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and therapeutic alliance (Helping Alliance Questionnaire [HAQ]) from both therapist's (HAQ-T) and patient's (HAQ-P) perspective were evaluated after each of the 20 sessions. RESULTS: (a) Therapist competence (CTS) increased significantly more for CFG than CG. (b) Depression (BDI-II) decreased significantly across sessions for both groups, but without evidence for a group-differential benefit for the CFG. (c) Therapeutic alliance (HAQ-T/P) increased significantly across sessions for both groups from both perspectives, but without group differences.

The concise measurement of clinical communication skills: Validation of a short scale,"Maass, U.; Kuhne, F.; Heinze, P. E.; Ay-Bryson, D. S.; Weck, F.","OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of brief rating scales for the reliable assessment of psychotherapeutic skills, which do not require intensive rater training and/or a high level of expertise. Thus, the objective is to validate a 14-item version of the Clinical Communication Skills Scale (CCSS-S). METHODS: Using a sample of N = 690 video-based ratings of role-plays with simulated patients, we calculated a confirmatory factor analysis and an exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), assessed convergent validities, determined inter-rater reliabilities and compared these with those who were either psychology students, advanced psychotherapy trainees, or experts. RESULTS: Correlations with other competence rating scales were high (rs > 0.86-0.89). The intraclass correlations ranged between moderate and good [ICC((2,2)) = 0.65-0.80], with student raters yielding the lowest scores. The one-factor model only marginally replicated the data, but the internal consistencies were excellent (alpha = 0.91-95). The ESEM yielded a two-factor solution (Collaboration and Structuring and Exploration Skills). CONCLUSION: The CCSS-S is a brief and valid rating scale that reliably assesses basic communication skills, which is particularly useful for psychotherapy training using standardized role-plays. To ensure good inter-rater reliabilities, it is still advisable to employ raters with at least some clinical experience.

Exploring change in cognitive-behavioral therapy for generalized anxiety disorder-A two-arms ABAB crossed-therapist randomized clinical implementation trial,"Fluckiger, C.; Visla, A.; Wolfer, C.; Hilpert, P.; Zinbarg, R. E.; Lutz, W.; Grosse Holtforth, M.; Allemand, M.","OBJECTIVE: There is little evidence-based knowledge of how psychotherapists should handle both sudden gains and more gradual session-by-session changes, either in general or in individuals suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. METHODS: Using an ABAB crossed-therapist randomized clinical implementation trial design (N = 80 patients and 20 therapists), we contrasted a Prolonged Focus on Change (PFC, N = 40) implementation with a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA, N = 40) implementation. Both implementations were based on a widely used cognitive behavioral therapy approach (Mastery of your Anxiety and Worry package) with the only difference that in the PFC implementation, the therapists were instructed to systematically explore eventual changes at the beginning of the therapy sessions. RESULTS: Based on a 3-level hierarchical linear model, PFC implementation showed faster symptom reduction in worry over therapy (i.e., linear change) and a decelerated (quadratic) change until 12-month follow-up in comparison to the SOTA implementation. CONCLUSION: These findings provide clinically useful information about potential short-term and long-term effects of exploring occurring change in GAD populations. Randomized clinical implementation trial designs are a step forward allowing to experimentally investigate basic psychotherapeutic strategies in process-based psychotherapy.

Vicarious resilience in sexual assault and domestic violence advocates,"Frey, L. L.; Beesley, D.; Abbott, D.; Kendrick, E.","OBJECTIVE: There is little research related to sexual assault and domestic violence advocates' experiences, with the bulk of the literature focused on stressors and systemic barriers that negatively impact efforts to assist survivors. However, advocates participating in these studies have also emphasized the positive impact they experience consequent to their work. This study explores the positive impact. METHOD: Vicarious resilience, personal trauma experiences, peer relational quality, and perceived organizational support in advocates (n = 222) are examined. Also, overlap among the conceptual components of vicarious resilience is explored. RESULTS: The first set of multiple regressions showed that personal trauma experiences and peer relational health predicted compassion satisfaction and vicarious posttraumatic growth, with organizational support predicting only compassion satisfaction. The second set of multiple regressions showed that (a) there was significant shared variance between vicarious posttraumatic growth and compassion satisfaction; (b) after accounting for vicarious posttraumatic growth, organizational support accounted for significant variance in compassion satisfaction; and (c) after accounting for compassion satisfaction, peer relational health accounted for significant variance in vicarious posttraumatic growth. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that it may be more meaningful to conceptualize advocates' personal growth related to their work through the lens of a multidimensional construct such as vicarious resilience. Organizational strategies promoting vicarious resilience (e.g., shared organizational power, training components) are offered, and the value to trauma-informed care of fostering advocates' vicarious resilience is discussed.

As many practitioners integrate mindfulness exercises into individual therapy, empirical evidence is of high clinical relevance. METHOD: We investigated the effects of a session-introducing intervention with mindfulness elements (SIIME) in a randomized, controlled design. The effects of SIIME on therapeutic alliance and symptomatic outcome were compared with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and treatment-as-usual (TAU) control conditions. The sample comprised 162 patients with anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling revealed a significant symptom reduction and significant increase of alliance over the course of therapy. There were no significant time-condition interactions on outcome and alliance, indicating the comparable efficiency of all three treatment conditions.

Test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change of the dimensional anxiety scales for DSM-5,"Knappe, S.; Klotsche, J.; Heyde, F.; Hiob, S.; Siegert, J.; Hoyer, J.; Strobel, A.; LeBeau, R. T.; Craske, M. G.; Wittchen, H.

METHODS: The German versions of the dimensional anxiety scales were administered to 218 students followed up approximately 2 weeks later (Study 1) and 55 outpatients (23 with anxiety diagnoses) followed-up 1 year later (Study 2). Probable diagnostic status in students was determined by the DIA-X/M-CIDI stem screening-questionnaire (SSQ). In the clinical sample, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses were assessed at Time 1 using the DIA-X/M-CIDI. At Time 2, the patient-version of the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) was applied to assess change. RESULTS: Good psychometric properties, including high test-retest reliability, were found for the dimensional scales except for SP-D. In outpatients, improvement at Time 2 was associated with significant decrease in PD-D, GAD-D, and Cross-D scores. Discussion Major advantages of the scales include that they are brief, concise, and based on a consistent template to measure the cognitive, physiological, and behavioral symptoms of fear and anxiety. Further replication in larger samples is needed. Given its modest psychometric properties, SP-D needs refinement.

METHOD: This was a multicenter prospective randomized observer-blinded study with two parallel groups. The authors assessed 180 patients with three or more previous major depressive episodes who met remission criteria over a 2-month baseline period and who were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of either maintenance CBT or manualized psychoeducation over 8 months and then followed up for 12 months. The main outcome measure was time to first relapse or recurrence of a major depression, based on DSM-IV criteria, as assessed by blinded observers with the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation. RESULTS: Cox regression analysis showed that time to relapse or recurrence of major depression did not differ significantly between treatment conditions, but a significant interaction was observed between treatment condition and number of previous episodes (<5 or >/=5). Within the subsample of patients with five or more previous episodes, maintenance CBT was significantly superior to manualized psychoeducation, whereas for patients with fewer than five previous episodes, no significant treatment differences were observed in time to relapse or recurrence.

Assessing attack-related fear in headache disorders-Structure and psychometric properties of the Fear of Attacks in Migraine Inventory,"Klan, T.; Brascher, A. K.; Klein, S.; Diezemann-Prossdorf, A.; Guth, A. L.; Gaul, C.; Witthoft, M.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a self-report questionnaire for the assessment of attack-related fear in migraine, and to determine its factor structure as well as its psychometric properties by the primary analysis of a cross-sectional survey's data. BACKGROUND: High fear of attacks in migraine increases the burden of disease and is assumed to have a negative impact on the course of the disease. Little is known about the structure and dimensionality of attack-related fear, and a valid instrument for the comprehensive assessment is lacking. METHODS: Based on a literature search and interviews with persons with migraine as well as with experienced practitioners, a 46-item self-report questionnaire, the Fear of Attacks in Migraine Inventory (FAMI) was developed. A cross-sectional online survey comprising an assessment of diagnostic criteria of migraine and a battery of questionnaires including the FAMI was conducted (N = 387 persons with migraine, 364/387 [94.1%] women, M = 40.9 [SD = 13.1] years, migraine without aura: 153/387 [39.5%], migraine with aura: 85/387 [22.0%], and chronic migraine: 149/387 [38.5%]). RESULTS: Item selection led to 29 items for the FAMI. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in three clearly interpretable factors (fear of negative consequences; attention and anticipation; fear-avoidance); a confirmatory factor analysis yielded an acceptable to good model fit (chi(2) (3) = 1328.84, p = 0.001, chi(2) /df = 3.55, RMSEA = 0.085, SRMR = 0.073, CFI = 0.98, and TLI = 0.97). Reliability was good (fear-avoidance, omega = 0.85; attention and anticipation, omega = 0.88) to excellent (fear of negative consequences, omega = 0.91).

Methods: A disorder-heterogeneous, naturalistic sample of N = 1,379 outpatients treated with either cognitive behavioral therapy or psychodynamic therapy was analyzed. Based on a combination of random forest and linear regression, differential treatment response was modeled in the training data (n = 966) to indicate each individual's optimal treatment. A separate holdout dataset (n = 413) was used to evaluate personalized recommendations. Results: The difference in outcomes between patients treated with their optimal vs. non-optimal treatment was significant in the training data, but non-significant in the holdout data (b = -0.043, p = .280). However, for the 50% of patients with the largest predicted benefit of receiving their optimal treatment, the average percentage of change on the BSI in the holdout data was 52.6% for their optimal and 38.4% for their non-optimal treatment (p = .017; d = 0.33 [0.06, 0.61]).

H.; Tennant, A.; Boecker, M.","OBJECTIVE: This study conducted a simulation study for computer-adaptive testing based on the Aachen Depression Item Bank (ADIB), which was developed for the assessment of depression in persons with somatic diseases. Prior to computer-adaptive test simulation, the ADIB was newly calibrated. METHODS: Recalibration was performed in a sample of 161 patients treated for a depressive syndrome, 103 patients from cardiology, and 103 patients from otorhinolaryngology (mean age 44.1, SD=14.0; 44.7% female) and was cross-validated in a sample of 117 patients undergoing rehabilitation for cardiac diseases (mean age 58.4, SD=10.5; 24.8% women). Unidimensionality of the itembank was checked and a Rasch analysis was performed that evaluated local dependency (LD), differential item functioning (DIF), item fit and reliability. CAT-simulation was conducted with the total sample and additional simulated data. RESULTS: Recalibration resulted in a strictly unidimensional item bank with 36 items, showing good Rasch model fit (item fit residuals<|2.5|) and no DIF or LD. CAT simulation revealed that 13 items on average were necessary to estimate depression in the range of -2 and +2 logits when terminating at SE</=0.32 and 4 items if using SE</=0.50. Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis showed that theta estimates based on the CAT algorithm have good criterion validity with regard to depression diagnoses (Area Under the Curve>/=.78 for all cut-off criteria).

"Body image disturbance and associated eating disorder and body dysmorphic disorder pathology in gay and heterosexual men: A systematic analyses of cognitive, affective, behavioral und perceptual aspects","Schmidt, M.; Taube, C. O.; Heinrich, T.; Vocks, S.; Hartmann, A. S.","OBJECTIVE: This study contributes to the quantitatively large, yet narrow in scope research on body image in gay men by assessing whether gay and heterosexual men systematically differ on various dimensions of body image disturbance and associated pathology, i.e., eating disorder and body dysmorphic disorder symptoms. Moreover, we examined the influence of general everyday discrimination experiences and involvement with the gay community on body image. METHOD: N = 216 men (n = 112 gay men, n = 104 heterosexual men) participated in an online survey measuring the discrepancy between self-rated current and ideal body fat/ muscularity; drive for leanness, muscularity, and thinness; body satisfaction; body-related avoidance and checking; appearance fixing; overall body image disturbance; eating disorder and body dysmorphic disorder pathology; general everyday discrimination experiences; and involvement with the gay community. RESULTS: Gay men showed a greater discrepancy between self-rated current and ideal body fat; higher drive for thinness, body-related avoidance, appearance fixing, overall body image disturbance, eating disorder and body dysmorphic disorder pathology; and lower body appreciation than heterosexual men (all p </= .05). Contrary to expectation, everyday discrimination experiences were more strongly associated with body image disturbance and eating disorder/ body dysmorphic disorder pathology in heterosexual men than in gay men (all p </= .05). Gay community involvement was not associated with any body image disturbance-, ED-, or BDD aspect in gay men (all p >/= .20). DISCUSSION: The results suggest greater body image disturbance in gay men than in heterosexual men regarding cognitions, emotions, behaviors, and perception as well as higher eating disorder and body dysmorphic disorder pathology. The results also suggest the dilemma of a thin, yet muscular body ideal in gay men. Surprisingly, discrimination experiences and involvement with the gay community did not explain differences in body image disturbance.

RESULTS: Around 5.88% of the variability in treatment outcome and 8.89% in treatment length were attributed to therapists. There was no relationship between the average effectiveness of therapists and the average length of their treatments. Initial impairment, early alliance, number of diagnoses, feedback as well as therapists' and patients' attitudes toward feedback were significant predictors of treatment outcome. Treatments tended to be longer for patients with a higher number of approved sessions by the insurance company, with higher levels of interpersonal distress at intake, and for those who developed negatively (negative feedback) over the course of their treatment.

METHOD: Forty therapists treating 621 patients were analyzed. Patients' symptoms and interpersonal problems were collected repeatedly during therapy. Data about patients' interpersonal problems were available only for 106 patients and 18 therapists. Therapists' difficulties were assessed as trait-based (one assessment across all patients) and as state-based (repeated assessments for each individual patient) difficulties. Multilevel models were performed. RESULTS: None of the trait-based difficulties correlated with the change of the patients' symptoms. Yet, more NPR at the trait-level predicted a more favorable change, whereas higher PSD at the trait-level showed an opposite effect on change of patients' interpersonal problems. Regarding state-based difficulties, PSD as well as NPR decreased significantly over the course of CBT. Patients whose therapists' experienced PSD to increase during CBT were at risk of a less favorable patient progress regarding symptoms, whereas the change of interpersonal problems was not significantly associated with changes in therapists' difficulties.

METHOD: A total sample of 112 participants comprising patients with acute anorexia nervosa (AN), women recovered from anorexia nervosa (REC), clinical controls (CC), and healthy controls (HC) completed measures of dependency and intimacy strivings, as well as measures of frustrations of these same strivings. RESULTS: In comparison to HC and CC, AN showed a stronger motivation to avoid dependency and lower strivings for intimacy. Compared with HC, but not with CC, AN also showed stronger frustrations of the same motives. Whereas REC did not differ from AN regarding avoidance of dependency, they reported lower frustration of dependency avoidance (i.e., less actual experiences of dependency). Finally, REC reported higher intimacy motivation as well as better satisfaction of intimacy motivation as compared with AN.

Beliefs about exercise: relationship to eating psychopathology and core beliefs among young female exercisers,"Meyer, C.; Blissett, J.; Alberry, R.; Sykes, A.","OBJECTIVE: This study had two objectives. First, to determine links between levels of eating psychopathology and beliefs about exercise among young women. Second, to determine the predictive effects of unhealthy core beliefs on exercise beliefs. METHOD: A convenience sample of 185 young female exercisers completed the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI), the Exercise Beliefs Questionnaire (EBQ) and the Young Schema Questionnaire (YSQ). RESULTS: The participants' mean scores on the EDI were as follows: drive for thinness=0.69 (SD=0.82); body dissatisfaction=1.30 (SD=0.86); and bulimia=0.33 (SD=0.42). There were significant, positive correlations of all three EDI scales with EBQ social and EBQ appearance subscales. In addition, YSQ Defectiveness/Shame beliefs predicted EBQ social scores, while YSQ Unrelenting Standards predicted EBQ appearance scores. DISCUSSION: Those women with relatively unhealthy eating attitudes are likely to believe that exercise will prevent negative social consequences, and are likely to be motivated to exercise in order to preserve or enhance their physical appearance. These same types of exercise belief (regarding social consequences and appearance) are predicted by feelings of defectiveness and shame and by unrelenting high personal standards.",2013,Jan,Eat Behav,14,1,79-82,23265407.0,10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.10.003,,#1447,Meyer 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Prospective evaluation of a clinical decision support system in psychological therapy,"Lutz, W.; Deisenhofer, A. K.; Rubel, J.; Bennemann, B.; Giesemann, J.; Poster, K.; Schwartz, B.","OBJECTIVE: Thus far, most applications in precision mental health have not been evaluated prospectively. This article presents the results of a prospective randomized-controlled trial investigating the effects of a digital decision support and feedback system, which includes two components of patient-specific recommendations: (a) a clinical strategy recommendation and (b) adaptive recommendations for patients at risk for treatment failure. METHOD: Therapist-patient dyads (N = 538) in a cognitive behavioral therapy outpatient clinic were randomized to either having access to a decision support system (intervention group; n = 335) or not (treatment as usual; n = 203). First, treatment strategy recommendations (problem-solving, motivation-oriented, or a mix of both strategies) for the first 10 sessions were evaluated. Second, the effect of psychometric feedback enhanced with clinical problem-solving tools on treatment outcome was investigated. RESULTS: The prospective evaluation showed a differential effect size of about 0.3 when therapists followed the recommended treatment strategy in the first 10 sessions. Moreover, the linear mixed models revealed therapist symptom awareness and therapist attitude and confidence as significant predictors of an outcome as well as therapist-rated usefulness of feedback as a significant moderator of the feedback-outcome and the not on track-outcome associations. However, no main effects were found for feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the importance of prospective studies and the high-quality implementation of digital decision support tools in clinical practice. Therapists seem to be able to learn from such systems and incorporate them into their clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes, but only when implementation is successful.

Depression is linked to hyperglycaemia via suboptimal diabetes self-management: A cross-sectional mediation analysis,"Schmitt, A.; Reimer, A.; Hermanns, N.; Kulzer, B.; Ehrmann, D.; Krichbaum, M.; Huber, J.; Haak, T.","OBJECTIVE: To analyse if the association between depressive symptoms and hyperglycaemia is mediated by diabetes self-management. METHODS: 430 people with diabetes (57.7% type 1, 42.3% type 2) were cross-sectionally assessed using validated self-report scales for depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)) and diabetes self-management (Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ)); HbA(1c) was analysed simultaneously in a central laboratory. Structural equation modelling was used to test if the association between depressive symptoms and hyperglycaemia (HbA(1c)) was mediated by suboptimal self-management in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: The hypothesised model of depressive symptoms, diabetes self-management and hyperglycaemia fit the data well for both diabetes types (SRMR</=0.04, TLI>/=0.99, CFI>0.99, RMSEA</=0.02 for both models). In both the type 1 and type 2 diabetes group, higher depressive symptoms were associated with lower self-management (P<0.001) and lower self-management was associated with higher HbA(1c) (P<0.001). Results indicated that the association between depressive symptoms and hyperglycaemia was significantly mediated by suboptimal diabetes self-management in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients (P<0.001).

Discriminant and convergent validity of a subjective quality-of-life instrument aimed at high content validity for schizophrenic persons,"Franz, M.; Fritz, M.; Meyer, T.","OBJECTIVE: To analyse whether a subjective quality-of-life (QoL) instrument (QLiS-Quality-of-Life in Schizophrenia), developed on the basis of a large number of open-ended interviews with schizophrenic patients, has sufficient discriminant and convergent validity to justify its application as a schizophrenia-specific QoL instrument. METHOD: The discriminant and convergent validity of the QLiS (comprising 12 subscales) was analysed in a cross-sectional study. Schizophrenic persons (n = 135) from different care settings were surveyed using the QLiS, the WHOQOL-Bref, the SWN and 7-point satisfaction items. Partial correlational analyses and regression analyses controlling for general life satisfaction were conducted comparing the QLiS subscales with those of the other instruments. RESULTS: Positive correlation coefficients were found among all subscales of the QLiS and the other QoL instruments (WHOQOL-BREF from r = 0.29 to r = 0.72; SWN, r = 0.14 to r = 0.83; satisfaction scales, r = 0.18 to r = 0.69). One QLiS subscale (cognitive functioning) was shown to be empirically redundant (r>0.80) to the mental functioning subscale of the SWN. All other subscales proved to have unique variance. The non-QLiS QoL instruments only accounted for substantial amounts of variance (>20% after controlling for global life satisfaction) in the QLiS subscales leading a normal life, appreciation by others, appraisal of accommodation/housing and social contacts. DISCUSSION: Most of the QLiS subscales can be regarded as sufficiently distinct from other QoL instruments, and thus show evidence of discriminant and convergent validity. CONCLUSION: A subjective QoL questionnaire with high content validity can provide additional empirical information about schizophrenics' QoL not accounted for by other common QoL instruments.",2013,Jun,Qual Life Res,22,5,1113-22,22723151.0,10.1007/s11136-012-0221-8,,#1450,Franz 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Associations of depression and diabetes distress with self-management behavior and glycemic control,"Schmitt, A.; Bendig, E.; Baumeister, H.; Hermanns, N.; Kulzer, B.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze the independent associations of depression and diabetes distress with self-management and glycemic outcome in Type I (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHOD: Six hundred six people with T1DM or T2DM participated in a cross-sectional survey including measures of depression (PHQ-9), diabetes distress (PAID-5), self-management behavior (DSMQ), and glycemic outcome (HbA1c). Structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the independent linear associations (standardized coefficients) between these variables. RESULTS: In those with T1DM (n = 339), both depressive symptoms and diabetes distress were associated with lower self-management (-0.34, p < .001, and -0.16, p = .007, respectively) and thereover (indirectly) with higher HbA1c (0.20, p < .001, and 0.10, p = .016, respectively); direct associations with HbA1c were not observed. In those with T2DM (n = 267), only depressive symptoms were associated with lower self-management (-0.41, p < .001) and thus (indirectly) with higher HbA1c (0.17, p < .001). Diabetes distress, by contrast, was directly associated with higher HbA1c (0.20, p = .003) but not with self-management. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that depression is linked to less optimal diabetes self-management, thus leading to less optimal glycemic outcome. The associations were relatively consistent across diabetes types. Diabetes distress was additionally associated with higher glycemic levels, suggesting that people with both depression and diabetes distress might have the least optimal outcome. The conclusions are limited by the cross-sectional study design, self-report assessment of behavior, and potential bias arising from questionnaire measures. Further research is needed to support these findings.

"Health-related quality of life and treatment effects on children with functional incontinence, and their parents","Equit, M.; Hill, J.; Hubner, A.; von Gontard, A.","OBJECTIVE: To analyze treatment outcomes and the association between treatment effects and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for incontinent children, and their parents. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Health-related quality of life in 70 consecutively treated children, and their parents, was assessed with the Pediatric Incontinence Questionnaire and the WHO-Quality-Of-Life-BREF questionnaire. This was assessed before and after three months of standardized treatment. RESULTS: In 44.3% of children, symptoms decreased by 50-89%. After three months of treatment, the HRQoL of children improved significantly. Children with bladder and bowel dysfunction had a significantly lower HRQoL than children with isolated nocturnal enuresis, daytime urinary incontinence or fecal incontinence. Parental HRQoL did not change significantly within three months of treatment. Parents showed a significantly lower mean in the 'psychological' domain of the WHO-QoL-BREF questionnaire compared to norms. CONCLUSION: Children with different subtypes of incontinence can be treated effectively within three months of therapy. After three months, significant improvements of HRQoL were shown.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 152 children in three groups were examined. 81 children were out-patients. Of these, 36 children were being seen for the first time and 45 children had previously undergone bladder and bowel group training. They were compared to 71 continent controls. Children were given a body silhouette, in which they drew their view of the urinary tract. RESULTS: Half of the children (52.6%) drew a bladder and other organs; nearly 43% drew a tube or other anatomically incorrect pictures. Significant differences were found for group and age. Children who had undergone the group training more often drew a bladder and other organs (80%). Correct pictures and pictures of bladder and other organs were more common from children aged 11-16 years.

Calibration of an item bank in 474 orthopedic patients using Rasch analysis for computer-adaptive assessment of anxiety,"Kallinger, S.; Scharm, H.; Boecker, M.; Forkmann, T.; Baumeister, H.",OBJECTIVE: To calibrate an item bank of anxiety-related questions for use in orthopedic patients within a computer-adaptive test. DESIGN: This is a psychometric study. SETTING: The sample of orthopedic patients was recruited in two orthopedic rehabilitation clinics in Germany. SUBJECTS: A total of 474 orthopedic rehabilitation patients were recruited for this study. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN MEASURES: The main measure is an adapted version of an existing anxiety item pool for cardiovascular rehabilitation patients. RESULTS: The results of the confirmatory factor analysis and Mokken analysis confirmed a one-factor structure and double monotonicity. An anxiety item bank (48 items) could be developed and calibrated using Rasch analysis. It fitted to the Rasch model with a non-significant item-trait interaction (chi(2)(203) = 172.59; P = .94) and was free of differential item functioning. Unidimensionality could be verified and the person separation reliability was .96. The category threshold parameters varied between 4.72 and 3.16 (7.88 logits).

"Does clinically relevant psychopathology in adolescents necessarily require treatment or does it ""grow out""?","Volz, M.; Ehrenthal, J. C.; Seiffge-Krenke, I.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the treatment effect of psychodynamic therapy for adolescents in comparison to normative developmental progression in two groups without treatment: healthy adolescents and adolescents with juvenile diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a 3-wave longitudinal study, n = 531 adolescents (n = 303 treated adolescents, n = 119 healthy, n = 109 with diabetes) and their parents filled out psychopathology questionnaires (Youth Self-Report [YSR] and Child Behaviour Checklist [CBCL]). Growth curve modeling (GCM) was used to examine within-person change in psychopathology while controlling for stable between-person differences. RESULTS: GCM analyses revealed significant within-person reductions in patients' YSR and CBCL (d = 1.02-1.99) at the end of treatment. When accounted for the control groups' developmental progression (d = .14-.94), patients' within-person change remained significantly higher (d = .48-.82). In all three groups, parents rated the severity of psychopathology significantly lower, and within-person change significantly higher than the adolescents him/herself. CONCLUSIONS: Psychodynamic therapy led to a significant symptom reduction in treated adolescents and was superior to development-related symptom changes occurring in the two control groups. Hence, clinically relevant symptoms in adolescents do not ""grow out"", but require psychotherapeutic treatment.

Emotion regulation in patients with heart failure: Its relationship with depressive symptoms and rehospitalization,"Chavanon, M. L.; Meyer, T.; Belnap, B. H.; Huang, Y.; Abebe, K. Z.; Rollman, B. L.; Herrmann-Lingen, C.","OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of emotion regulation and its relationship to mental and physical health in patients with heart failure (HF). METHODS: Patients hospitalized with HF were screened for depressive symptoms with the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and classified as screen-positive if endorsing >/=1 item and otherwise as screen-negative. One month after hospital discharge, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) was administered to assess suppression and reappraisal as emotion regulation strategies. In all participants who completed the ERQ (N = 394), all-cause rehospitalization and depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9 were assessed at 1-, 3-, and 6-months after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Overall, PHQ-9 scores decreased by 6-months (-0.13 points/month, p = .003), and although suppression showed a small association with depression, neither strategy modulated the slope of the decline in depressive symptoms. Multivariable-adjusted Cox models showed that reappraisal and suppression were not related to all-cause rehospitalization in the entire cohort. However, increasing reappraisal reduced rehospitalization risk by 24% for screen-positive patients (N = 311, HR = 0.76, p = .02), but increased it by 94% in screen-negative patients (N = 83, HR = 1.94, p = .009). CONCLUSION: Suppression and reappraisal showed specific and divergent associations in patients with HF: Suppression may relate to depressive symptoms. Reappraisal was associated with rehospitalization, but differently for patients with a positive vs. negative depression screen.

METHODS: Data of 205 adults with T1DM from the 2011 and 2015 Diabetes MILES-Australia surveys were analysed. Variables of interest were: baseline depression and anxiety (PHQ-8 and GAD-7, respectively) symptoms; HbA(1c) and incident complications at four-year follow-up; and self-care behaviours at both time points. Longitudinal associations were analysed using structural equation modelling. RESULTS: Forty-two participants (20.6%) reported incident complications. Baseline depressive symptoms predicted higher HbA(1c) at follow-up indirectly via less optimal self-care at follow-up (beta = 0.19, P = 0.011). Baseline anxiety was not independently associated with HbA(1c) or self-care at follow-up (P >/= 0.64). Neither depressive nor anxiety symptoms predicted incident complications, although depressive symptoms were associated with less optimal self-care at baseline (beta = -0.67, P < 0.001), and this predicted microvascular complications (beta = -0.38, P = 0.044); however, the indirect association via self-care was not significant (beta = 0.25, P = 0.067). LIMITATIONS: Participants were self-selected; all study variables were assessed using self-report measures; and adjusting for baseline HbA(1c) was not possible.

A.; Bauer, K.; Feldmann, R., Jr.; Benrath, J.","OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound (US)-guided pain procedures become increasingly important due to their numerous advantages. Solid proficiency is necessary, however, to minimize complications and guarantee adequate performance. To enable beginners to learn the relevant skills in the technique of US-guided stellate ganglion (SGB) and intercostal nerve block (ICB), a training curriculum was developed and tested using self-made phantoms. DESIGN: The curriculum comprised an introduction to the didactics of US, SGB, and ICB, a demonstration of the techniques by an expert user, as well as hands-on training of needle guidance using a gel pad and two phantoms. SUBJECTS: Three groups of participants with different levels of expertise with US-guided procedures took part in the curriculum: 12 medical students with no prior experience, 12 anesthesiologists with some experience, and five senior anesthesiologists who already applied these techniques on a regular basis. METHODS: Participants evaluated the curriculum via questionnaire, and their performance of time until adequate puncture, attempts required for adequate puncture, number of corrections, and unintentional punctures was assessed. RESULTS: The medical students significantly increased their speed during both nerve blocks and reduced the number of attempts and corrections necessary to perform adequate ICB. The anesthesiologists with some experience also increased their speed in both blocks. The participants rated the curriculum as good to very good.

Psychological capacity limitations according to Mini-ICF-APP are differently related with sick leave in patients from different professional fields,"Muschalla, B.","OBJECTIVE: Up to 29% of the working population suffer from (chronic) mental disorders and work disability. As different professions pose different psychological capacity demands, one core aspect for describing work disability is psychological capacity limitations. The distribution of capacity limitations in patients with chronic mental disorders (CMD) from different professional fields is unknown, as well as their relation with sick leave. OBJECTIVE: Are there different work ability limitations in CMD patients working in different professions? METHODS: 263 CMD patients from different professions were investigated cross-sectionally in a thorough medical and psychological assessment by a trained psychosomatic study physician. Besides CMD diagnostic (MINI) and subjective work ability limitations (IMET), an observer rating on capacity limitations was conducted with Mini-ICF-APP. RESULTS: No relevant differences in perceived work ability limitations were found between the professions. Differences of capacity limitations were better explained by psychopathology than by profession. But capacity limitations were differently related with sick leave in different professions and there are differences in sick leave duration. CONCLUSIONS: The variance of capacity limitations was explained by psychopathology. The variance of sick leave duration was explained by profession. Similar capacity limitations are associated differently with sick leave in different professions. Different professional fields may have different tolerances towards the same capacity limitations. Therefore, similar capacity limitations are more or less strongly associated with sick leave in different professions.",2019,Sep,J Psychosom Res,124,,109741,31443813.0,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2019.109741,,#1465,Muschalla 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Effects of the three exposure conditions on fear of food and food avoidance were examined. RESULTS: Contrary to our expectations, very brief food cue exposure was not superior to the control conditions regarding fear of food and approach behaviour towards food immediately after the intervention and body mass index four weeks later.

The specific social costs of expressive negative symptoms in schizophrenia: reduced smiling predicts interactional outcome,"Riehle, M.; Mehl, S.; Lincoln, T. M.",OBJECTIVE: We tested whether people with schizophrenia and prominent expressive negative symptoms (ENS) show reduced facial expressions in face-to-face social interactions and whether this expressive reduction explains negative social evaluations of these persons. METHOD: We compared participants with schizophrenia with high ENS (n = 18) with participants with schizophrenia with low ENS (n = 30) and with healthy controls (n = 39). Participants engaged in an affiliative role-play that was coded for the frequency of positive and negative facial expression and rated for social performance skills and willingness for future interactions with the respective role-play partner. RESULTS: Participants with schizophrenia with high ENS showed significantly fewer positive facial expressions than those with low ENS and controls and were also rated significantly lower on social performance skills and willingness for future interactions. Participants with schizophrenia with low ENS did not differ from controls on these measures. The group difference in willingness for future interactions was significantly and independently mediated by the reduced positive facial expressions and social performance skills. CONCLUSION: Reduced facial expressiveness in schizophrenia is specifically related to ENS and has negative social consequences. These findings highlight the need to develop aetiological models and targeted interventions for ENS and its social consequences.,2018,Aug,Acta Psychiatr Scand,138,2,133-144,29667181.0,10.1111/acps.12892,,#1468,Riehle 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

"Treatment for Pediatric Functional Abdominal Pain: An Initial Examination of Reciprocal Associations Between Pain, Functional Impairment, and Parental Distress","Calvano, C.; Warschburger, P.","OBJECTIVE: While cross-sectional studies underline that child and parent factors in pediatric chronic pain are reciprocally related, so far, little is known on their prospective relationship, especially in treatment contexts. This study aims to analyze directions of influence between child and parental outcomes using data from an intervention study. METHODS: The sample covered 109 families with children aged 7-13 years diagnosed with functional abdominal pain (FAP). Child outcomes included pain and impairment, and parental outcomes covered caregiver-specific distress including both parental personal time burden (i.e., less time available for personal needs) and emotional burden due to child's pain (i.e., increased worries). Cross-lagged panel analyses examined the directions of the relations between child and parental outcomes across time (pretreatment T1, post-treatment T2, and 3-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up T3/T4). RESULTS: First, a significant improvement over time in all measures was observed. Cross-lagged effects were found for less parental personal time burden at T2, predicting both less pain (beta = -0.254, p = .004) and less impairment (beta = -0.150, p = .039) at T3. Higher baseline pain was predictive for higher parental emotional burden after treatment (beta = -0.130, p = .049) and, reversely, for less emotional burden at 12-month follow-up (beta = 0.261, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Addressing parental personal time burden in FAP treatment might possibly support the improvement on the child level. Replication of results in larger samples is warranted to gain more insight into the directions of influence and, in that way, to optimize treatment for pediatric FAP.",2022,Apr 8,J Pediatr Psychol,47,4,483-496,35237811.0,10.1093/jpepsy/jsac011,,#1470,Calvano 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Does Health Literacy Make a Difference? Comparing the Effect of Conventional Medicine Versus Homeopathic Prescribing on Treatment Credibility and Expectancy,"Wilhelm, M.; Euteneuer, F.","OBJECTIVE: While homeopathic remedies are often used to treat non-specific complaints such as headaches, empirical evidence suggests their treatment effect is due to the placebo effect. Low health literacy seems to be connected to higher use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The aim of this study was to examine what people with occasional headaches expect from conventional medicine or homeopathic remedies and if health literacy interacts with this expectation. METHODS: In this experimental study, n = 582 participants with occasional headaches were randomized to read one of two vignettes, which described the prescription of either conventional medicine or a homeopathic remedy. Subsequently, the participants were asked to rate treatment credibility and expectancy with regard to their assigned vignette. Health literacy was assessed as a potential moderator. RESULTS: Participants in the conventional medicine group rated treatment credibility and expectancy higher than in the homeopathic remedy group. Moderation analysis revealed that when being offered conventional medicine, participant reports of treatment credibility and expectancy decreased with lower health literacy, while these outcomes increased with lower health literacy for homeopathic remedies. DISCUSSION: People with occasional headaches estimate the effectiveness of conventional medication properly. However, health care professionals should pay special attention to patients with low health literacy, as they might need more time and information to give their informed consent.",2021,2021/06/01,Front Psychol,12,,581255,34140910.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.581255,,#1471,Wilhelm 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Somatosensory amplification moderates the efficacy of internet-delivered CBT for somatic symptom distress in emerging adults: Exploratory analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"Hennemann, S.; Witthoft, M.; Kleinstauber, M.; Bohme, K.; Baumeister, H.; Ebert, D. D.; Probst, T.","OBJECTIVE: While studies mainly provide positive evidence for the efficacy of internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) for various persistent somatic symptoms, it remains largely unclear for whom these interventions work or not. This exploratory analysis aimed to identify moderators for the outcome between ICBT for somatic symptom distres and a waitlist control group (WL) in a vulnerable target group of emerging adults. METHODS: Based on data from a randomized controlled trial on 156 university students with varying degrees of somatic symptom distress who were allocated to either an eight-week, therapist guided ICBT (iSOMA) or to the WL, we examined pretreatment demographic characteristics, health-related variables (e.g., somatic symptom duration), mental distress (e.g., depression, anxiety) and cognitive-emotional factors (emotional reactivity, somatosensory amplification) as candidate moderators of the outcome, somatic symptom distress (assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-15) from pre- to posttreatment. RESULTS: Somatosensory amplification (assessed by the Somatosensory Amplification Scale, SSAS) moderated the outcome in favor of iSOMA (B = -0.17, SE = 0.08, p = 0.031), i.e., higher pretreatment somatosensory amplification was associated with better outcome in the active compared to the control intervention. No significant moderation effects were found among demographic characteristics, health-related variables, or mental distress. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that an internet-delivered CBT for somatic symptom distress should be preferred over no active treatment particularly in individuals with moderate to high levels of somatosensory amplification, which as a next step should be tested against further treatments and in clinical populations.

Capacity Limitations and Workplace Problems in Patients With Mental Disorders,"Muschalla, B.; Linden, M.","OBJECTIVES: According to the bio-psycho-social health model of the WHO, chronic illness should not only be described at the level of symptoms, but in respect to capacity limitations. METHODS: Patients with common mental disorders (N = 1143, n = 808 employed, n = 581 workplace problems) were investigated concerning their self-rated capacities (Mini-ICF-APP-S). RESULTS: Employed patients reported better capacities than unemployed patients. Among the employed patients, those without workplace problems reported better capacities than those with workplace-problems. Different types of workplace-problems were related with specific capacity levels, for example, problems with bullying or conflicts were associated with lower interactional capacities (assertiveness, group integration, dyadic relations), whereas patients with over-taxation problems perceived lower levels of flexibility, competency, structuring of tasks, proactivity and endurance.

Traumatic Events and Substance Use Disorders in Adolescents,"Basedow, L. A.; Kuitunen-Paul, S.; Roessner, V.; Golub, Y.","OBJECTIVES: Adolescents with substance use disorders (SUD) frequently report traumatic events (TEs) and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to assess whether lifetime prevalence rates of TEs and PTSD are related to SUD severity in adolescent psychiatric patients. METHODS: We analyzed N = 114 self-reports of treatment-seeking German adolescents aged 12 to 18 years, who visited a specialized SUD outpatient unit. Standardized questionnaires were applied to assess SUD severity, the number of TEs and DSM-IV PTSD criteria. RESULTS: Patients fulfilling PTSD criteria (28% of the total sample) had a higher Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) score compared to non-PTSD patients with TEs (p <.001), and compared to adolescents without TEs or PTSD (p = .003). Additionally, SUD severity was positively associated with the number of TEs and the number of intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance symptoms (all r = .33 to.48, all p <.01). DISCUSSION: Adolescent patients with SUD reported 3-times higher rates of TEs, and a 5-time higher prevalence of PTSD following TEs, than the general adolescent population.

Are effort-based decision-making tasks worth the effort?-A study on the associations between effort-based decision-making tasks and self-report measures,"Renz, K. E.; Schlier, B.; Lincoln, T. M.","OBJECTIVES: Amotivation is a common symptom in various mental disorders, including psychotic or depressive disorders. Effort-based decision-making (EBDM)-tasks quantifying amotivation at a behavioral level have been on the rise. Task performance has been shown to differentiate patient groups from healthy controls. However, findings on indicators of construct validity, such as the correlations between different tasks and between tasks and self-reported/observer-rated amotivation in clinical and healthy samples have been inconclusive. METHODS: In a representative community sample (N = 90), we tested the construct validity of the Deck Choice Task, the Expenditure for Rewards Task and the Balloon Task. We calculated correlations between the EBDM-tasks and between the EBDM-tasks and self-reported amotivation, apathy, anticipatory pleasure, and BIS/BAS. RESULTS: Correlations between tasks were low to moderate (0.198 </= r </= 0.358), with the Balloon Task showing the largest correlations with the other tasks, but no significant correlations between any EBDM-task and the self-report measures. CONCLUSION: Although different EBDM-tasks are conceptualized to measure the same construct, a large part of what each task measures could not be accounted for by the other tasks. Moreover, the tasks did not appear to substantially capture what was measured in established self-report instruments for amotivation in our sample, which could be interpreted as questioning the construct validity of EBDM-tasks.",2023,Mar,Int J Methods Psychiatr Res,32,1,e1943,36088538.0,10.1002/mpr.1943,,#1479,Renz 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Associations of androgens with depressive symptoms and cognitive status in the general population,"Kische, H.; Gross, S.; Wallaschofski, H.; Grabe, H. J.; Volzke, H.; Nauck, M.; Haring, R.","OBJECTIVES: Associations between androgens and depressive symptoms were mostly reported from cross-sectional and patient-based studies. STUDY DESIGN/MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Longitudinal data from 4,110 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania were used to assess sex-specific associations of baseline total and free testosterone, androstenedione and sex hormone-binding globulin with incident depressive symptoms and cognitive status at 5- and 10-year follow-up. RESULTS: Despite sex-specific differences in depressive symptoms prevalence at baseline (women: 17.4%, men: 8.1%), cross-sectional analyses showed no associations between sex hormones and depressive symptoms. In age-adjusted longitudinal analyses, total testosterone was associated with incident depressive symptoms (relative risk at 5-year follow-up: 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.92). Similarly, age-adjusted analyses showed a positive association between sex hormone-binding globulin and cognitive status in men (beta-coefficient per standard deviation: 0.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.74). In women, age-adjusted associations of androstenedione with baseline depressive symptoms (relative risk: 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.99) were found. None of the observed associations remained after multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The present population-based, longitudinal study revealed inverse associations between sex hormones and depressive symptoms. However, the null finding after multivariable adjustment suggests, that the observed associations were not independent of relevant confounders including body mass index, smoking and physical inactivity.

Hyperactivity and impulsivity in adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is related to glutamatergic dysfunction in the anterior cingulate cortex,"Bauer, J.; Werner, A.; Kohl, W.; Kugel, H.; Shushakova, A.; Pedersen, A.; Ohrmann, P.","OBJECTIVES: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is closely linked to the dysregulation of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission in the fronto-striatal neural network, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Additionally, increasing evidence supports the involvement of the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Impulsivity, a core symptom in patients with ADHD, has been repeatedly associated with glutamatergic neurotransmission, and pharmacological treatment of ADHD has been shown to reduce glutamate levels in the prefrontal cortex. METHODS: We investigated glutamate levels in the ACC and the DLPFC in 30 adults with ADHD and 30 healthy controls using single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a 3T scanner. RESULTS: The ADHD group showed a significant increase in glutamate in the ACC compared to controls, no significant differences in metabolites were observed in the DLPFC. Overall, glutamate levels in the ACC were positively correlated with ADHD symptomatology, especially hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of glutamate in the ACC, which were positively correlated with hyperactivity and impulsivity, support the hypothesis that dysfunctional glutamatergic neurotransmission is at least partially responsible for ADHD symptomatology.

Improving the assessment of functional impairment in tinnitus sufferers: validation of the German version of the Tinnitus Functional Index using a confirmatory factor analysis,"Huttenrauch, E.; Jensen, M.; Ivansic, D.; Dobel, C.; Weise, C.","OBJECTIVES: Chronic tinnitus negatively impacts daily functioning. To specifically assess this impairment, the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) was developed. The current study investigated the hierarchical, eight-factorial structure for the German TFI and examined its psychometric properties. DESIGN: In an online assessment, the TFI and other validated health-related measurements were completed. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to investigate the factorial structure by testing two competing models: (1) a general factor model, and (2) a hierarchical second-order factor model. STUDY SAMPLE: 316 research volunteers (59.8% female) with low to moderate tinnitus distress were included. RESULTS: CFA revealed an insufficient fit of the data to the general factor model.

Young people's trauma-related cognitions before and after cognitive processing therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder,"Konig, J.; Kopp, B.; Ziegelmeier, A.; Rimane, E.; Steil, R.; Renneberg, B.; Rosner, R.","OBJECTIVES: Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is a psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a broad evidence base. Change in trauma-related cognitions is considered its primary working mechanism. When trying to integrate a traumatic event into existing cognitive schemas, the adaptive mechanism is changing the schema (accommodation). However, PTSD patients frequently either change their schemas too much (over-accommodation), or cognitively distort the event (assimilation). We aimed to test the hypothesized connections between the three types of cognition and symptom load. DESIGN: This study adds to the literature using 'impact statements', essays on their trauma-related thoughts written by patients at the beginning and end of CPT, to investigate cognitive change and its relationship to symptomatic outcome. METHODS: We analysed statements written by 31 adolescents and young adults who received developmentally adapted CPT (a longer treatment where CPT is the core component) in a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: As expected, post-CPT statements contained more accommodated and fewer over-accommodated and assimilated clauses than pre-CPT statements. Correlations between cognition frequencies and concurrent symptom load were as expected for assimilation, and, in part, over-accommodation and accommodation. Decreased PTSD and depressive symptoms were correlated with increased accommodated thoughts. For over-accommodation and assimilation, however, expected correlations could not be shown.

The efficacy of a transdiagnostic emotion regulation skills training in the treatment of binge-eating disorder-Results from a randomized controlled trial,"Berking, M.; Eichler, E.; Naumann, E.; Svaldi, J.","OBJECTIVES: Deficits in emotion regulation (ER) have been shown to be associated with binge-eating disorder (BED). To further clarify the causal nature of this association, we tested whether systematically enhancing ER skills would reduce symptoms of BED. METHODS: We randomly allocated N = 101 individuals meeting the criteria for BED to a transdiagnostic ER skills training or to a waitlist control condition (WLC). Primary outcome was the reduction in binges during the treatment-vs.-waiting period as assessed with the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) interview. RESULTS: Mixed-model ANOVAs indicated that the average pre-to-post decrease in binges assessed with the EDE was significantly greater in the ER skills training condition than in the WLC (d = 0.66). These effects were stable over the 6-month follow-up period (d = 0.72). Remission rates at post/follow-up were 34.4/45.0% in the skills training and 7.5/20.0% in the WLC. Additionally, we found a greater reduction in general eating disorder psychopathology, of food consumption in a bogus taste test and of depression in the ER skills training condition. Moreover, the greater reduction in binge-eating episodes in the training condition was (partially) mediated by a greater increase in ER skills. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide further support for the assumed importance of deficits in ER as a maintaining factor and, hence, as a target in the treatment of BED. As ER skills trainings have been shown to also reduce other kinds of psychopathology, they might be considered a promising transdiagnostic add-on component to disorder-specific interventions.",2022,Nov,Br J Clin Psychol,61,4,998-1018,35567309.0,10.1111/bjc.12371,,#1485,Berking 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Autistic traits and empathy in chronic vs. episodic depression,"Domes, G.; Spenthof, I.; Radtke, M.; Isaksson, A.; Normann, C.; Heinrichs, M.","OBJECTIVES: Difficulties in social interaction are characteristic for depressive disorders and one of the cardinal symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). It has been proposed that chronically depressed persons have profoundly impaired empathic abilities in comparison to episodically depressed persons, and that specifically they exhibit a deficit in cognitive empathy, but not in affective empathy, a pattern also reported in ASD. This study aimed to explore autistic traits and empathy deficits in chronic depression, and identify specific differences to episodic depression. METHOD: Autistic traits and multimodal empathy were assessed in chronically depressed patients (n=59), episodically depressed patients (n=40), and a healthy control group (n=55) using standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: Regardless of the disorder's chronicity, depressed patients exhibited higher levels of autistic traits and lower levels of perspective-taking than healthy controls. Chronically depressed patients reported significantly higher impairment in social skills and higher levels of personal distress in social interactions than episodic patients. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that patients with chronic depression share two distinct characteristics, namely lower levels of social skills and higher levels of distress in tense social situations than patients with episodic depression. Future studies will need to determine whether the elevated autistic traits in chronic depression are specific to chronic depression, or represent the general tendency to withdraw from social situations. We conclude that chronically depressed patients are not specifically impaired in understanding another person's state of mind, but are unable to deal with another person's suffering or negative affective state.",2016,May,J Affect Disord,195,,144-7,26895092.0,10.1016/j.jad.2016.02.006,,#1486,Domes 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Expectations, end-of-life fears and end-of-life communication among palliative patients with cancer and caregivers: a cross-sectional study","von Blanckenburg, P.; Riera Knorrenschild, J.; Hofmann, M.; Fries, H.; Nestoriuc, Y.; Seifart, U.; Rief, W.; Seifart, C.","OBJECTIVES: During serious illness, open communication with caregivers can ensure high-quality care. Without end-of-life communication, caregivers may become surrogates and decision-makers without knowing the patient's preferences. However, expectations and fears may influence the initiation of communication. The present study investigates differences between palliative patients with cancer and caregivers regarding expectations of end-of-life communication, end-of-life fears and experiences with end-of-life communication. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using a semi-structured interview and a paper-based questionnaire SETTING: University Hospital in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: 151 participants: 85 palliative cancer patients (mean age: 62.8 years, 65.9% male) and 66 caregivers (mean age: 56.3 years, 28.8% male). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Expectations, end-of-life fears and experiences of end-of-life discussions. RESULTS: Patients and caregivers wish for the patient to be self-determined. In general, participants reported more positive than negative expectations of end-of-life discussions. Importantly, concerns about emotionally burdening other person was rated much higher in an informal context than a professional context (F(1,149)=316 958, p<0.001, eta(p)(2)=0.680), even though the emotional relief was expected to be higher (F(1,149)=46.115, p<0.001, eta(p)(2)=0.236). Caregivers reported more fears about the last period of life and more fears about end-of-life discussions than palliative patients, whereas palliative patients tended to avoid the topics of death and dying to a greater extent. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to exist a 'self-other' asymmetry: palliative patients and their caregivers expect substantial personal relief when openly talking about end-of-life issues, but also expect the other person to be burdened by such communication. Professionals repeatedly need to initiate end-of-life communication.",2022,May 11,BMJ Open,12,5,e058531,35545378.0,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058531,,#1487,vonBlanckenburg 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Focusing on situation-specific expectations in major depression as basis for behavioural experiments - Development of the Depressive Expectations Scale,"Kube, T.; D'Astolfo, L.; Glombiewski, J. A.; Doering, B. K.; Rief, W.","OBJECTIVES: Dysfunctional expectations are considered to be core features of various mental disorders. The aim of the study was to develop the Depressive Expectations Scale (DES) as a depression-specific measure for the assessment of dysfunctional expectations. Whereas previous research primarily focused on general cognitions and attitudes, the DES assesses 25 future-directed expectations (originally 75 items) which are situation-specific and falsifiable. DESIGN AND METHODS: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the DES, the scale was completed by 175 participants with and without severe depressive symptoms in an online survey. Participants additionally completed the Patient Health Questionnaire modules for depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7). People experiencing depressive symptoms were informed about the study with the help of self-help organizations. RESULTS: Reliability analyses indicated excellent internal consistency of the scale. An exploratory factor analyses revealed four factors: social rejection, social support, mood regulation, and ability to perform. The DES sum score strongly correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms. The DES sum score also significantly correlated with symptoms of generalized anxiety. CONCLUSION: The DES was shown to have excellent reliability; validity analyses were promising. As the DES items are situation-specific and falsifiable, they can be tested by the individual using behavioural experiments and may therefore facilitate cognitive restructuring. Thus, a structured assessment of patients' expectation with help of the DES can provide a basis for interventions within cognitive-behavioural treatment of depression. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Assessing situation-specific expectations in patients experiencing depressive symptoms can provide a basis for the conduction of behavioural experiments to test patients' expectations. For the use of behavioural experiments, therapists should choose those dysfunctional expectations which a patient strongly agrees on.

Are psychotherapeutic effects on family caregivers of people with dementia sustainable? Two-year long-term effects of a telephone-based cognitive behavioral intervention,"Wilz, G.; Meichsner, F.; Soellner, R.","OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of long-term effects of an individualized short-term telephone intervention (seven sessions), based on a comprehensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approach. The study goal was to evaluate the maintenance of intervention effects regarding well-being, quality of life, and health at two years post treatment. METHOD: Participants (n = 105) were (partly) randomized after baseline assessment in a two-arm study (intervention, control group/usual care). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the German version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Caregivers' physical complaints were measured with the Giessener Beschwerdebogen (GBB-24), and quality of life with the World Health Organization quality of life -BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). Emotional well-being and perceived health status were assessed using thermometer scaling. Data were analyzed by intention-to-treat analyses, including for those who terminated the intervention prematurely but still delivered data, using ANCOVAs. RESULTS: Long-term intervention effects were found for emotional well-being (p = 0.019). For the subgroup of caregivers who were still caring at home at follow-up, the intervention led to an increased health status (p = 0.023), fewer bodily complaints (global measure p= 0.014, rheumatic pain p = 0.027, heart trouble p = 0.042), and a higher quality of life (overall p = 0.044 and subscale environment p = 0.030).

"Genes in treatment: Polygenic risk scores for different psychopathologies, neuroticism, educational attainment and IQ and the outcome of two different exposure-based fear treatments","Wannemuller, A.; Kumsta, R.; Johren, H. P.; Eley, T. C.; Teismann, T.; Moser, D.; Rayner, C.; Breen, G.; Coleman, J.; Schaumburg, S.; Blackwell, S. E.; Margraf, J.","OBJECTIVES: Evidence for a genetic influence on psychological treatment outcome so far has been inconsistent, likely due to the focus on candidate genes and the heterogeneity of the disorders treated. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) in homogenous patient samples may increase the chance of detecting genetic influences. METHODS: A sample of 342 phobic patients treated either for clinically relevant dental fear (n = 189) or other (mixed) phobic fears (n = 153) underwent highly standardised exposure-based CBT. A brief five-session format was used to treat dental fear, whereas longer multi-session treatments were used with the mixed-fear cohort. PRS were calculated based on large genetic studies of Neuroticism, Educational Attainment (EA), Intelligence, and four psychopathology domains. We compared PRS of post-treatment and follow-up remitters and non-remitters and regressed PRS on fear reduction percentages. RESULTS: In the dental fear cohort, EA PRS were associated with treatment outcomes, i.e. drop-out, short- and long-term remission state, fear reduction, and attendance of subsequent dental appointments. In the mixed fear treatment cohort, no gene effects were observable. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate the importance of EA-related traits for outcomes following brief, but not long, standardised exposure-based CBT. Such use of PRS may help inform selection and tailoring of treatments.",2021,Nov,World J Biol Psychiatry,22,9,699-712,33970774.0,10.1080/15622975.2021.1907708,,#1490,Wannemuller 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Neural correlates of performance monitoring in adult patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome: A study of event-related potentials,"Warren, C.; Seer, C.; Lange, F.; Kopp, B.; Muller-Vahl, K.","OBJECTIVES: Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by motor and vocal tics. There is undoubtedly basal ganglia involvement, which are also important for cognitive processes including performance monitoring and interference resolution. We investigated these functions in adult patients with GTS compared to healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: We compared a group of N = 23 adult patients with GTS to N = 27 HC on a flanker task during an EEG recording. Reaction times and error rates were recorded, as well as N2 and N(e)/ERN amplitudes. The N2 is an index of interference resolution. The N(e)/ERN is a negative fronto-central component, occurring when participants make mistakes. RESULTS: Patients' reaction times were enhanced on incongruent trials compared to HC. Electrophysiological data revealed more frontal components, as well as significantly increased N(e)/ERN amplitudes in patients with GTS compared to HC (p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Altered electrophysiological correlates of error processing in adult patients with GTS compared to HC cannot be attributed to differential error probabilities. Potentially, patients recruit compensatory resources from frontal networks to maintain behavioural performance.

However, besides drinking behavior, other recovery outcomes like physical and mental health-related quality of life are at least as important. The present study aimed to fill a research gap regarding the association of different impulsivity facets with health-related quality of life and well-being in alcohol use disorder. METHODS: Individuals with a primary alcohol use disorder diagnosis (n = 167) were interviewed with standardized self-report measures at the progressed stage of their withdrawal treatment and 6 weeks thereafter. Multiple regression models were calculated to examine the association of impulsivity, craving, and drinking patterns with health-related quality of life and well-being 6 weeks after withdrawal treatment, as well as the predictive role of impulsivity assessed during withdrawal for these two outcomes. RESULTS: Craving was associated with health-related quality of life and well-being 6 weeks after withdrawal. Likewise, non-planning and attentional impulsivity were associated with well-being 6 weeks after withdrawal. Motor impulsivity during withdrawal treatment predicted health-related quality of life 6 weeks thereafter. CONCLUSION: Impulsivity seems to be negatively related to health-related quality of life and well-being in the first weeks after alcohol withdrawal treatment, probably to a higher extent than drinking patterns, but differentiating between its facets seems to be important.

Patient survey on Invisalign((R)) treatment comparing [corrected] the SmartTrack((R)) material to the previously used [corrected] aligner material,"Brascher, A. K.; Zuran, D.; Feldmann, R. E., Jr.; Benrath, J.","OBJECTIVES: In 2013, a novel material SmartTrack((R)) was introduced to replace the previous material used for Invisalign((R)) aligners. We conducted this study to test how this transition was accepted by patients during ongoing Invisalign((R)) treatment. METHODS: We surveyed a total of 72 patients (68 % women, 32 % men, mean age: 29.3 +/- 9.2 years) who had worn the new material for a mean of 6 months. They completed a questionnaire with 25 items that compared both materials in terms of pain, pressure upon insertion, comfort, mucosal irritation, phonetics, discoloration, and taste. RESULTS: On a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, the new aligner material was rated by the respondents to cause significantly (p < 0.001) less maximum pain than the old material (2.8 vs. 3.8). Significant reductions were obtained for duration of pain (p < 0.001) and duration of pressure (2.5 vs. 1.9 days; p = 0.001) upon insertion of the aligners. Over 90 % of the respondents indicated less or equal pain during eating, felt that the new material offered a tighter fit, and provided more favorable ratings for impairment, durability, and discoloration. Improved comfort was reported by 50 % of the respondents.

[Patienten mit komorbiden somatischen und psychischen Erkrankungen haben ahnliche Fahigkeitsbeeintrachtigen wie Patienten mit psychischen Erkrankungen],"Muschalla, B.; Jobges, M.","OBJECTIVES: In patients with somatic illness and additional mental disorder, not only motor or sensory functions may be impaired, but also psychological capacities. These become more and more important for work ability in our modern working world. There are presently no data about the type and distribution of psychological capacity impairments in patients with comorbid somatic and mental disorders. These data are however important for estimation of diagnostic and therapy requirements. METHODS: 402 orthopedic, cardiological, and neurological patients with additional mental disorders were investigated with a structured clinical assessment for mental disorders (MINI) and psychological capacity impairments (Mini-ICF-APP). RESULTS: In all three somatic indications at least half of the comorbid patients had any clinically relevant psychological capacity impairment. Neurological patients (67%) and orthopedic patients (72%) were more often affected than cardiological patients (50.5%). Orthopedic patients are slightly more impaired in self-care; neurological and orthopedic patients are more impaired in mobility; and cardiological patients are less impaired in assertiveness. CONCLUSION: In comparison of all three somatic patient groups with mental disorders the number of psychological capacity impairments is similar. In contrast to patients with mental disorders only (i. e. those without somatic comorbidity), the psychological impairment quality in comorbid patients may be influenced by the somatic illness.

"Empathy, compassion, and theory of mind in obsessive-compulsive disorder","Salazar Kampf, M.; Kanske, P.; Kleiman, A.; Haberkamp, A.; Glombiewski, J.; Exner, C.","OBJECTIVES: Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often suffer from impairments in social functioning. This study investigates differences in empathy, compassion, and Theory of Mind (ToM) in individuals with OCD as a possible cause for social functioning deficits. DESIGN: Sixty-four individuals diagnosed with OCD and 62 healthy individuals completed a naturalistic behavioural task (EmpaToM) and a self-report measure (Interpersonal Reactivity Index, IRI). METHODS: Three preregistered repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs). RESULTS: People with OCD exhibited higher empathy levels - namely increased sharing of others' suffering - in the EmpaToM task and reported more distress (IRI) compared with healthy individuals. Furthermore, no differences in compassion (EmpaToM) between both groups emerged, although people with OCD reported more concern for others (IRI) compared with healthy individuals. Concerning the ToM, no group differences were detected, neither in the behavioural task, nor self-report. CONCLUSION: By investigating OCD with diverse scientific practices we shed light on the higher levels of empathy exhibited by individuals with OCD, which are relevant for clinical practice and our understanding of OCD symptomatology. PRACTITIONER POINTS: ●People with obsessive-compulsive disorder show higher levels of empathy, that is the increased sharing of others' suffering, compared with healthy individuals in both a traditional self-report and a naturalistic task. ●Regarding compassion, that is caring for others, their self-reported compassion was higher in people with OCD. ●In Theory of Mind, that is cognitively understanding the situation of another person, no differences have been found neither at self-report nor in a naturalistic task compared with healthy individuals. ●Independent of traditional interventions, it could prove useful to improve emotion regulation skills so people with OCD learn to cope with empathic distress.

L.; Pieske, B.; Wachter, R.; Edelmann, F.","OBJECTIVES: It has been postulated that patients with heart failure have a high risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death resulting from anxiety-induced autonomic arousal. In the prospective and multicenter DIAST-CHF (Diagnostic Trial on Prevalence and Clinical Course of Diastolic Dysfunction and Heart Failure) study, we therefore, tested the hypothesis that adrenomedullin (ADM), a well-established predictor for cardiovascular outcome, is associated with self-rated anxiety symptoms in patients at risk of suffering from or actually with overt heart failure. PARTICIPANTS AND MEASURES: Study participants with risk factors for diastolic dysfunction were requested to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and plasma mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) concentrations were measured. RESULTS: In bivariate analysis, we found significantly lower plasma MR-proADM levels in patients with elevated HADS-anxiety scores above the clinically relevant cut-off level of >/=11 (n=118, 536pmol/l, interquartile range [IQR] 449-626) as compared to non-anxious study participants (n=1,292, 573pmol/l, IQR 486-702, p=0.001). A set of multivariate models adjusted for potential confounders confirmed the negative association between self-rated anxiety symptoms and plasma MR-proADM. In similar models, no significant association was detected between HADS-depression scores and MR-proADM. CONCLUSIONS: The inverse relationship between plasma MR-proADM and anxiety observed in patients with cardiovascular risk factors supports a previous experimental study using a mutant mouse line with a brain-specific loss of ADM expression which displayed hyperactive and over-anxious behavior. Further experimental and clinical studies are warranted to test the hypothesis that also in humans ADM acts as a neuromodulator with anxiolytic properties.",2015,Dec,Psychoneuroendocrinology,62,,227-32,26342564.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.08.007,,#1497,Meyer 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Identifying CBT non-response among OCD outpatients: A machine-learning approach,"Hilbert, K.; Jacobi, T.; Kunas, S.

However, few studies tested the utility of easy to acquire and low-cost sociodemographic and clinical data. In previous work, we reported significant predictions still insufficient for immediate clinical use in a sample with broad diagnostic spectrum. We here examined whether predictions will improve in a diagnostically more homogeneous yet large and naturalistic obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sample. Methods: We used sociodemographic and clinical data routinely acquired during CBT treatment of n = 533 OCD subjects in a specialized outpatient clinic. Results: Remission was predicted with 65% (p = 0.001) balanced accuracy on unseen data for the best model. Higher OCD symptom severity predicted non-remission, while higher age of onset of first OCD symptoms and higher socioeconomic status predicted remission. For dimensional change, prediction achieved r = 0.31 (p = 0.001) between predicted and actual values. Conclusions: The comparison with our previous work suggests that predictions within a diagnostically homogeneous sample, here OCD, are not per se superior to a more diverse sample including several diagnostic groups.

METHODS: In 20 female MDD patients and 24 non-depressed women, circulating levels of CRP, IL-6, cortisol, selected endocannabinoids (ECs; anandamide [AEA], 2-arachidonylglycerol [2-AG]), and N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), as well as circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) were measured. RESULTS: We found higher serum CRP and plasma AEA levels in MDD and a positive association of CRP and AEA levels with current depressive symptoms. Blood levels of cortisol, ccf-mtDNA, 2-AG, and NAEs did depend on MDD diagnosis nor correlated with the severity of current depressive symptoms. CRP correlated positively with AEA, and AEA showed positive associations with 2-AG and NAE levels.

Thus, we used a large population-based sample with total testosterone (TT) and androstenedione (ASD) concentrations measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. DESIGN: Data of 2140 individuals (mean age: 60,8 years) from the cohort Study of Health in Pomerania were assessed at baseline and 5-year follow-up.

We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between GAD, SAD and MDD with saliva and hair cortisol as well as hair cortisol change in a population-based sample of adolescents and young adults, considering relevant co-factors. DESIGN: Epidemiological cohort study in Dresden, Germany. Data of 1050 individuals (mean age: 17.2 years) assessed at baseline (11/2015-12/2016) and of 605 individuals assessed at 1-year follow-up (FU1) are used. METHODS: Multivariable regression models were implemented to assess cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of DSM-5 defined 12-month diagnoses of GAD, SAD, and MDD, with short-term (saliva cortisol: cortisol awakening response (CAR) and area under the curve (AUC) as total cortisol) and long-term (hair cortisol) cortisol indices. Multivariable models were adjusted for age or ""tanner"" stage, waist circumference, tobacco and alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and hair cortisol dependent confounder. Sex-specific analyses were additionally conducted. RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses revealed positive associations between SAD and baseline saliva cortisol in multivariable models (CAR: beta-coefficient: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.01; 0.23) but could not be confirmed after adjusting for ""tanner"" stage or comorbid depression. Cross-sectional analyses concerning GAD and MDD in the full baseline sample yielded no significant associations.

Self-management training vs. neurofeedback interventions for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Results of a randomized controlled treatment study,"Korfmacher, A. K.; Hirsch, O.; Chavanon, M. L.; Albrecht, B.; Christiansen, H.","OBJECTIVES: Neurofeedback (NF) and self-management training (SMT) may be viable treatment options for patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) if they alleviate core symptoms, enhance the patients' self-concept and improve their quality of life (QoL). Aim of the current study is evaluating both interventions accordingly and to test whether specific improvements in core symptoms lead to more general improvements in self-concept and QoL. METHODS: In a psychotherapeutic outpatient clinic in Germany, a total of N = 139 children with ADHD were screened for eligibility, of which 111 fulfilled inclusion criteria and participated in the study in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 statement. These were randomly assigned to NF vs. SMT interventions. Changes from pre- to post-intervention in core ADHD symptoms relying on parent and teacher reports (CONNERS 3) and objective tests (Qb-Test) as well as self-concept (interview with the children) and QoL assessments (using the KINDL-R self-report) were compared between patients receiving NF or SMT. RESULTS: Significant improvements in ADHD symptoms were achieved similarly in both treatment groups, whilst QoL and self-concept improved after SMT only. CONCLUSION: This treatment study provides further evidence that SMT and NF may reduce core symptoms, but SMT may also improve patients' self-concept and QoL and may thus in its current form be the favorable treatment option in naturalistic settings. However, several limitations of the current study implicate that further research is required before definitive conclusions and recommendations for clinical practice can be given.

Reduced pleasant touch appraisal in the presence of a disgusting odor,"Croy, I.; Angelo, S. D.; Olausson, H.","OBJECTIVES: Odors are powerful emotional stimuli influencing mood, attention and behavior. Here we examined if odors change the perception of pleasant touch. In line with the warning function of the olfactory system, we proposed that especially unpleasant odors will reduce touch pleasantness, presumably through a disgust-related mechanism. METHODS: Forty-five healthy participants (mean age 23.3 +/- 3years SD, 24 females) were presented to slow (3 cm/s) and fast (30 cm/s) brush stroking delivered by a robot to the forearm. Touch pleasantness under the influence of an unpleasant odor (Civette, smelling like feces) and an intensity matched pleasant odor (Rose) was compared to an odorless control condition. In a pilot study with 30 participants (mean age 25.9 +/-6 years, 21 females), the odors were matched according to their intensity, and we studied the influence of disgust sensitivity on the perception of 4 different odor qualities. RESULTS: The unpleasant odor decreased touch pleasantness for both stroking velocities compared to the odorless control (p<0.005) whereas the rose odor did not change touch pleasantness significantly. Disgust sensitivity was correlated with the modulation of touch pleasantness. The pilot study revealed a significant correlation between disgust sensitivity and the perception of the unpleasant odor qualities (r = -0.56; p = 0.007), but not with any of the other odors.

Exploring the path of persisting dysfunctional expectations-Development of the immunization scale IMS,"Ewen, A. I.; Rief, W.; Wilhelm, M.","OBJECTIVES: Persistent dysfunctional expectations seem to be core features of mental disorders. The aim of this study was to develop a questionnaire that assesses mechanisms responsible for the consistency of dysfunctional expectations. Processes before (i.e., assimilation) and after (i.e., immunization) expectation-violating experiences have been considered. DESIGN: The Immunization Scale (IMS) is constructed and validated with the help of an explorative (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in two conducted studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the first study, the initially formulated 75-item version was completed online by 230 (range 18-69) participants from a convenience sample. For the second study, 299 (range 18-62) participants completed the reduced scale at the first measurement point, 75 participants thereof also 1 month later. For validity and reliability analyses, participants in both studies provided demographic information, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Depressive Expectation Scale (DES), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the German version of the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (FAH-II). RESULTS: The initial 75 items were reduced to 23 items. The EFA revealed three main factors, namely, negative expectations, assimilation, and cognitive immunization. The three-factor structure could be confirmed in study 2 by the CFA. Reliability measures showed an excellent internal consistency for the entire IMS. A very good test-retest reliability was found. Significant correlations resulted between the IMS and DES, BDI-II, BAI, and FAH-II, the highest for DES and FAH-II. CONCLUSION: Psychometric properties of the IMS are promising.

Bidirectional relationship of stress and affect with physical activity and healthy eating,"Schultchen, D.; Reichenberger, J.; Mittl, T.; Weh, T. R. M.; Smyth, J. M.; Blechert, J.; Pollatos, O.","OBJECTIVES: Physical activity and healthy eating seem to be protective against experiencing stress and negative affect as well as increase positive affect. At the same time, previous studies showed that people reduce salutogenic behaviours such as physical activity and healthy eating in the face of stress and negative affect while increasing such behaviours in the context of positive affect. Due to daily fluctuations of these behaviours, the present study examined these relationships in daily life using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-one university students responded to six daily prompts during 7 days via smartphone-based EMA. Items examined stress, emotional experience, physical activity duration, and healthy eating. RESULTS: Higher stress and negative affect, as well as lower positive affect, were related to a reduction in subsequent physical activity. Higher physical activity levels, in turn, were associated with less subsequent stress and negative affect, as well as more positive affect. No such effects for stress and affect on healthy eating or vice versa were found. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in physical activity is related to better mood and less stress/negative affect over the next several hours in daily life. Prevention efforts therefore may benefit by focusing on promoting physical activity, particularly when stress/negative affect is high to 'break the cycle' of inactivity, stress, and negative affect. Potential effects of healthy eating might be more subtle and characterized by interindividual differences or state effects. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Physical activity can reduce stress as well as negative emotions and can enhance positive emotions. People tend to eat less healthy food during stressful times, and healthy eating can increase general health. Physical activity and healthy eating have been mostly assessed separately and through retrospective methods. What does this study add? This is an EMA study investigating bidirectional effects of stress, emotions, and salutogenic behaviour. After physical activity, people felt less stressed/negative and more positive; feeling better and less stressed resulted in more physical activity. Healthy eating was not associated with stress or emotion level and vice versa.",2019,May,Br J Health Psychol,24,2,315-333,30672069.0,10.1111/bjhp.12355,,#1507,Schultchen 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Testing Bayesian models of belief updating in the context of depressive symptomatology,"Feldmann, M.; Kube, T.; Rief, W.; Brakemeier, E. L.","OBJECTIVES: Predictive processing approaches to belief updating in depression propose that depression is related to more negative and more precise priors. Also, belief updating is assumed be negatively biased in comparison to normative Bayesian updating. There is a lack of efficient methods to mathematically model belief updating in depression. METHODS: We validated a novel performance belief updating paradigm in a nonclinical sample (N = 133). Participants repeatedly participated in a non-self-related emotion recognition task and received false feedback. Effects of the feedback manipulation and differences in depressive symptoms on belief updating were analysed in Bayesian multilevel analyses. RESULTS: Beliefs were successfully manipulated through the feedback provided. Depressive symptoms were associated with more negative updating than normative Bayesian updating but results were influenced by few cases. No evidence of biased change in beliefs or overly precise priors was found. Depressive symptoms were associated with more negative updating of generalised performance beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: There was cautious support for negatively biased belief updating associated with depressive symptoms, especially for generalised beliefs. The content of the task may not be self-relevant enough to cause strong biases. Further explication of Bayesian models of depression and replication in clinical samples is needed.",2022,Sep 17,Int J Methods Psychiatr Res,,,e1946,36114811.0,10.1002/mpr.1946,,#1508,Feldmann 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Effects of psychosocial stress and performance feedback on pain processing and its correlation with subjective and neuroendocrine parameters,"Schneider, S. K.; Pauli, P.; Lautenbacher, S.; Reicherts, P.","OBJECTIVES: Previous research on stress-induced pain modulation suggests that moderate psychological stress usually leads to hyperalgesia while more severe threat results in hypoalgesia. However, existing studies often lack suitable control conditions imperative to identify mere stress effects. Similarly, research mainly focused on pure anticipation of a social threat, not taking into consideration actual experiences of social evaluation. Therefore, we set out to investigate actual social up- and downgrading combined with a standardized stress paradigm to evaluate short-term and prolonged changes in pain perception and their potential association with neuroendocrine and subjective stress parameters. METHODS: We allocated 177 healthy women to four experimental conditions, either the standard version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) followed by positive, negative or no performance feedback, or a well-matched but less demanding placebo version of the TSST. Stress responses were assessed with ratings, salivary alpha-amylase, and salivary cortisol. To capture putative effects of stress on pain, heat pain threshold, ratings of phasic heat pain stimuli, and conditioned pain modulation were measured. RESULTS: Despite a largely successful stress induction, results do not support a reliable influence of experimentally induced social stress-with or without subsequent performance feedback-on pain in women. Further, we found no clear association of pain modulation and changes in neuroendocrine or subjective stress responses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contrast previous studies, which repeatedly demonstrated stress-induced hypo- or hyperalgesia. This might be due to methodological reasons as former research was often characterized by high heterogeneity regarding the applied stressors, low sample sizes, and lacking or inconclusive control conditions. Thus, our results raise the question whether pain modulation in women by experimental psychosocial stress might have been overestimated in the past. Future research is necessary, which should employ parametric stress induction methods including well-matched control tasks, taking into consideration the participants' gender/sex and the time course of the stress response relative to pain assessment.

Reduced embodied simulation in psychopathy,"Mier, D.; Haddad, L.; Diers, K.; Dressing, H.; Meyer-Lindenberg, A.; Kirsch, P.","OBJECTIVES: Psychopathy is characterized by severe deficits in emotion processing and empathy. These emotional deficits might not only affect the feeling of own emotions, but also the understanding of others' emotional and mental states. The present study aims on identifying the neurobiological correlates of social-cognitive related alterations in psychopathy. METHODS: We applied a social-cognitive paradigm for the investigation of face processing, emotion recognition, and affective Theory of Mind (ToM) to 11 imprisoned psychopaths and 18 healthy controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure task-related brain activation. RESULTS: While showing no overall behavioural deficit, psychopathy was associated with altered brain activation. Psychopaths had reduced fusiform activation related to face processing. Related to affective ToM, psychopaths had hypoactivation in amygdala, inferior prefrontal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus, areas associated with embodied simulation of emotions and intentions. Furthermore, psychopaths lacked connectivity between superior temporal sulcus and amygdala during affective ToM. CONCLUSIONS: These results replicate findings of alterations in basal face processing in psychopathy. In addition, they provide evidence for reduced embodied simulation in psychopathy in concert with a lack of communication between motor areas and amygdala which might provide the neural substrate of reduced feeling with others during social cognition.",2014,Aug,World J Biol Psychiatry,15,6,479-87,24802075.0,10.3109/15622975.2014.902541,,#1510,Mier 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Psychoanalytic Techniques in Different Psychoanalytically Oriented Psychotherapies - An Analysis of Therapists' Self-Reports,"Henkel, M.; Zimmermann, J.; Benecke, C.","OBJECTIVES: Psychotherapy approaches based on psychoanalytic thinking which also modify standard technique are on the rise. Despite various theoretical considerations, empirical research seldom inspected concepts of practicing therapists concerning technique in different psychoanalytically oriented approaches. METHODS: In an online survey, 124 German psychoanalysts and psychodynamic therapists described their technique on a Psychoanalytic Technique Questionnaire in 295 therapy phases, subjectively assessed as good, of four therapy approaches varying in setting and duration. RESULTS: Factor analysis extracted three therapeutic strategies: a classic, a clarifying, and a supportive technique. Linear mixed model analyses showed that, in therapies with a lower frequency of sessions and face-to-face setting as well as in shorter therapies, classic technique was less often and supportive technique more often used. CONCLUSIONS: Therapists' concepts of different psychoanalytically oriented approaches mostly agree with theoretical assumptions.

Deceptive and Nondeceptive Placebos to Reduce Pain: An Experimental Study in Healthy Individuals,"Kube, T.; Rief, W.; Vivell, M. B.; Schafer, N. L.; Vermillion, T.; Korfer, K.; Glombiewski, J. A.","OBJECTIVES: Recent research has shown that placebos can be effective even if they are openly prescribed to participants. Yet, it is unclear how such ""open-label placebos"" (OLPs) compare to deceptive placebo (DP) and what the mechanisms of actions are. In this study, we therefore compared 2 versions of OLP to DP and no treatment (NT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a standard heat pain paradigm, 117 healthy volunteers underwent a baseline and a posttreatment pain assessment. With the exception of NT, all groups received an inert placebo cream after the first assessment. OLP was administered by either evoking positive expectancies or by raising hope for placebo analgesia, thus distinguishing for the first time conceptually between expectancy and hope in experimental pain research. The primary outcome was pre-post change in pain tolerance. RESULTS: Increase in pain tolerance was larger in the 3 treatment groups compared with NT, whereas the treatment groups did not differ from each other. Further results showed that participants receiving DP reported a large reduction of subjective pain intensity and unpleasantness, whereas no such reduction was found for the 2 OLP groups. The 2 OLP versions did not differ in terms of their analgesic effects. DISCUSSION: The study provided evidence for traditional placebo analgesia on the basis of deception. For OLP, we found that OLP indeed increased pain tolerance; however, participants receiving OLP were reluctant to report any subjective analgesic effects. Combined with previous studies, the present findings suggest that the effects of OLP are weaker in healthy volunteers than in clinical samples.",2020,Feb,Clin J Pain,36,2,68-79,31899746.0,10.1097/AJP.0000000000000781,,#1512,Kube 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype affects age-related changes in plasticity in working memory: a pilot study,"Heinzel, S.; Riemer, T. G.; Schulte, S.; Onken, J.; Heinz, A.; Rapp, M. A.","OBJECTIVES: Recent work suggests that a genetic variation associated with increased dopamine metabolism in the prefrontal cortex (catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met; COMT) amplifies age-related changes in working memory performance. Research on younger adults indicates that the influence of dopamine-related genetic polymorphisms on working memory performance increases when testing the cognitive limits through training. To date, this has not been studied in older adults. METHOD: Here we investigate the effect of COMT genotype on plasticity in working memory in a sample of 14 younger (aged 24-30 years) and 25 older (aged 60-75 years) healthy adults. Participants underwent adaptive training in the n-back working memory task over 12 sessions under increasing difficulty conditions. RESULTS: Both younger and older adults exhibited sizeable behavioral plasticity through training (P < .001), which was larger in younger as compared to older adults (P < .001). Age-related differences were qualified by an interaction with COMT genotype (P < .001), and this interaction was due to decreased behavioral plasticity in older adults carrying the Val/Val genotype, while there was no effect of genotype in younger adults. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that age-related changes in plasticity in working memory are critically affected by genetic variation in prefrontal dopamine metabolism.",2014,,Biomed Res Int,2014,,414351,24772423.0,10.1155/2014/414351,,#1514,Heinzel 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Neural response during anticipation of monetary loss is elevated in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Wilbertz, G.; Delgado, M. R.; Tebartz Van Elst, L.; Maier, S.; Philipsen, A.; Blechert, J.","OBJECTIVES: Risky behaviour seriously impacts the life of adult patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Such behaviours have often been attributed to their exaggerated reward seeking, but dysfunctional anticipation of negative outcomes might also play a role. METHODS: The present study compared adult patients with ADHD (n = 28) with matched healthy controls (n = 28) during anticipation of monetary losses versus gains while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and skin conductance recording. RESULTS: Skin conductance was higher during anticipation of losses compared to gains in both groups. Affective ratings of predictive cues did not differ between groups. ADHD patients showed increased activity in bilateral amygdalae, left anterior insula (region of interest analysis) and left temporal pole (whole brain analysis) compared to healthy controls during loss versus gain anticipation. In the ADHD group higher insula and temporal pole activations went along with more negative affective ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Neural correlates of loss anticipation are not blunted but rather increased in ADHD, possibly due to a life history of repeated failures and the respective environmental sanctions. Behavioural adaptations to such losses, however, might differentiate them from controls: future research should study whether negative affect might drive more risk seeking than risk avoidance.",2017,Jun,World J Biol Psychiatry,18,4,268-278,26508322.0,10.3109/15622975.2015.1112032,,#1515,Wilbertz 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

This makes short versions of field-tested approaches such as the OPD Structure Questionnaire (OPD-SQ) necessary. METHODS: With the aim of developing a screening version, the original sample of the OPD-SQ was divided into two subsamples. After developing a preliminary 12-item version in one subsample, we used confirmatory factor-analysis in the second subsample as well as an independent sample to test the factor structure. RESULTS: The analyses confirmed a structure of three correlating factors with adequate fit indices. Other findings relating to the validity of the long version were replicated as well. In addition, data from an independent sample of psychotherapy inpatients confirmed the factor structure and provided further evidence for its validity.

Effects of a video intervention on physicians' acceptance of pain apps: a randomised controlled trial,"Hein, H. J.; Glombiewski, J. A.; Rief, W.; Riecke, J.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine and enhance physicians' acceptance, performance expectancy and credibility of health apps for chronic pain patients. We further investigated predictors of acceptance. DESIGN: Randomised experimental trial with a parallel-group repeated measures design. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 248 physicians working in various, mainly outpatient settings in Germany. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Physicians were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (short video about health apps) or a control group (short video about chronic pain). Primary outcome measure was acceptance. Performance expectancy and credibility of health apps were secondary outcomes. In addition, we assessed 101 medical students to evaluate the effectiveness of the video intervention in young professionals. RESULTS: In general, physicians' acceptance of health apps for chronic pain patients was moderate (M=9.51, SD=3.53, scale ranges from 3 to 15). All primary and secondary outcomes were enhanced by the video intervention: A repeated-measures analysis of variance yielded a significant interaction effect for acceptance (F(1, 246)=15.28, p=0.01), performance expectancy (F(1, 246)=6.10, p=0.01) and credibility (F(1, 246)=25.61, p<0.001). The same pattern of results was evident among medical students. Linear regression analysis revealed credibility (beta=0.34, p<0.001) and performance expectancy (beta=0.30, p<0.001) as the two strongest factors influencing acceptance, followed by scepticism (beta=-0.18, p<0.001) and intuitive appeal (beta=0.11, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Physicians' acceptance of health apps was moderate, and was strengthened by a 3 min video. Besides performance expectancy, credibility seems to be a promising factor associated with acceptance.

Predictors of outcome of an Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in older adults,"Bottche, M.; Kuwert, P.; Pietrzak, R. H.; Knaevelsrud, C.","OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of resource-oriented variables such as self-efficacy, locus of control (LOC) and post-traumatic growth (PTG) in predicting treatment response in older adults with post-traumatic stress. METHODS: Fifty-eight older adults with subsyndromal or greater severity of war-associated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms completed a randomized controlled Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) with immediate and delayed treatment groups. Assessments of PTSD severity and resource-oriented variables of self-efficacy, LOC and PTG were conducted at baseline, post-treatment and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Results revealed that pre-treatment scores on measures of internal LOC and PTG predicted PTSD symptom severity at post-treatment, even after controlling for initial PTSD. At a 6-month follow-up, internal LOC continued to predict PTSD symptom severity. In addition, repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed that, relative to older adults with low internal LOC and PTG, older adults with high internal LOC and PTG, respectively, did not differ with respect to initial PTSD severity, but they showed a more pronounced response to treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that greater locus of control and post-traumatic growth is associated with greater improvement in PTSD symptoms following Internet-based CBT. Assessment of these constructs may be useful in identifying trauma survivors who are most likely to respond to CBT. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Greater internal locus of control and post-traumatic growth is associated with greater improvement in PTSD symptoms following Internet-based CBT. Older adults with initial high internal locus of control and post-traumatic growth, respectively, did not differ with respect to initial PTSD severity, but they showed a more pronounced response to treatment. It could be assumed that patients with initial functional appraisals could benefit easier and faster from a trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy compared to individuals with lower internal locus of control and post-traumatic growth.",2016,Mar,Psychol Psychother,89,1,82-96,26234801.0,10.1111/papt.12069,,#1518,Bottche 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

A.; Guethoff, S.","OBJECTIVES: The incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in premenopausal women is comparatively low, but increases sharply after menopause. The principal aim of this study was to determine whether women with ascending aortic disease (AAD) have a different reproductive history from that of an age-matched control group. METHODS: In this retrospective study, women who had undergone ascending aortic aneurysm (AscAA) repair between 2000 and 2010 were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning risk factors and reproductive history. Data from 142 women with AAD were evaluated, and a subgroup (n = 64) with AscAA >/=5 cm was analyzed and compared to an age-matched random control group without known aortic diseases. RESULTS: Almost all women were menopausal at the time of the questionnaire (98.4% vs. 90.6%, AscAA >/=5 cm subcohort vs. control, p = 0.12) and all subjects presented with a comparable age of menarche (13.7 +/- 2.6 years vs. 14.2 +/- 1.8 years, AscAA >/=5 cm subcohort vs. control, log-rank 0.04, p = 0.84). However, mean menopausal age was significantly lower in the case subcohort than in controls (48.1 +/- 4.8 years vs. 50.6 +/- 5.8 years, AscAA >/=5 cm subcohort vs. control, log-rank 8.35, p = 0.004), and reproductive life span was correspondingly shorter (34.2 +/- 5.2 years vs. 36.2 +/- 5.7 years, p = 0.04). Furthermore, hypertension was more prevalent in women with AscAA >/=5 cm compared to controls (89.1% vs. 61.9%, AscAA >/=5 cm subcohort vs. control, p < 0.001).

The study further aimed at quantifying the differences in subjective workload between the auditory and the visual P300 spelling application. The influence of workload, mood and motivation on BCI performance and P300 amplitude was investigated. METHODS: Twenty healthy participants performed auditory and visual spelling tasks in an EEG experiment with online feedback. RESULTS: Sixteen of twenty participants performed at or above a level necessary for satisfactory communication (>/=70% spelling accuracy) with the auditory BCI. Average bit rates of up to 2.76 bits/min (best subject 7.43 bits/min) were achieved. A significantly higher workload was reported for the auditory speller compared to the visual paradigm.

METHODS: Participants indicating that attendance of F2F-CBT was possible were assigned to F2F-CBT (n = 49). F2F-CBT consisted of 12 sessions over 6 months. Effects were evaluated at posttest and 6-month follow-up on a variety of outcomes relative to usual care (CG; n = 134). RESULTS: At posttest, F2F-CBT yielded significantly fewer symptoms of depression (d = 0.37), better emotional well-being (d = 0.64), and better coping with the care situation (d = 0.52) than CG. At 6-month follow-up, the effect on emotional well-being was retained (d = 0.44) and social relationships were rated significantly better in F2F-CBT than CG (d = 0.34).

Observing physicians acting with different levels of empathy modulates later assessed pain tolerance,"Kathner, I.; Eidel, M.; Hage, A. S.; Gram, A.; Pauli, P.","OBJECTIVES: The patient-physician relationship is essential for treatment success. Previous studies demonstrated that physicians who behave empathic in their interaction with patients have a positive effect on health outcomes. In this study, we investigated if the mere perception of physicians as empathic/not empathic modulates pain despite an emotionally neutral interaction with the patients. METHODS: N = 60 women took part in an experimental study that simulated a clinical interaction. In the paradigm, each participant watched two immersive 360 degrees videos via a head-mounted display from a patient's perspective. The physicians in the videos behaved either empathic or not empathic towards a third person. Importantly, these physicians remained emotionally neutral in the subsequent virtual interaction with the participants. Finally, participants received a controlled, painful pressure stimulus within the narratives of the videos. RESULTS: The physicians in the high compared with the low empathy videos were rated as more empathic and more likable, indicating successful experimental manipulation. In spite of later neutral behaviour of physicians, this short observation of physicians' behaviour towards a third person was sufficient to modulate pain tolerance of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of this study that the mere observation of physicians' behaviour towards a third person modulates pain, despite a neutral direct interaction with the participants, has important clinical implications. Further, the proposed paradigm enables investigating aspects of patient-physician communication that are difficult to examine in a clinical setting.",2022,May,Br J Health Psychol,27,2,434-448,34374180.0,10.1111/bjhp.12553,,#1523,Kathner 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Patients were then split into two groups, depending on a positive or negative result on the FA screening. Analysis of variance was used to compare means between the two groups. Stepwise binary logistic regression was used to obtain a predictive model for the presence of FA. RESULTS: Patients with FA had lower self-directedness, and more negative urgency and lack of perseverance than patients not reporting addictive eating.

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as a Standalone Intervention for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Mixed Traumatic Events: A Mixed-Methods Feasibility Study,"Muller-Engelmann, M.; Wunsch, S.; Volk, M.; Steil, R.","Objectives: There is promising evidence that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in reducing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, until now, studies have often lacked a full clinical PTSD assessment, and interventions are often administered in addition to other interventions. This study examined the feasibility of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) as a standalone intervention in patients with PTSD who have experienced mixed traumatic events. Method: Fourteen patients participated in 8 weeks of MBSR. The patients were assessed prior to treatment, post-treatment and at a 1-month follow-up through self-ratings (e.g., the Davidson Trauma Scale) and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale to determine the effects of the intervention. Furthermore, after the intervention, the patients participated in qualitative interviews regarding their experiences with MBSR and their ideas for future improvements. Results: Nine patients finished the program, and these patients considered the exercises to be applicable and helpful. In the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, we found large effects regarding the reduction of PTSD symptoms among completers (Cohen's d = 1.2). In the Davidson Trauma Scale, the effect sizes were somewhat lower (Cohen's d = 0.6) but nevertheless confirmed the efficacy of MBSR in reducing PTSD symptoms. In the qualitative interviews, the patients reported an augmentation of wellbeing and improvement regarding the handling of difficult situations and more distance from the traumatic event. Conclusion: Despite the large effects, the high dropout rates and the results of the post-treatment interviews suggest that the intervention should be better adapted to the needs of PTSD patients, e.g., by giving more information regarding the exercises and by including shorter exercises to manage acute distress.",2017,2017/09/05,Front Psychol,8,,1407,28928678.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01407,,#1527,Muller-Engelmann 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Sleep disturbances and mental strain in university students: results from an online survey in Luxembourg and Germany,"Schlarb, A. A.; Classen, M.; Grunwald, J.; Vogele, C.","OBJECTIVES: This study examined the prevalence of sleep disturbances and mental strain in students from two European countries, Luxembourg and Germany. METHODS: A total of 2831 students took part in an online survey, with 2777 students from Germany and 184 students from Luxembourg. Sleep disturbances were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and aspects of mental strain using the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Social-Interactive-Anxiety Scale, the self-efficacy questionnaire and the test anxiety questionnaire. In addition, we also assessed students' chronotypes. RESULTS: Across the whole sample mean scores on the sleep questionnaires were above the cut-off for clinically relevant sleep problems, indicating an increased prevalence of sleep disturbances in students from both countries. Sleep quality was impaired in 42.8%, and 17.9% showed clinically relevant scores. Overall 25.5% reported elevated depression and 13.3% social phobia symptoms, while 45% indicated elevated stress levels. Sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, chronotype, depression scores, stress levels, test anxiety, and self-efficacy differed significantly between men and women, but there were no differences between countries.

ACTonDiabetes-a guided psychological internet intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for adults living with type 1 or 2 diabetes: results of a randomised controlled feasibility trial,"Bendig, E.; Bauereiss, N.; Schmitt, A.; Albus, P.; Baumeister, H.","OBJECTIVES: This two-group randomised controlled trial evaluates the feasibility of an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based internet intervention for diabetes distress in people with diabetes type 1 or type 2. Participants were assigned to a guided self-help intervention (EG) or waitlist control group (CG). SETTING: Recruitment took place following an open recruitment strategy including different diabetes centres, self-help groups and social media platforms. PARTICIPANTS: Eligibility criteria comprised being 18 years of age or older, self-reported diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, internet access, sufficient German language skills and written informed consent. INTERVENTION: ACTonDiabetes is an internet-based and mobile-based intervention and comprises an introduction and seven modules (one module per week, processing time about 45-60 min). Intervention contents are based on ACT. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were assessed before and 8 weeks after randomisation. Primary outcome was feasibility (trial recruitment, acceptability). Potential group differences in diabetes distress and other outcomes at follow-up were analysed using linear regression models with baseline values as predictors. All analyses were based on an intention-to-treat principle, potential negative effects were analysed on per-protocol basis. RESULTS: From October 2017 to April 2018, N=42 people with diabetes consented and were randomised (EG n=21, CG n=21). Forty-three per cent of the EG completed all treatment modules within 8 weeks. Across modules, formative user feedback revealed that contents could be optimised regarding comprehensibility (34%), individualisation (20%) and text amount (21%). Overall, 57% of participants dropped out prior to full treatment completion. There were reductions of diabetes distress in the EG (d=0.65, p=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Modifications of the intervention content according to the user feedback will be performed to further improve acceptability. Mechanisms to foster intervention adherence should be considered for lowering the attrition rate. ACTonDiabetes is feasible for the implementation in a confirmatory trial.

Internet-Delivered Cognitive-Behavior Therapy for Tinnitus: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Weise, C.; Kleinstauber, M.; Andersson, G.","OBJECTIVES: Tinnitus has a substantially negative impact on quality of life in up to 5% of the general population. Internet-based cognitive-behavioral treatment (iCBT) has been shown to be effective in a few trials. The aim of our study was to investigate iCBT for tinnitus by using a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients with severe tinnitus-related distress were randomly assigned to therapist-guided iCBT (n = 62) or to a moderated online discussion forum (n = 62). Standardized self-report measures for tinnitus-related distress (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Mini-Tinnitus Questionnaire) and associated symptoms (tinnitus acceptance, anxiety, depression, and insomnia) were assessed at pretreatment and posttreatment, 6-month-, and 1-year follow-up. Clinical significance was assessed with the Reliable Change Index. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses of variance revealed significant main effects for time, group, and interaction in favor of the iCBT group. With regard to tinnitus-related distress, the significant univariate interaction effects (time by group) were supported by large effect sizes (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory: g = 0.83, 95% confidence interval = 0.47-1.20; Mini-Tinnitus Questionnaire: g = 1.08, 95% confidence interval = 0.71-1.64). For the secondary outcomes, significant interactions with small to medium effect sizes were found. Within-group effects for the iCBT, from pretreatment to follow-up, were substantial in regard to tinnitus-related distress (1.38 </= d </= 1.81) and small to large for secondary outcomes (0.39 </= d </= 1.04). CONCLUSIONS: Using a randomized controlled trial design, we replicated prior findings regarding positive effects of Internet-delivered CBT on tinnitus-related distress and associated symptoms. Implementing iCBT for tinnitus into regular health care will be an important next step to increase access to treatment for patients with tinnitus.

METHODS: Data were collected from parents of 6-10-year-old children who were recruited from 22 public grammar schools in Germany. A total of 1537 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders were diagnosed on the basis of questionnaire responses by Rome III criteria. Further, somatic complaints as well as emotional and behavioral problems were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 7.7% of children aged 6-10 years fulfilled the criteria for at least one Rome III abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorder according to their parents. The most prevalent diagnoses were irritable bowel syndrome (4.9%) and functional abdominal pain (2.0%). Assigned diagnoses were not associated with sociodemographic factors. We could confirm that abdominal pain-related functional disorders, especially irritable bowel syndrome, were strongly associated with somatization and emotional problems in community.

Evidence of altered interhemispheric communication after pediatric concussion,"Schmidt, J.; Brown, K. E.; Feldman, S. J.; Babul, S.; Zwicker, J. G.; Boyd, L. A.","OBJECTIVES: To investigate neurophysiological alterations within the typical symptomatic period after concussion (1-month) and throughout recovery (6-months) in adolescents; and (2) to examine relationships between neurophysiological and upper limb kinematic outcomes.METHODS: 18 adolescents with concussion were compared to 17 healthy controls. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess neurophysiological differences between groups including: short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, short- and long-latency afferent inhibition, afferent facilitation, and transcallosal inhibition (TCI). Behavioral measures of upper limb kinematics were assessed with a robotic device.RESULTS: Mixed model analysis of neurophysiological data identified two key findings. First, participants with concussion demonstrated delayed onset of interhemispheric inhibition, as indexed by TCI, compared to healthy controls. Second, our exploratory analysis indicated that the magnitude of TCI onset delay in adolescents with concussion was related to upper limb kinematics.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that concussion in adolescence alters interhemispheric communication. We note relationships between neurophysiological and kinematic data, suggesting an affinity for individuals with less concussion-related physiological change to improve their motor behavior over time.

Effects of train noise and vibration on human heart rate during sleep: an experimental study,"Croy, I.; Smith, M. G.; Waye, K. P.","OBJECTIVES: Transportation of goods on railways is increasing and the majority of the increased numbers of freight trains run during the night. Transportation noise has adverse effects on sleep structure, affects the heart rate (HR) during sleep and may be linked to cardiovascular disease. Freight trains also generate vibration and little is known regarding the impact of vibration on human sleep. A laboratory study was conducted to examine how a realistic nocturnal railway traffic scenario influences HR during sleep. DESIGN: Case-control. SETTING: Healthy participants. PARTICIPANTS: 24 healthy volunteers (11 men, 13 women, 19-28 years) spent six consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. INTERVENTIONS: All participants slept during one habituation night, one control and four experimental nights in which train noise and vibration were reproduced. In the experimental nights, 20 or 36 trains with low-vibration or high-vibration characteristics were presented. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Polysomnographical data and ECG were recorded. RESULTS: The train exposure led to a significant change of HR within 1 min of exposure onset (p=0.002), characterised by an initial and a delayed increase of HR. The high-vibration condition provoked an average increase of at least 3 bpm per train in 79% of the participants. Cardiac responses were in general higher in the high-vibration condition than in the low-vibration condition (p=0.006). No significant effect of noise sensitivity and gender was revealed, although there was a tendency for men to exhibit stronger HR acceleration than women. CONCLUSIONS: Freight trains provoke HR accelerations during sleep, and the vibration characteristics of the trains are of special importance. In the long term, this may affect cardiovascular functioning of persons living close to railways.",2013,May 28,BMJ Open,3,5,e002655,23793667.0,10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002655,,#1535,Croy 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Treatment failure in cognitive-behavioural therapy: therapeutic alliance as a precondition for an adherent and competent implementation of techniques,"Weck, F.; Grikscheit, F.; Jakob, M.; Hofling, V.; Stangier, U.","OBJECTIVES: Treatment failure is a common phenomenon, but little is known about the reasons. Therapeutic alliance, therapist adherence, and therapist competence are considered important aspects of treatment success and formed the focus of the current investigation. DESIGN: Three randomized controlled trials for the treatment of depression, social phobia, and hypochondriasis were the basis of the current study. METHODS: The role of therapeutic alliance, as well as therapist adherence and competence, were investigated in 61 patients, which were classified either as treatment failure or as treatment success. Process variables were evaluated by independent raters on the basis of videotapes of the first three treatment sessions. RESULTS: Therapists' adherence and therapeutic alliance differed significantly between successful treatments and those classified as failures, whereas therapists' competence did not. In cross-sectional analysis, we found a moderating effect of adherence with alliance on treatment outcome, indicating that the better the therapeutic alliance, the stronger the effect of adherence on treatment outcome. Moreover, higher therapists' competence was found to affect treatment outcome positively, only mediated by therapeutic alliance. Higher therapists' adherence affected treatment outcome positively, only mediated by the competence-alliance relationship. In additional longitudinal analyses, we found evidence that the therapeutic alliance within one session influences therapists' adherence and competence in the subsequent session, but not the other way around. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic alliance proved to be an important variable for the prediction of treatment failure. Furthermore, in our longitudinal analyses, we found evidence that the therapeutic alliance is a precondition for the adherent and competent implementation of therapeutic techniques, which questions the results of our cross-sectional analysis and of previous research. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Clinical implications Treatment failure is associated with a lower therapeutic alliance in cognitive-behavioural treatment. Therapeutic alliance seems to be an important precondition for the adherent and competent implementation of therapeutic techniques. Therapeutic alliance should be monitored during psychotherapeutic treatment.

Does texting interrupt imitation learning in 19-month-old infants?,"Konrad, C.; Berger-Hanke, M.; Hassel, G.; Barr, R.","Observed disruptions to parent-child interactions during parental media use, such as texting, have been termed technoference. For example, when a language learning interaction was disrupted by a phone call, toddlers were less likely to acquire the word. Other studies demonstrated that parents often exhibit a still face while silently reading information on their cell phones. In the present study, the effect of a text interruption on infant imitation learning was examined. Parents demonstrated three target actions to their infants and then infants were given the opportunity to repeat those interactions. The actions were demonstrated four times. Text interruptions occurred before or between demonstrations. Performance of these groups was compared to a baseline control group where the infant did not see a demonstration of the target actions and a no-interruption group where the parents demonstrated the target actions four times without interruption. Parents were randomly assigned to three conditions, interruption-first condition, one-interruption condition, or three-interruptions condition. Infant behavior was measured during the interruptions. Across text interruption groups parents exhibited high levels of still face during the interruptions (77 %). However, infants in all 3 interruption groups performed significantly above the baseline control indicating learning despite the interruptions. Higher reported maternal reliance on the smartphone was related to poorer imitation performance overall. In contrast, when parents reported that they found it easier to multi-task infant imitation rates were higher. These findings indicate that infants can learn under conditions of brief technoference and that individual differences in family media ecology are associated with learning.",2021,Feb,Infant Behav Dev,62,,101513,33338985.0,10.1016/j.infbeh.2020.101513,,#1537,Konrad 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Neural correlates of feedback processing in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Endrass, T.; Koehne, S.; Riesel, A.; Kathmann, N.","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients show hyperactive performance monitoring when monitoring their own actions. Hyperactive performance monitoring is related to OCD symptomatology, like the unflexibility of compulsive behaviors, and was suggested as a potential endophenotype for the disorder. However, thus far the functioning of the performance monitoring system in OCD remains unclear in processes where performance is not monitored in one's own actions internally, but through external feedback during learning. The present study investigated whether electrocortical indicators of feedback processing are hyperactive, and whether feedback-guided learning is compromised in OCD. A modified deterministic four-choice object reversal learning task was used that required recurrent feedback-based behavioral adjustment in response to changing reward contingencies. Electrophysiological correlates of feedback processing (i.e. feedback-related negativity [FRN] and P300) were measured in 25 OCD patients and 25 matched healthy comparison subjects. Deficits in behavioral adjustment were found in terms of higher error rates of OCD patients in response to negative feedback. Whereas the FRN was unchanged for reversal negative feedback, it was reduced for negative feedback that indicated that a newly selected stimulus was still incorrect. The observed FRN reduction suggests attenuated monitoring of feedback during the learning process in OCD potentially contributing to a deficit in adaptive behavior reflected in obsessive thoughts and actions. The reduction of FRN amplitudes contrasts with overactive performance monitoring of self-generated errors. Nevertheless, the findings contribute to the theoretical framework of performance monitoring, suggesting a dissociation of processing systems for actions and feedback with specific alterations of these two systems in OCD.",2013,May,J Abnorm Psychol,122,2,387-96,23421527.0,10.1037/a0031496,,#1538,Endrass 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Reduced activity and connectivity of left amygdala in patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine or olanzapine,"Mier, D.; Schirmbeck, F.; Stoessel, G.; Esslinger, C.; Rausch, F.; Englisch, S.; Eisenacher, S.; de Haan, L.; Meyer-Lindenberg, A.; Kirsch, P.; Zink, M.","Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) in patients with schizophrenia are a common co-occurring condition, often associated with additional impairments. A subgroup of these patients develops OCS during treatment with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), most importantly clozapine and olanzapine. So far, little is known about possible neural mechanism of these SGAs, which seem to aggravate or induce OCS. To investigate the role of SGA treatment on neural activation and connectivity during emotional processing, patients were stratified according to their monotherapy into two groups (group I: clozapine or olanzapine, n = 20; group II: amisulpride or aripiprazole, n = 20). We used an fMRI approach, applying an implicit emotion recognition task. Group comparisons showed significantly higher frequency and severity of comorbid OCS in group I than group II. Task specific activation was attenuated in group I in the left amygdala. Furthermore, functional connectivity from left amygdala to right ventral striatum was reduced in group I. Reduced amygdala activation was associated with OCS severity. Recent literature suggests an involvement of an amygdala-cortico-striatal network in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The observed differential activation and connectivity pattern of the amygdala might thus indicate a neural mechanism for the development of SGA-associated OCS in patients with schizophrenia.

Offenders with antisocial personality disorder show attentional bias for violence-related stimuli,"Domes, G.; Mense, J.; Vohs, K.; Habermeyer, E.","Offenders with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) may be characterized by a lack in emotional functioning that manifests in irritability and a lack of remorse. The proposed link between ASPD and negative emotionality led to the question of emotional processing anomalies in ASPD. Furthermore, the effect of childhood maltreatment/abuse on emotional processing was tested in the present study. Violent and sexual offenders with ASPD (n=35), without ASPD (n=34), and healthy non-criminal controls (n=24) were compared in an Emotional Stroop Task (EST) using neutral, negative, and violence-related words. Secondary analyses focused on the effect of psychopathic traits and childhood maltreatment. Offenders with ASPD showed a stronger attentional bias to violence-related and negative words as compared to controls. Comparable results were obtained when grouping offenders to high, medium, and low psychopathic subgroups. Offenders with childhood maltreatment specifically showed stronger violence-related attentional bias than non-maltreated offenders. The data suggest that enhanced attention to violence-related stimuli in adult criminal offenders is associated with adverse developmental experiences and delinquency but to a lesser extent with antisocial or psychopathic traits.",2013,Aug 30,Psychiatry Res,209,1,78-84,23261185.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2012.11.005,,#1540,Domes 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Older adults' affective experiences across 100 days are less variable and less complex than younger adults',"Brose, A.; de Roover, K.; Ceulemans, E.; Kuppens, P.","Older adults are often described as being more emotionally competent than younger adults, and higher levels of affect complexity are seen as an indicator of this competence. We argue, however, that once age differences in affect variability are taken into account, older adults' everyday affective experiences will be characterized by lower affect complexity when compared with younger adults'. In addition, reduced affect complexity seems more likely from a theoretical point of view. We tested this hypothesis with a study in which younger and older adults reported their momentary affect on 100 days. Affect complexity was examined using clusterwise simultaneous component analysis based on covariance matrices to take into account differences in affect variability. We found that in the majority of older adults (55%), structures of affect were comparatively simpler than those of younger adults because they were reduced to a positive affect component. Most remaining older adults (35%) were characterized by differentiated rather than undifferentiated affective responding, as were a considerable number of younger adults (43%). When affect variability was made comparable across age groups, affect complexity also became comparable across age groups. It is interesting that individuals with the least complex structures had the highest levels of well-being. We conclude that affective experiences are not only less variable in the majority of older adults, but also less complex.

Sexual desire after olfactory loss: Quantitative and qualitative reports of patients with smell disorders,"Schafer, L.; Mehler, L.; Hahner, A.; Walliczek, U.; Hummel, T.; Croy, I.","Olfaction moderates human sexual experiences and smell disorder patients sometimes spontaneously complain about impairments in their sexual life.

In addition, subjects completed questionnaires about mood and partnership attachment. Within the patients' group, 29% of the subjects reported decreased sexual desire since the onset of olfactory loss. This change was predicted by depressive symptoms and olfactory function. Qualitative reports revealed for instance that the lack of attraction due to the other's body odor impedes partnership intimacy. The change of sexual desire was significantly related to depression and severity of olfactory impairment but not to partnership attachment. However, in the standardized questionnaire about sexual desire we observed no differences between patients and controls. To sum up, a considerable number of patients state sexual impairment as a concomitant complaint of olfactory dysfunction. Patients do typically not spontaneously report those intimate problems, routine care settings should inform about this common side effect and explicitly ask for sexual life.",2019,Mar 15,Physiol Behav,201,,64-69,30576694.0,10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.12.020,,#1543,Schafer 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

New learning following reactivation in the human brain: targeting emotional memories through rapid serial visual presentation,"Wirkner, J.; Low, A.; Hamm, A. O.; Weymar, M.","Once reactivated, previously consolidated memories destabilize and have to be reconsolidated to persist, a process that might be altered non-invasively by interfering learning immediately after reactivation. Here, we investigated the influence of interference on brain correlates of reactivated episodic memories for emotional and neutral scenes using event-related potentials (ERPs). To selectively target emotional memories we applied a new reactivation method: rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). RSVP leads to enhanced implicit processing (pop out) of the most salient memories making them vulnerable to disruption. In line, interference after reactivation of previously encoded pictures disrupted recollection particularly for emotional events. Furthermore, memory impairments were reflected in a reduced centro-parietal ERP old/new difference during retrieval of emotional pictures. These results provide neural evidence that emotional episodic memories in humans can be selectively altered through behavioral interference after reactivation, a finding with further clinical implications for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",2015,Mar,Neurobiol Learn Mem,119,,63-8,25620694.0,10.1016/j.nlm.2015.01.006,,#1546,Wirkner 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Preventing empathic distress and social stressors at work through nonviolent communication training: A field study with health professionals,"Wacker, R.; Dziobek, I.","One major source of mental health problems in health professionals are personally demanding encounters at work. Thus, a crucial prevention focus is the development of emotional and social skills necessary to effectively manage interactions with clients, colleagues, and supervisors. The aim of our pre-post intervention field study was to evaluate an employee training in nonviolent communication (NVC) within a public health organization. A training group participated in a 3-day NVC training and completed questionnaires before and 3 months after training. Changes in NVC skills, empathic distress, empathy, and social stressors at work were compared with data from a control group without training. Additionally, we observed NVC-trained participants' communication behavior immediately before and after the intervention. We found a promotion of communication skills in training participants as evidenced by increased emotion verbalization behavior and enhanced use of NVC at work. Empathic distress declined, and an increase of social stressors at work was prevented by enhanced emotion verbalization. The findings demonstrate that NVC training can be an effective means to foster emotional and interpersonal skills and to prevent empathic distress and social stressors at work in individuals working in socioemotionally challenging settings. Possible causal mechanisms explaining the training effects are discussed.

Girls' Stuff? Maternal Gender Stereotypes and Their Daughters' Fear,"Gerdes, A. B. M.; Fraunfelter, L. A.; Braband, M.; Alpers, G.

Although there are several theoretical accounts for biological and social contributions to this gender difference, empirical data are surprisingly limited. Interestingly, there is evidence that individuals with stereotypical feminine characteristics are more fearful than those with stereotypical masculine characteristics; this is beyond biological sex. Because gender role stereotypes are reinforced by parental behavior, we aimed to examine the relationship of maternal gender stereotypes and children's fear. Dyads of 38 mothers and their daughters (between ages 6 and 10) were included. We assessed maternal implicit and explicit gender stereotypes as well as their daughters' self-reported general fearfulness, specific fear of snakes, and approach behavior toward a living snake. First, mothers' fear of snakes significantly correlated with their daughters' fear of snakes. Second, mothers' gender stereotypes significantly correlated with their daughters' self-reported fear. Specifically, maternal implicit gender stereotypes were associated with daughters' fear of snakes and fear ratings in response to the snake. Moreover, in children, self-reported fear correlated with avoidance of the fear-relevant animal.

Embracing the positive: an examination of how well resilience factors at age 14 can predict distress at age 17,"Fritz, J.; Stochl, J.; Goodyer, I. M.; van Harmelen, A. L.; Wilkinson, P.

Yet, little is known about how well resilience factors (RFs), i.e. those factors that decrease mental health problems, predict subsequent distress. Therefore, we investigated which RFs are the best indicators for subsequent distress and with what accuracy RFs predict subsequent distress. We examined three interpersonal (e.g. friendships) and seven intrapersonal RFs (e.g. self-esteem) and distress in 1130 adolescents, at age 14 and 17. We estimated the RFs and a continuous distress-index using factor analyses, and ordinal distress-classes using factor mixture models. We then examined how well age-14 RFs and age-14 distress predict age-17 distress, using stepwise linear regressions, relative importance analyses, as well as ordinal and linear prediction models. Low brooding, low negative and high positive self-esteem RFs were the most important indicators for age-17 distress. RFs and age-14 distress predicted age-17 distress similarly. The accuracy was acceptable for ordinal (low/moderate/high age-17 distress-classes: 62-64%), but low for linear models (37-41%). Crucially, the accuracy remained similar when only self-esteem and brooding RFs were used instead of all ten RFs (ordinal = 62%; linear = 37%); correctly predicting for about two-in-three adolescents whether they have low, moderate or high distress 3 years later. RFs, and particularly brooding and self-esteem, seem to predict subsequent distress similarly well as distress can predict itself. As assessing brooding and self-esteem can be strength-focussed and is time-efficient, those RFs may be promising for risk-detection and translational intervention research.",2020,Aug 5,Transl Psychiatry,10,1,272,32759937.0,10.1038/s41398-020-00944-w,,#1550,Fritz 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Evaluation of an Early Intervention Model for Child and Adolescent Victims of Interpersonal Violence,"Calvano, C.; Murray, E.; Bentz, L.; Bos, S.; Reiter, K.; Ihme, L.; Winter, S. M.","Only the minority of youth exposed to traumatic events receive mental health care, as trauma-informed clinical services are lacking or are poorly accessible. In order to bridge this gap, the Outpatient Trauma Clinic (OTC) was founded, an easily accessible early, short-time intervention, with onward referral to follow-up treatment. This report presents the OTC's interventional approach and first outcome data. Using a retrospective naturalistic design, we analyzed trauma- and intervention-related data of the sample (n = 377, 55.4% female, mean age 10.95, SD = 4.69). Following drop-out analyses, predictors for treatment outcome were identified by logistic regression. The majority (81.9%) was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or adjustment disorders. Around one forth dropped out of treatment; these cases showed higher avoidance symptoms at presentation. In 91%, psychological symptoms improved. Experience of multiple traumatic events was the strongest predictor for poor treatment outcome (B = -0.823, SE = 0.313, OR = 0.439, 95% CI 0.238-0.811). Around two thirds were connected to follow-up treatment. The OTC realized a high retention rate, initial improvement of symptoms and referral to subsequent longer-term psychotherapeutic treatment in the majority.

The development of psychological interventions to boost optimism derived from cognitive science would have the potential to provide significant public health benefits, yet cognitive markers of optimism are little understood. The current study aimed to take a first step in this direction by identifying a cognitive marker for optimism that could provide a modifiable target for innovative interventions. In particular we predicted that the ability to generate vivid positive mental imagery of the future would be associated with dispositional optimism. A community sample of 237 participants completed a survey comprising measures of mental imagery and optimism, and socio-demographic information. Vividness of positive future imagery was significantly associated with optimism, even when adjusting for socio-demographic factors and everyday imagery use. The ability to generate vivid mental imagery of positive future events may provide a modifiable cognitive marker of optimism. Boosting positive future imagery could provide a cognitive target for treatment innovations to promote optimism, with implications for mental health and even physical well-being.",2013,Mar 30,Psychiatry Res,206,1,56-61,23084598.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2012.09.047,,#1552,Blackwell 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

H.","Optimization of chances for healthy offspring is thought to be one of the factors driving mate choice and compatibility of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is assumed to determine the offspring's fitness. While humans have been claimed to be able to perceive information of MHC compatibility via the olfactory channel, it remains unknown whether humans use such information for mate choice. By investigation of 3691 married couples, we observed that the high polymorphism of MHC leads to a low chance for homozygous offspring. MHC similarity between couples did not differ from chance, we hence observed no MHC effect in married couples. Hormonal contraception at the time of relationship initiation had no significant effect towards enhanced similarity. A low variety of alleles within a postcode area led to a higher likelihood of homozygous offspring. Based on this data, we conclude that there is no pattern of MHC dis-assortative mating in a genetically diverse Western society.

The modulation of social behavior and empathy via oral contraceptives and female sex hormones,"Strojny, J.; Domes, G.; Fischbacher, U.; von Dawans, B.","Oral contraceptives (OC) and endogenous female sex hormones in naturally cycling women (NC) are related to a wide range of psychological variables (eg, cognition and affect). Little research on social behavior has been done. One study documented a tendency towards more prosocial behavior in NC than OC women, but the underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms remain unknown. The sex hormones progesterone and estradiol are potential candidates. We analyzed social decision-making and social behavior in 83 healthy women (38 OC and 45 NC) via the Social Value Orientation (SVO) and in real social interactions within a paradigm adapted from behavioral economics. We also measured empathy, and collected saliva samples to quantify the basal levels of estradiol and progesterone. Our analyses revealed higher levels of prosocial behavior and emotional empathy in NC than in OC women, a finding supported by higher levels of prosocial decisions in NC than OC women in the SVO. Regarding the underlying biological mechanisms, we detected lower progesterone levels in OC than NC women. Exploratory analyses revealed a negative correlation between progesterone and trust on the trend level. We found no correlations between estradiol and behavior. Our findings provide evidence that OC modulate social behavior and initial indications of a possible modulation by progesterone.

fMRI adaptation reveals: The human mirror neuron system discriminates emotional valence,"Schmidt, S. N. L.; Sojer, C. A.; Hass, J.; Kirsch, P.; Mier, D.","Our ability to infer other individuals' emotions is central for successful social interactions. Based on the theory of embodied simulation, our mirror neuron system (MNS) provides the essential link between the observed facial configuration of another individual and our inference of the emotion by means of common neuronal activation. However, so far it is unknown, whether the MNS differentiates the valence of facial configurations. To increase the precision of our fMRI measurement, we used an adaptation design, which allows insights into whether the same neuronal population is active for subsequent stimuli of facial configurations. 76 participants were shown congruent, or incongruent consecutive pairs of facial configurations expressing fear or happiness. Significant activation for changes in emotional valence from adaptor to target was revealed in fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, amygdala, insula, inferior parietal lobe and Brodmann area 44. In addition, activation change was higher in superior temporal sulcus, insula and inferior frontal gyrus for a switch from happiness to fear than for fear to happiness. Our results suggest an involvement of the MNS in valence discrimination, and a higher sensitivity of the MNS to negative than positive valence. These findings point to a role of the MNS that goes beyond the mere coding of a motor state.",2020,Jul,Cortex,128,,270-280,32438032.0,10.1016/j.cortex.2020.03.026,,#1555,Schmidt 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

We employed a single-case experimental design with multiple baselines. Matching pairs of twelve participants (chronic low back pain >6 months; elevated pain-related fear) were randomly assigned to graded in vivo exposure (EXP) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a yoked design. Primary assessments were taken during baseline (7-26 days), treatment (23-44 days) and at 6-months follow-up (11-30 days) including changes in pain symptoms, disability, pain-related fear, acceptance, body confidence, self-efficacy, and positive thoughts. Psycho-educational, behavioral, cognitive, and exposure interventions were compared to baseline. EXP exhibited immediate middle-to-large effects; CBT's small-to-middle effects were delayed. Within the EXP approach, change mainly occurred during exposure but not during psycho-educational sessions. Overall cortisol was lower in EXP than CBT at post-treatment. We recommend integrating exposure elements in the management of CLBP to increase its efficacy. Psycho-educational sessions might not be necessary or should be adapted, e.g. with stronger focus on motivational aspects. Since CBT seemed to produce delayed effects, core CBT interventions such as cognitive restructuring might be added after exposure treatment to sustain therapeutic effects.",2018,Sep,Behav Res Ther,108,,58-67,30031368.0,10.1016/j.brat.2018.07.002,,#1556,Schemer 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Three scenario-based tests assessed the ability to infer the mental states of story characters in difficult interpersonal situations, the capacity to freely generate good strategies for dealing with such situations and the ability to identify the best solutions among less optimal alternatives. Also, standard tests assessing attention, memory, executive function and trait empathy were administered. Compared to controls, MDD patients showed impaired interpretation of other peoples' sarcastic remarks but not of the mental states underlying other peoples' actions. Furthermore, MDD patients generated fewer strategies that were socially sensitive and practically effective at the same time or at least only socially sensitive. Overall, while the free generation of adequate strategies for difficult social situations was impaired, recognition of optimal solutions among alternatives was spared in MDD patients. Higher generation scores were associated with higher trait empathy and cognitive flexibility scores. We suggest that this specific pattern of impairments ought to be considered in the development of therapies addressing impaired social skills in MDD.",2015,Aug 30,Psychiatry Res,228,3,835-42,26051176.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2015.05.015,,#1557,Thoma 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Facebook non-users have (marginally) significantly higher values of depression symptoms than Facebook users. In both groups, extraversion, self-esteem, happiness, life satisfaction, resilience and social support, on the one hand, and depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, on the other hand, are negatively correlated. Neuroticism is positively associated with depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. However, significant differences exist between Facebook users and Facebook non-users regarding some associations of personality traits and mental health variables.

Overactive performance monitoring in obsessive-compulsive disorder is independent of symptom expression,"Riesel, A.; Kathmann, N.; Endrass, T.","Overactive performance monitoring has been consistently reported in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a clinically heterogeneous disorder and is characterized by several symptom dimensions that may have partially distinct neural correlates. We examined whether performance-monitoring alterations are related to symptom severity and symptom dimensions. Electrocortical correlates of performance monitoring were assessed in 72 OCD patients and 72 matched healthy comparison participants during a flanker task. Amplitudes of the error- and correct-related negativity as well as delta and theta power were used to quantify performance-monitoring activity, and a composite measure was derived using factor analysis. Symptom dimension scores were obtained from the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale symptom checklist. OCD patients showed increased electrocortical responses associated with correct and erroneous responses compared to healthy comparison participants. In patients, no correlations were obtained between performance monitoring and global symptom severity as well as lifetime symptom dimension scores. Only a statistical trend was found that higher symmetry/hoarding scores were associated with reduced performance-monitoring activity. For present symptom dimensions scores, an association with rituals/superstitious symptoms was obtained such that higher scores were associated with greater performance-monitoring activity. However, for both dimensions, subjects with low scores or high scores on each dimension were characterized by overactive performance monitoring compared to healthy controls. Overactive brain processes during performance monitoring are a neural correlate of OCD that is independent of global symptom severity and can be observed for all symptom dimensions. This supports the notion of overactive performance monitoring being a candidate endophenotype for OCD.",2014,Dec,Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,264,8,707-17,24676800.0,10.1007/s00406-014-0499-3,,#1559,Riesel 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Performance monitoring in obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety disorder,"Endrass, T.; Riesel, A.; Kathmann, N.; Buhlmann, U.","Overactive performance monitoring, indexed by greater error-related brain activity, has been frequently observed in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Similar alterations have been found in individuals with major depressive and generalized anxiety disorders. The main objective was to extend these findings by investigating performance monitoring in individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and to evaluate the specificity of performance-monitoring changes in OCD. Event-related potentials were used to examine error-related brain activity during a flanker task in 24 individuals with OCD, 24 individuals with SAD, and 24 healthy controls with no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Error-related negativity (ERN) and correct-related negativity served as electrophysiological indicators for performance monitoring. Enhanced ERN was expected for both clinical groups, but differential associations with clinical symptoms were explored. ERN amplitudes were larger in individuals with OCD and SAD than in healthy controls. Correlational analyses did not reveal significant associations between ERN and clinical symptomatology in OCD, but a significant correlation with depressive symptoms was found in the SAD group. These findings further strengthen the idea that overactive performance monitoring is independent of clinical symptoms in OCD. Furthermore, it may also represent a transdiagnostic vulnerability indicator, although the relationship with clinical symptoms observed in the SAD group needs additional evaluation.",2014,Nov,J Abnorm Psychol,123,4,705-14,25286372.0,10.1037/abn0000012,,#1560,Endrass 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Differences in Food Craving in Individuals With Obesity With and Without Binge Eating Disorder,"Reents, J.; Pedersen, A.","Overeating behavior is supposedly a major contributing factor to weight gain and obesity. Binge eating disorder (BED) with reoccurring episodes of excessive overeating is strongly associated with obesity. Learning models of overeating behavior and BED assume that mere confrontation with food leads to a conditioned response that is experienced as food craving. Accordingly, individuals with obesity and BED were shown to have high trait food cravings. To date, little is known about differences in state food cravings and cue reactivity at the sight of palatable food in individuals with obesity and BED compared to individuals with obesity without BED. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine differences in cue-induced, state and trait food cravings in people with obesity with and without BED. We found that all aspects of food cravings were more prevalent in individuals with obesity and BED than in individuals without BED. By implementing a food cue reactivity paradigm, our results show that individuals with obesity with BED have more cue-induced cravings than individuals with obesity without BED. Moreover, these cue-induced cravings in individuals with obesity and BED were highest for high-fat and high-sugar foods as opposed to low-calorie foods. Thus, our results emphasize the role of increased cue reactivity and craving at the sight of palatable foods in individuals with obesity and BED. Hence, our findings support etiological models of conditioned binge eating and are in line with interventions targeting cue reactivity in BED.",2021,2021/06/02,Front Psychol,12,,660880,34149552.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.660880,,#1561,Reents 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Neurofeedback reduces overeating episodes in female restrained eaters: a randomized controlled pilot-study,"Schmidt, J.; Martin, A.","Overeating episodes, despite of intentions to control weight, are a common problem among women. Recurring episodes of overeating and dietary failure have been reported to result in higher Body Mass Indexes and to induce severe distress even in non-clinical groups. Based on findings from physiological research on eating behavior and craving, as well as previous biofeedback studies, we derived a cue exposure based EEG neurofeedback protocol to target overeating episodes. The treatment was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial, comparing a neurofeedback group (NFG; n = 14) with a waiting list control group (WLG; n = 13) in a sub-clinical sample of female restrained eaters. At post-treatment, the number of weekly overeating episodes and subsequent distress were significantly reduced in the NFG compared to the WLG (p < .01; r > .50). In a 3 month follow-up, effects in the NFG remained stable. As secondary outcomes, perceived dieting success was enhanced after the treatment. At follow-up, additional beneficial effects on trait food craving were observed.

For this purpose, threat estimation, probabilistic classification learning (PCL) and psychopathological measures were assessed in 23 participants with OCD, 30 participants with social phobia, and 31 healthy controls. Whereas healthy participants showed an optimistic expectation bias regarding positive and negative future events, OCD participants lacked such a bias. This lack of an optimistic expectation bias was not specific to OCD. Compared to healthy controls, OCD participants overestimated their personal risk for experiencing negative events, but did not differ from controls in their risk estimation regarding other people. Finally, OCD participants' biases in the prediction of checking-related events were associated with their impairments in learning probabilistic cue-outcome associations in a disorder-relevant context.

It has been shown that endurance athletes possess higher pain tolerance thresholds and a greater effect of conditioned pain modulation than nonathletes, both indicating a more efficient system of endogenous pain inhibition. The aim of the present study was to focus on the neural mechanisms of pain processing in endurance athletes that have not been investigated yet. Therefore, we analyzed the pain processing of 18 male athletes and 19 healthy male nonathletes using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found lower pain ratings in endurance athletes compared to nonathletes to physically identical painful stimulation. Furthermore, brain activations of athletes versus nonathletes during painful heat stimulation revealed reduced activation in several brain regions that are typically activated by nociceptive stimulation. This included the thalamus, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, midcingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and brain stem (BS). Functional connectivity analyses revealed stronger network during painful heat stimulation in athletes between the analyzed brain regions except for connections with the BS that showed reduced functional connectivity in athletes. Post hoc correlation analyses revealed associations of the subject's fitness level and the brain activation strengths, subject's fitness level and functional connectivity, and brain activation strengths and functional connectivity.

The present study aimed at examining whether this dysfunctional defensive reactivity to panic-related body symptoms would no longer be present following successful cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) but would persist when patients show insufficient symptom improvement. Therefore, in the present study, effects of CBT on reported symptoms and defensive response mobilization during interoceptive challenge were investigated using hyperventilation as a respiratory symptom provocation procedure. Changes in defensive mobilization to body symptoms in the course of CBT were investigated in patients with a primary diagnosis of PD with or without agoraphobia by applying a highly standardized hyperventilation task prior to and after a manual-based CBT (n = 38) or a waiting period (wait-list controls: n = 20). Defensive activation was indexed by the potentiation of the amygdala-dependent startle eyeblink response. All patients showed a pronounced defensive response mobilization to body symptoms at baseline. After treatment, no startle reflex potentiation was found in those patients who showed a clinically significant improvement. However, wait-list controls and treatment non-responders continued to show increased defensive responses to actually innocuous body symptoms after the treatment/waiting period.

Universal parent training as a supplement to inpatient psychiatric treatment for children and adolescents,"Schwenck, C.; Schneider, W.; Reichert, A.","Parent trainings constitute an effective method to target aspects of parenting in child and adolescent psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care.

A sample of n = 151 parent-child dyads treated in an inpatient clinic was included in the study and randomly assigned to a treatment group and a waiting-list control group. As dependent measures served child behavior problems, dysfunctional parenting, parental mental health, and parental self-efficacy measured with parent-rated questionnaires prior to the training, post training and 3 months after discharge of the clinic. Additionally, a parent-child-interaction observation was conducted and rated by blind raters. Results indicated a general inpatient treatment effect on all dependent measures assessed with questionnaires. An additional effect of the parent training was only shown for parenting and parental mental health with the treatment group revealing better outcomes post training and at follow-up. No effects were found for the measures assessed by interaction observation. Out of a number of variables, only a low monthly income was associated with a higher reduction of dysfunctional parenting. Results indicate that parent training does not contribute additionally to standard inpatient care with respect to child behavior, but does have an influence on parental well-being, which might have a positive effect on the long run.",2016,Aug,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,25,8,879-89,26707493.0,10.1007/s00787-015-0810-5,,#1568,Schwenck 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
From Early Micro-Temporal Interaction Patterns to Child Cortisol Levels: Toward the Role of Interactive Reparation and Infant Attachment in a Longitudinal Study,"Muller, M.; Zietlow, A. L.; Klauser, N.; Woll, C.; Nonnenmacher, N.; Tronick, E.; Reck, C.","Parental mental disorders increase the risk for insecure attachment in children. However, the quality of caregiver-infant interaction plays a key role in the development of infant attachment. Dyadic interaction is frequently investigated via global scales which are too rough to uncover micro-temporal mechanisms. Prior research found that the latency to reparation of uncoordinated dyadic states is associated with infant behavioral and neuroendocrine regulation. We investigated the hypothesis that this interactive mechanism is critical in predicting secure vs. insecure attachment quality in infancy. We also assessed the predictive quality of infant attachment regarding neuroendocrine reactivity later in childhood. A subsample of N = 58 dyads (n = 22 mothers with anxiety disorders, n = 36 controls) from a larger study were analyzed. At 3-8 months postpartum, maternal anxiety disorders were diagnosed via a structured clinical interview as well as dyadic interaction during the Face-to-Face-Still-Face (FFSF) was observed and coded on a micro-temporal scale. Infant attachment quality was assessed with the strange situation paradigm at 12-24 months of age. In an overlapping subsample of N = 39 (n = 13 mothers with anxiety disorder; n = 26 controls), we assessed child cortisol reactivity at 5 to 6 years of age. Generalized linear modeling revealed that longer latencies to interactive reparation during the reunion episode of the FFSF as well as maternal diagnosis at 3-8 months of age predict insecure attachment in children aged 12-24 months. Cox regressions demonstrated that dyads with infants who developed insecure attachment at 12-24 months of age were 48% less likely to achieve an interactive reparation at 3-8 months of age. Mixed models revealed that compared to securely attached children, children who had developed an insecure attachment at 12-24 months of age had an increased cortisol reactivity at 5 to 6 years of age during free play. The results confirm the hypothesis that the development of attachment is affected by experienced micro-temporal interactive patterns besides diagnostic categories. They also showed that infants of mothers with postpartum anxiety disorders have a more than fivefold increased risk of developing an insecure attachment than the infants of the control group.

Using an ecological systems perspective and a multi-informant approach, we investigated ontogenic (parental childhood experiences of violence), microsystem (parents' and children's psychopathology) and exosystem (families' monthly household income) risk factors for child-directed parental violence in a sample of 226 Burundian families living in refugee camps in Tanzania. Data were collected through individual structured clinical interviews with mothers, fathers, and children. In the child-report path model [chi(2) (6) = 7.752, p = .257, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.036 (p = .562)], children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, externalizing symptoms and paternal PTSD symptoms were positively associated with violence by both parents. Maternal psychosocial impairment was positively associated with child-reported paternal violence. In the parent-report path model [chi(2) (6) = 7.789, p = .254, CFI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.036 (p = .535)], children's externalizing problems as well as a lower monthly household income were positively related to maternal violence. Each parent's childhood victimization was positively linked to their use of violence against children. Maternal psychosocial impairment and paternal alcohol abuse were positively associated with paternal violence. Child and paternal psychopathology, maternal psychosocial impairment, parents' childhood victimization, and families' socioeconomic status may be important targets for prevention and intervention approaches aiming to reduce parental violence against refugee children living in camps.",2022,Aug,J Interpers Violence,37,15-16,NP14507-NP14537,33926287.0,10.1177/08862605211013960,,#1570,Hecker 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Families in the COVID-19 pandemic: parental stress, parent mental health and the occurrence of adverse childhood experiences-results of a representative survey in Germany","Calvano, C.; Engelke, L.; Di Bella, J.; Kindermann, J.; Renneberg, B.; Winter, S. M.","Parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic is highly challenging, with parents having to meet various demands simultaneously. An increase in adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) has been widely predicted, but empirical evidence is still scarce. This study aimed to (1) generate representative data on pandemic-related stress, parental stress, general stress, parental subjective and mental health, and the occurrence of ACEs; (2) identify risk factors for an increase in ACEs, and (3) provide qualitative data on parents' experiences. A representative survey was conducted in Germany in August 2020 with 1024 parents of underage children (M(age) = 41.70, 50.9% female). More than 50% of parents reported being stressed by social distancing and the closure of schools and childcare facilities. Parental stress increased significantly during the pandemic (d = 0.21). Subgroups of parents also reported very high levels of depressive symptoms (12.3%) and anxiety (9.7%). Up to one-third of the sample reported ACEs in the child's lifetime. In this group, 29.1% reported an increase in children witnessing domestic violence during the pandemic, and 42.2% an increase verbal emotional abuse. These families were characterized by higher parental stress, job losses, and younger parent and child age. Positive aspects of the pandemic related primarily to personal or family life (e.g. slower pace of life, increase in family time). While some parents coped well, a particularly negative pattern was observed in a subgroup of families that experienced an increase in ACEs.

Mothers need more information to recognise associated emotions in child facial expressions,"Plank, I. S.; Christiansen, L. N.; Kunas, S. L.; Dziobek, I.; Bermpohl, F.","Parenting requires mothers to read social cues and understand their children. It is particularly important that they recognise their child's emotions to react appropriately, for example, with compassion to sadness or compersion to happiness. Despite this importance, it is unclear how motherhood affects women's ability to recognise emotions associated with facial expressions in children. Using videos of an emotionally neutral face continually and gradually taking on a facial expression associated with an emotion, we quantified the amount of information needed to match the emotion with the facial expression. Mothers needed more information than non-mothers to match the emotions with the facial expressions. Both mothers and non-mothers performed equally on a control task identifying animals instead of emotions, and both groups needed less information when recognising the emotions associated with facial expressions in adolescents than pre-schoolers. These results indicate that mothers need more information for to correctly recognise typically associated emotions in child facial expressions but not for similar tasks not involving emotions. A possible explanation is that child facial expressions associated with emotions may have a greater emotional impact on mothers than non-mothers leading to task interference but possibly also to increased compassion and compersion.",2022,Nov,Cogn Emot,36,7,1299-1312,35930357.0,10.1080/02699931.2022.2105819,,#1572,Plank 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

We aimed to investigate social problem solving strategies in adults with ADHD. Nineteen patients with ADHD and 20 healthy controls were assessed with a scenario-based battery gauging the ability to understand other people's mental states, to recognize interpersonal conflicts and to generate and identify optimal (i.e. both socially sensitive and practically effective) solutions to these conflicts. Furthermore, measures of socioemotional and executive functioning were administered. Patients and controls performed on a similar level with respect to theory of mind, the generation of the ""best"" solution to problematic social situations and the selection of the optimal solution out of alternatives. However, in a fluency task, patients generated fewer optimal solutions, while the number of only socially sensitive, only practically effective or irrelevant solutions was comparable in both groups. The overall ability to freely generate problem solutions was not linked to executive functioning or trait empathy, but better generation abilities were related to lower social interaction anxiety in the patients only. This suggests impaired generation fluency of optimal interpersonal conflict solutions in patients with ADHD which might contribute to higher levels of anxiety in social interactions.",2020,Mar,Psychiatry Res,285,,112721,31818544.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2019.112721,,#1574,Thoma 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Neuronal correlates of social cognition in borderline personality disorder,"Mier, D.; Lis, S.; Esslinger, C.; Sauer, C.; Hagenhoff, M.; Ulferts, J.; Gallhofer, B.; Kirsch, P.","Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) have severe problems in social interactions that might be caused by deficits in social cognition. Since the findings about social-cognitive abilities in BPD are inhomogeneous, ranging from deficits to superior abilities, we aimed to investigate the neuronal basis of social cognition in BPD. We applied a paradigm with three social cognition tasks, differing in their complexity: basal processing of faces with a neutral expression, recognition of emotions, and attribution of emotional intentions (affective ToM). A total of 13 patients with BPD and 13 healthy matched controls (HCs) were included in a functional magnet resonance imaging study. BPD patients showed no deficits in social cognition on the behavioral level. However, while HCs showed increasing activation in areas of the mirror neuron system with increasing complexity in the social-cognitive task, BPD patients had hypoactivation in these areas and hyperactivation in the amygdala which were not modulated by task complexity. This activation pattern seems to reflect an enhanced emotional approach in the processing of social stimuli in BPD that allows good performance in standardized social-cognitive tasks, but might be the basis of social-cognitive deficits in real-life social interactions.",2013,Jun,Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci,8,5,531-7,22362841.0,10.1093/scan/nss028,,#1575,Mier 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Reduced risk avoidance and altered neural correlates of feedback processing in patients with borderline personality disorder,"Endrass, T.; Schuermann, B.; Roepke, S.; Kessler-Scheil, S.; Kathmann, N.","Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) show deficits in reward-guided decision making and learning. The present study examined risk-taking behavior in combination with feedback processing. Eighteen BPD patients and 18 healthy controls performed a probabilistic two-choice gambling task, while an electroencephalogram was recorded. Options differed in risk, but were identical in expected value and outcome probability. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the feedback-related P300 were analyzed. Healthy controls preferred low-risk over high-risk options, whereas BPD patients chose both option with equal probability. FRN amplitudes were reduced in BPD, but effects of feedback valence and risk did not differ between groups. This suggests attenuated outcome processing in the anterior cingulate cortex, but intact reward prediction error signaling. Furthermore, the modulation of the feedback-related P300 with feedback valence and risk was smaller in BPD patients, and decreased P300 amplitudes were associated with increased behavioral risk-taking behavior. These findings could relate to the reduced ability of BPD patients to learn and adequately adjust their behavior based on feedback information, possibly due to reduced significance of negative feedback.",2016,Sep 30,Psychiatry Res,243,,14-22,27344588.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2016.06.016,,#1576,Endrass 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Impaired differential learning of fear versus safety signs in obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Elsner, B.; Reuter, B.; Said, M.; Linnman, C.; Kathmann, N.; Beucke, J. C.","Pavlovian learning mechanisms are of great importance both for models of psychiatric disorders and treatment approaches, but understudied in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Using an established Pavlovian fear conditioning and reversal procedure, we studied skin conductance responses in 41 patients with OCD and in 32 matched healthy control participants. Within both groups, fear acquisition and reversal effects were evident. When comparing groups, patients showed impaired differential learning of threatening and safe stimuli, consistent with previous research. In contrast to prior findings, differential learning impairments were restricted to fear acquisition, and not observed in the reversal stage of the experiment. As previous and present fear reversal experiments in OCD differed in the use of color coding to facilitate stimulus discrimination, the studies converge to suggest that differential learning of threatening versus safe stimuli is impaired in OCD, but manifests itself differently depending on the difficulty of the association to be learned. When supported by the addition of color, patients with OCD previously appeared to acquire an association early but failed to reverse it according to changed contingencies. In absence of such color coding of stimuli, our data suggest that patients with OCD already show differential learning impairments during fear acquisition, which may relate to findings of altered coping with uncertainty previously observed in OCD. Impaired differential learning of threatening versus safe stimuli should be studied further in OCD, in order to determine whether impairments in differential learning predict treatment outcomes in patients, and whether they are etiologically relevant for OCD.",2022,Feb,Psychophysiology,59,2,e13956,34658040.0,10.1111/psyp.13956,,#1577,Elsner 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Are media reports able to cause somatic symptoms attributed to WiFi radiation? An experimental test of the negative expectation hypothesis,"Brascher, A. K.; Raymaekers, K.; Van den Bergh, O.; Witthoft, M.","People suffering from idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) experience numerous non-specific symptoms that they attribute to EMF. The cause of this condition remains vague and evidence shows that psychological rather than bioelectromagnetic mechanisms are at work. We hypothesized a role of media reports in the etiology of IEI-EMF and investigated how somatosensory perception is affected. 65 healthy participants were instructed that EMF exposure can lead to enhanced somatosensory perception. Participants were randomly assigned to watch either a television report on adverse health effects of EMF or a neutral report. During the following experiment, participants rated stimulus intensities of tactile (electric) stimuli while being exposed to a sham WiFi signal in 50% of the trials. Sham WiFi exposure led to increased intensity ratings of tactile stimuli in the WiFi film group, especially in participants with higher levels of somatosensory amplification. Participants of the WiFi group reported more anxiety concerning WiFi exposure than the Control group and tended to perceive themselves as being more sensitive to EMF after the experiment compared to before. Sensational media reports can facilitate enhanced perception of tactile stimuli in healthy participants. People tending to perceive bodily symptoms as intense, disturbing, and noxious seem most vulnerable. Receiving sensational media reports might sensitize people to develop a nocebo effect and thereby contribute to the development of IEI-EMF. By promoting catastrophizing thoughts and increasing symptom-focused attention, perception might more readily be enhanced and misattributed to EMF.",2017,Jul,Environ Res,156,,265-271,28371755.0,10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.040,,#1579,Brascher 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Asking for work adjustments or initiating behavioural changes - what makes a 'problematic co-worker' score Brownie points? An experimental study on the reactions towards colleagues with a personality disorder,"Muschalla, B.; Fay, D.; Seemann, A.","People with mental disorders, especially personality disorders, often face low acceptance at work. This is particularly problematic when returning to work after sick leave, because it impedes reintegration into the former workplace. This study explores colleagues' reactions towards a problematic worker dependent on the returning person's reintegration strategy: The returning person undertaking changes in their behaviour is compared with the person requesting adjustments of the workplace. In an experimental study, 188 employed persons read one of four vignettes that described a return-to-work-situation of a problematic co-worker. Across all vignettes, the co-worker was depicted as having previously caused problems in the work team. In the first vignette, the co-worker did not change anything (control condition) when she returned to work; in the second, she asked for workplace adjustments; in the third vignette she initiated efforts to change her own behaviour; and the fourth vignette combined both workplace adjustments and behavioural change. Study participants were asked for their reactions towards the problematic co-worker. Vignettes that included a behavioural change evoked more positive reactions towards the co-worker than vignettes without any behavioural change. Asking for workplace adjustments alone did not yield more positive reactions compared to not initiating any change. When preparing employees with interactional problems for their return to work, it is not effective to only instruct them on their statutory entitlement for workplace adjustments. Instead, it is advisable to encourage them to proactively strive for behaviour changes.",2016,Oct,Psychol Health Med,21,7,856-62,26567587.0,10.1080/13548506.2015.1109671,,#1580,Muschalla 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

We conducted an online-study in an ad-hoc community sample (N = 261). Participants self-reported on psychotic symptoms (negative symptoms, depression, positive symptoms, anhedonia) and rated positivity, negativity, and arousal elicited by pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral stimuli. The data were analyzed with multilevel linear models. Increasing levels of all assessed symptom areas showed significant associations with diminished positivity offset. Increased ambivalence was related only to positive symptoms. Our results show that the diminished positivity offset is associated with psychotic symptoms in a community sample, including, but not limited to, negative symptoms.

Investigating the social costs of schizophrenia: Facial expressions in dyadic interactions of people with and without schizophrenia,"Riehle, M.; Lincoln, T. M.","People with schizophrenia show marked reductions in their emotional expressiveness, generally known as blunted affect. In this study, we tested whether interaction partners would evaluate community-dwelling participants with schizophrenia less favorably than healthy controls and whether this difference would be explained by reduced smiling behavior related to schizophrenia. We also tested whether deficient affect recognition would predict reduced smiling. We created 3 study groups, consisting of 28 participants each, participants with schizophrenia (SZ), healthy controls (HC), and naive healthy interaction partners (IP). IP engaged in 2 separate same-sex dyadic interactions with matched members of each of the other 2 groups, SZ and HC, in a repeated-measures study design. During the interactions, we assessed the amount of smiling and mimicry of smiling via electromyography. After the interactions, IP rated their willingness for future interactions with SZ and HC, respectively. IP indicated less willingness for future interactions with SZ than with HC participants (d = -0.72) but SZ and HC did not differ with respect to smiling or affect recognition. Better affect recognition predicted more smiling; more smiling predicted more favorable social evaluations. Within SZ participants, disorganization symptoms but no other symptom dimensions were associated with the social evaluations. In conclusion, community-dwelling people with schizophrenia face social challenges that go beyond the adverse effects of stigmatization. Future work needs to clarify the role of different symptom dimensions and behavioral aspects contributing to the interpersonal costs of schizophrenia to derive interventions targeted at social reintegration.

Perceived burdensomeness was considered as predictor of suicide ideation concurrently, after the fourth and the tenth therapy session and posttreatment - controlling for baseline symptom distress, suicide ideation, number of therapy sessions and age. Furthermore, pre-to post-changes in suicide ideation and perceived burdensomeness were assessed. Perceived burdensomeness emerged as a significant predictor of suicidal ideation concurrently and after the fourth and the tenth therapy session, but not at the end of therapy.

Why are you looking like that? How the context influences evaluation and processing of human faces,"Schwarz, K. A.; Wieser, M. J.; Gerdes, A. B.; Muhlberger, A.; Pauli, P.","Perception and evaluation of facial expressions are known to be heavily modulated by emotional features of contextual information. Such contextual effects, however, might also be driven by non-emotional aspects of contextual information, an interaction of emotional and non-emotional factors, and by the observers' inherent traits. Therefore, we sought to assess whether contextual information about self-reference in addition to information about valence influences the evaluation and neural processing of neutral faces. Furthermore, we investigated whether social anxiety moderates these effects. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants viewed neutral facial expressions preceded by a contextual sentence conveying either positive or negative evaluations about the participant or about somebody else. Contextual influences were reflected in rating and fMRI measures, with strong effects of self-reference on brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and right fusiform gyrus. Additionally, social anxiety strongly affected the response to faces conveying negative, self-related evaluations as revealed by the participants' rating patterns and brain activity in cortical midline structures and regions of interest in the left and right middle frontal gyrus.

Reinforcement of perceptual inference: reward and punishment alter conscious visual perception during binocular rivalry,"Wilbertz, G.; van Slooten, J.; Sterzer, P.","Perception is an inferential process, which becomes immediately evident when sensory information is conflicting or ambiguous and thus allows for more than one perceptual interpretation. Thinking the idea of perception as inference through to the end results in a blurring of boundaries between perception and action selection, as perceptual inference implies the construction of a percept as an active process. Here we therefore wondered whether perception shares a key characteristic of action selection, namely that it is shaped by reinforcement learning. In two behavioral experiments, we used binocular rivalry to examine whether perceptual inference can be influenced by the association of perceptual outcomes with reward or punishment, respectively, in analogy to instrumental conditioning. Binocular rivalry was evoked by two orthogonal grating stimuli presented to the two eyes, resulting in perceptual alternations between the two gratings. Perception was tracked indirectly and objectively through a target detection task, which allowed us to preclude potential reporting biases. Monetary reward or punishments were given repeatedly during perception of only one of the two rivaling stimuli. We found an increase in dominance durations for the percept associated with reward, relative to the non-rewarded percept. In contrast, punishment led to an increase of the non-punished compared to a relative decrease of the punished percept. Our results show that perception shares key characteristics with action selection, in that it is influenced by reward and punishment in opposite directions, thus narrowing the gap between the conceptually separated domains of perception and action selection. We conclude that perceptual inference is an adaptive process that is shaped by its consequences.",2014,2014/12/03,Front Psychol,5,,1377,25520687.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01377,,#1586,Wilbertz 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Cross-decoding supramodal information in the human brain,"Levine, S. M.; Schwarzbach, J. V.","Perceptual decision making is the cognitive process wherein the brain classifies stimuli into abstract categories for more efficient downstream processing. A system that, during categorization, can process information regardless of the information's original sensory modality (i.e., a supramodal system) would have a substantial advantage over a system with dedicated processes for specific sensory modalities. While many studies have probed decision processes through the lens of one sensory modality, it remains unclear whether there are such supramodal brain areas that can flexibly process task-relevant information regardless of the original ""format"" of the information. To investigate supramodality, one must ensure that supramodal information exists somewhere within the functional architecture by rendering information from multiple sensory systems necessary but insufficient for categorization. To this aim, we tasked participants with categorizing auditory and tactile frequency-modulated sweeps according to learned, supramodal categories in a delayed match-to-category paradigm while we measured their blood-oxygen-level dependent signal with functional MRI. To detect supramodal information, we implemented a set of cross-modality pattern classification analyses, which demonstrated that the left caudate nucleus encodes category-level information but not stimulus-specific information (such as spatial directions and stimulus modalities), while the right inferior frontal gyrus, showing the opposite pattern, encodes stimulus-specific information but not category-level information. Given our paradigm, these results reveal abstract representations in the brain that are independent of motor, semantic, and sensory-specific processing, instead reflecting supramodal, categorical information, which points to the caudate nucleus as a locus of cognitive processes involved in complex behavior.",2018,Dec,Brain Struct Funct,223,9,4087-4098,30143866.0,10.1007/s00429-018-1740-z,,#1587,Levine 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Decoding of auditory and tactile perceptual decisions in parietal cortex,"Levine, S.

Parietal cortex is involved in many tasks that require perceptual decisions such as attentional focusing, categorization, and eventually response selection. While much work in both the human and monkey domains has investigated processes related to visual decision making, relatively little research has explored auditory and tactile perceptual decisions. As such, we wanted to know whether these regions also play a role in auditory and tactile decision making. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging on humans and a paradigm specifically designed to avoid motor confounds, we found that one area in the right intraparietal sulcus, contained high-level abstract representations of auditory and tactile category-specific information.

In parallel, we investigated whether the different types of presentation resulted in differences in olfactory event-related potentials (OERP). Psychophysical ratings showed that the dichorhinic mixtures were perceived as more intense than the physical mixtures. A tendency for shift in perceived quality was also observed. In line with these perceptual changes, the OERP showed a shift in latencies and amplitudes for early (more ""sensory"") peaks P1 and N1 whereas no significant differences were observed for the later (more ""cognitive"") peak P2.

We included 149 university students (83.2% female, 24.60 yrs) with varying degrees of somatic symptom distress who were either allocated to the 8-week intervention with regular, written therapeutic guidance (iSOMA guided) or to the control group (waitlist), which was afterwards crossed over to receive iSOMA with guidance-on-demand (iSOMA-GoD). Primary outcomes were somatic symptom distress (assessed by the PHQ-15) and psychobehavioral symptoms of the somatic symptom disorder (assessed by the SSD-12) at pre- and post-treatment. Secondary outcomes included depression, anxiety, and disability. Both treatments showed statistically significant pre-post improvements in primary (iSOMA-guided: d = 0.86-0.92, iSOMA-GoD: d = 0.55-0.63) and secondary outcomes. However, intention-to-treat analysis revealed non-significant between-group effects for all outcomes (ps >/= .335), after controlling for confounding variables, and effect sizes were marginal (d = -0.06 to 0.12). Overall, our findings indicate that Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy with regular guidance is not unequivocally superior to guidance-on-demand in alleviating somatic symptom distress and associated psychopathology in emerging adults.

"Interpersonal Distance During Real-Time Social Interaction: Insights From Subjective Experience, Behavior, and Physiology","Kroczek, L. O. H.; Pfaller, M.; Lange, B.; Muller, M.; Muhlberger, A.","Physical distance is a prominent feature in face-to-face social interactions and allows regulating social encounters. Close interpersonal distance (IPD) increases emotional responses during interaction and has been related to avoidance behavior in social anxiety. However, a systematic investigation of the effects of IPD on subjective experience combined with measures of physiological arousal and behavioral responses during real-time social interaction has been missing. Virtual Reality allows for a controlled manipulation of IPD while maintaining naturalistic social encounters. The present study investigates IPD in social interaction using a novel paradigm in Virtual Reality. Thirty-six participants approached virtual agents and engaged in short interactions. IPD was varied between 3.5 and 1 m by manipulating the distance at which agents reacted to the participant's approach. Closer distances were rated as more arousing, less pleasant, and less natural than longer distances and this effect was significantly modulated by social anxiety scores. Skin conductance responses were also increased at short distances compared to longer distances. Finally, an interaction of IPD and social anxiety was observed for avoidance behavior, measured as participants' backward motion during interaction, with stronger avoidance related to close distances and high values of social anxiety. These results highlight the influence of IPD on experience, physiological response, and behavior during social interaction. The interaction of social anxiety and IPD suggests including the manipulation of IPD in behavioral tests in Virtual Reality as a promising tool for the treatment of social anxiety disorder.",2020,2020/06/12,Front Psychiatry,11,,561,32595544.0,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00561,,#1592,Kroczek 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Neutral is negative enough-Peer victimization influences cardiac, facial-muscular and experiential reactions to both negative evaluative and neutral social stimuli","Iffland, B.; Wiggert, N.; Neuner, F.; Blechert, J.","Physiological stress responses vary as a function of adverse childhood experiences. However, previous studies concentrate on familial sources of childhood adversity. Potential long-term effects of peer victimization on physiology and affective responses are less known. This study examined cardiac, facial-muscular, and experiential responses to social evaluative stimuli in ninety-four healthy subjects with various degrees of experienced peer victimization. In a social conditioning task, peer victimization was associated with similarly attenuated cardiac and facial-muscular responses to negative and neutral stimuli, while differentiated physiological responses to negative and neutral stimuli were found in subjects without peer victimization. Overall, increased ratings of arousal, valence and disapproval for negative compared to neutral stimuli were found. Contrary to the physiological response, peer victimization was associated with more negative ratings of negative stimuli one month after acquisition. The results suggest that the physiological and experiential reactivity towards both negative and neutral social stimuli is affected by the experience of peer victimization. Peer victimization causes generalized autonomic dysregulation and memory recall biases during social learning impeding adequate response preparation to social stressors.",2018,Nov,Biol Psychol,139,,152-162,30296467.0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2018.10.005,,#1593,Iffland 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Resulting from Torture and Other Traumatic Events among Syrian Kurdish Refugees in Kurdistan Region, Iraq","Ibrahim, H.; Hassan, C. Q.","Political violence is known to cause psychological distress. There is a large body of empirical studies drawing correlations between war trauma, torture, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, there are few studies on the effects of war-related trauma among Syrian refugees after events following the 'Arab Spring' uprisings between 2010 and 2012. This study examines the association of PTSD symptoms with torture and other traumatic events among Syrian Kurdish refugees living in Kurdistan Region, Iraq. The experiences and PTSD symptoms among 91 Syrian Kurdish refugees in the Arbat camp in the Sulaymaniyah Governorate of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq were assessed using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, sections I, IV, and V. Results showed that the estimated levels of PTSD symptoms were high: between 35 and 38%. There were no significant gender differences in the occurrence of PTSD symptoms. However, men reported more general traumatic experiences than women. There were significant positive correlations between PTSD symptoms with traumatic events and torture (r = 0.500, r = 0.366, respectively). Examining the mental health impact of torture and other traumatic events among refugees has possible implications for organizations managing rehabilitation programs for individuals who have been exposed to traumatic events.",2017,2017/02/20,Front Psychol,8,,241,28265252.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00241,,#1594,Ibrahim 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Neurocognitive deficits or stress overload: Why do individuals with schizophrenia show poor performance in neurocognitive tests?,"Krkovic, K.; Moritz, S.; Lincoln, T. M.","Poor performance in neurocognitive tasks is consistently found across studies in all stages of schizophrenia spectrum disorders and is interpreted as an underlying, brain function-related, neurocognitive deficit. However, neurocognitive test performance in schizophrenia might be compromised by patients' increased stress level. We investigated group-differences in neurocognitive performance while accounting for psychophysiological (salivary cortisol, heart rate, skin conductance level) and self-reported stress. We included 35 patients with schizophrenia, 29 participants with attenuated psychotic symptoms, 26 first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia and 28 healthy controls. Participants completed a neurocognitive test battery that assessed processing speed, task switching, attention, working memory, verbal episodic memory, and verbal comprehension. Multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) were calculated to test for main effects of group on neurocognitive performance thereby not accounting versus accounting for confounding effects of stress. As expected, patients with schizophrenia scored lower than the other groups in all neurocognitive domains. Participants with attenuated psychotic symptoms, first-degree relatives and healthy individuals did not differ from each other in their performance. After accounting for heart rate and self-reported stress, the multivariate effect of group on neurocognition remained significant, but was rendered non-significant for specific domains - working memory capacity, episodic memory, and long-term memory. The findings imply that stress is relevant to neurocognitive performance and this should be taken into account when interpreting the origin of performance deficits in schizophrenia patients.",2017,May,Schizophr Res,183,,151-156,27838097.0,10.1016/j.schres.2016.11.002,,#1596,Krkovic 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Daily fluctuations in positive affect positively co-vary with working memory performance,"Brose, A.; Lovden, M.; Schmiedek, F.","Positive affect is related to cognitive performance in multiple ways. It is associated with motivational aspects of performance, affective states capture attention, and information processing modes are a function of affect. In this study, we examined whether these links are relevant within individuals across time when they experience minor ups and downs of positive affect and work on cognitive tasks in the laboratory on a day-to-day basis. Using a microlongitudinal design, 101 younger adults (20-31 years of age) worked on 3 working memory tasks on about 100 occasions. Every day, they also reported on their momentary affect and their motivation to work on the tasks. In 2 of the 3 tasks, performance was enhanced on days when positive affect was above average. This performance enhancement was also associated with more motivation. Importantly, increases in task performance on days with above-average positive affect were mainly unrelated to variations in negative affect.

Participants then recorded any involuntary memories of the imagined training scenarios in a three-day diary before returning to the lab for a follow-up assessment. Participants were randomised to imagine the scenarios in either an emotionally involved or emotionally detached manner, providing a test of the role of emotion in the subsequent experience of involuntary memories. Participants reported experiencing involuntary memories of the training scenarios in their daily life, but the number recorded did not differ between the experimental conditions.

"Positive Mental Health Scale: Validation and measurement invariance across eight countries, genders, and age groups","Velten, J.; Brailovskaia, J.; Margraf, J.","Positive mental health (PMH), defined as the presence of general emotional, psychological, and social well-being is an important factor of general mental health. To allow for valid comparisons of PMH across different groups of interest, measurement invariant instruments are needed. The present study tested the measurement invariance of the nine-item Positive Mental Health Scale (PMH-Scale) across eight countries (i.e., France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) as well as across genders, and age groups. Population-based online-panel surveys were conducted (N per country > 1,000). The PMH-Scale showed good to excellent internal consistency as well as unidimensionality in all subsamples. Convergent validity was supported by positive correlations with the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (F-SozU K-6), discriminant validity was shown be negative correlations with the subscales of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21). The PMH-Scale showed scalar measurement invariance across countries, genders, and age groups. Comparisons of latent means showed small to medium group differences, with highest levels of PMH found in the French and US-American samples as well in participants between 45 and 54 years of age. Lowest levels of PMH were found in Russian participants. Gender differences in PMH were negligible. The PMH-Scale can be used to meaningfully compare the levels of PMH across the eight investigated countries, women, and men, as well as younger and older individuals.

General self-efficacy as a driving factor of post-stroke depression: A longitudinal study,"Volz, M.; Voelkle, M. C.; Werheid, K.","Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common psychiatric condition after stroke, affecting one third of survivors. Despite identification of meaningful predictors, knowledge about the interplay between these factors remains fragmentary. General self-efficacy (GSE) is closely linked to PSD, yet direction and magnitude of this relationship remains unclear. The authors assessed the relationship between GSE and depression during the first two years post-stroke while controlling for stable inter-individual differences using continuous time (CT) structural equation modelling (SEM). Patients of two German rehabilitation centres (N = 294, mean age = 63.78 years, SD = 10.83) were assessed six weeks after ischemic stroke and at four follow-ups covering two years. GSE Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were used to assess GSE and depression. CT-analysis revealed significantly higher within-person cross-effects of GSE on GDS (a(21) = -.29) than vice versa (a(12 )= -.17). Maximal cross-lagged effects emerged six months post-stroke. Our results show that decreasing GSE led to increasing depressiveness, and only to a smaller extent vice versa. This suggests that fostering GSE by strengthening perceived control after stroke can counter PSD emersion and exacerbation. Six months post-stroke, when patients face social re-integration, programmes focusing on GSE could potentially help to prevent later PSD.",2019,Oct,Neuropsychol Rehabil,29,9,1426-1438,29299953.0,10.1080/09602011.2017.1418392,,#1603,Volz 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

In the general population, depression is consistently reported to be more frequent in women than in men. Evidence about gender differences in PSD remains inconclusive and it is unknown if established risk factors exert gender-specific influence. The authors examined gender differences in PSD prevalence, persistence and influence of established risk factors using chi (2)- and Welch's t-tests and continuous-time structural equation modelling (CT-SEM). Patients (N = 301) from the longitudinal Berlin-PSD-study were assessed six weeks (baseline), and up to four times during the first 2.5 years post-stroke using DSM-5 depression criteria and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Established risk factors were assessed at baseline. Women showed higher PSD prevalence and severity at baseline (p < .01) but not thereafter (p >/= .43). CT-SEM analysis revealed that known risk factors predicted depression, yet predictive value and persistence did not differ between genders. Our results showed that established PSD risk factors influence both genders to a similar extent and that in contrast to depression in the general population, gender differences in PSD prevalence and severity disappeared within six months post-stroke.

Cardiac reactions to emotional words in adolescents and young adults with PTSD after child abuse,"Iffland, B.; Klein, F.; Rosner, R.; Renneberg, B.; Steil, R.; Neuner, F.","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with alterations in cardiac reactivity to threat cues. Meta-analyses have summarized that adults with PTSD have increased heart rates in response to trauma-related stimuli.

In children and adolescents with PTSD, reports of cardiac alterations are rare and ambiguous. So far, most studies in adolescents and young adults are restricted to victims of accidents, even though PTSD is highly prevalent in victims of child maltreatment. The present study aimed at investigating cardiac reactions in adolescents and young adults with PTSD after child abuse. Cardiac responses to standardized emotional words were studied in 39 adolescent and young adult PTSD patients after childhood sexual and/or physical abuse as compared to 39 healthy control subjects (age range: 15-20 years). The experimental paradigm consisted of a passive reading task with neutral, positive, physically threatening, and socially threatening (swear) words. Results showed that cardiac reactions to negative stimuli, particularly physically threatening stimuli, were less pronounced in PTSD patients than in controls. Moreover, cardiac reactions in response to socially threatening words were less variable in the PTSD group. No differences between and within groups were present in reaction to neutral or positive stimuli. Findings suggest that a physiologically blunted subtype of PTSD may already manifest during adolescence and young adulthood.

In a cross-validation experiment, their performance was further evaluated in the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT). PTSD patients demonstrated impairments in episodic memory formation and mental time travel and showed difficulties in utilizing information from episodic memory to solve problems. Diminished attention and concentration in PTSD did not account for performance deficits in these tasks but higher levels of negative arousal were found in PTSD patients. Furthermore, performance in the VR-EMT and RBMT in PTSD patients correlated negatively with self-reported measures of stress and depression.

Expression of DNA repair genes and its relevance for DNA repair in peripheral immune cells of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Behnke, A.; Mack, M.; Fieres, J.; Christmann, M.; Burkle, A.; Moreno-Villanueva, M.; Kolassa, I. T.","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involves elevated levels of cellular oxidative stress which jeopardizes the integrity of essential cell compartments. Previously, we demonstrated higher levels of DNA lesions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in PTSD.

Accordingly, we hypothesized to find increased expression rates of the DNA-repair genes X-ray repair cross complementing 1 (XRCC1), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), and polymerase beta (Polbeta) in PBMCs of PTSD patients as compared to controls, leading to functionally relevant changes in DNA-repair kinetics. In a cohort of 14 refugees with PTSD and 15 without PTSD, we found significantly higher XRCC1 expression in PTSD patients than controls (U = 161.0, p = 0.009, Cohen's r = 0.49), and positive correlations between the severity of PTSD symptoms and the expression of XRCC1 (r(S) = 0.57, p = 0.002) and PARP1 (r(S) = 0.43, p = 0.022).

After that, participants received either positive or negative CBM-App training. Within each training, half of the participants then had a 90-minute nap or watched a neutral movie. Results showed that the CBM training induced training-congruent appraisals. Sleep did not enhance this effect. Participants who slept, however, experienced fewer intrusive memories of the analogue trauma, but this effect was independent of the CBM condition.

Baseline measurement for 5 consecutive nights was followed by a 5-night experimental intervention or placebo trial. During the intervention, patients received nocturnal stimulation with a pleasant odor (odor condition) or clean air (placebo condition) via an olfactometer that delivered inspiration-triggered stimuli in a nasal tube or via an odorized nasal clip. After each night, the patients completed standardized questionnaires that assessed sleep parameters and dream content. Each night, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and wakefulness after sleep onset were monitored with a motion biosensor. Baseline assessment revealed that PTSD severity was associated with poorer sleep outcomes. An interaction effect showed that nocturnal odorization affected dream intensity. Post hoc tests revealed an improvement in the group that used the nasal clip as compared to baseline, d = 0.68. No negative effects were observed after odorization with the nasal clip.

However, studies with non-clinical human samples in de novo fear conditioning paradigms have demonstrated minimal to no benefit of DCS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of DCS on the retention of extinction learning following de novo fear conditioning in a clinical sample. Eighty-one patients with social anxiety disorder were recruited and underwent a previously validated de novo fear conditioning and extinction paradigm over the course of three days. Of those, only 43 (53%) provided analyzable data. During conditioning on Day 1, participants viewed images of differently colored lamps, two of which were followed by with electric shock (CS+) and a third which was not (CS-). On Day 2, participants were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg DCS or placebo, administered in a double-blind manner 1 hour prior to extinction training with a single CS+ in a distinct context. Day 3 consisted of tests of extinction recall and renewal. The primary outcome was skin conductance response to conditioned stimuli, and shock expectancy ratings were examined as a secondary outcome. Results showed greater skin conductance and expectancy ratings in response to the CS+ compared to CS- at the end of conditioning. As expected, this difference was no longer present at the end of extinction training, but returned at early recall and renewal phases on Day 3, showing evidence of return of fear. In contrast to hypotheses, DCS had no moderating influence on skin conductance response or expectancy of shock during recall or renewal phases.

"The endocannabinoid system in humans: significant associations between anandamide, brain function during reward feedback and a personality measure of reward dependence","Redlich, C.; Dlugos, A.; Hill, M. N.; Patel, S.; Korn, D.; Enneking, V.; Foerster, K.; Arolt, V.; Domschke, K.; Dannlowski, U.; Redlich, R.","Preclinical evidence indicates that the endocannabinoid system is involved in neural responses to reward. This study aimed to investigate associations between basal serum concentrations of the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) with brain functional reward processing. Additionally, a personality measure of reward dependence was obtained. Brain functional data were obtained of 30 right-handed adults by conducting fMRI at 3 Tesla using a reward paradigm. Reward dependence was obtained using the subscale reward dependence of the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). Basal concentrations of AEA and 2-AG were determined in serum. Analyzing the fMRI data, for AEA and 2-AG ANCOVAs were calculated using a full factorial model, with condition (reward > control, loss > control) and concentrations for AEA and 2-AG as factors. Regression analyses were conducted for AEA and 2-AG on TPQ-RD scores. A whole-brain analysis showed a significant interaction effect of AEA concentration by condition (positive vs. negative) within the putamen (x = 26, y = 16, z = -8, F13.51, TFCE((1, 54)) = 771.68, k = 70, P(FWE) = 0.044) resulting from a positive association of basal AEA concentrations and putamen activity to rewarding stimuli, while this association was absent in the loss condition. AEA concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with TPQ reward dependence scores (r(spearman) = -0.56, P = 0.001). These results show that circulating AEA may modulate brain activation during reward feedback and that the personality measure reward dependence is correlated with AEA concentrations in healthy human volunteers. Future research is needed to further characterize the nature of the lipids' influence on reward processing, the impact on reward anticipation and outcome, and on vulnerability for psychiatric disorders.",2021,Apr,Neuropsychopharmacology,46,5,1020-1027,33007775.0,10.1038/s41386-020-00870-x,,#1614,Redlich 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Feasibility of Present-Centered Therapy for Prolonged Grief Disorder: Results of a Pilot Study,"Vogel, A.; Comtesse, H.; Nocon, A.; Kersting, A.; Rief, W.; Steil, R.; Rosner, R.","Present-centered therapy (PCT) was originally developed as a strong comparator for the non-specific effects of psychotherapy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. PCT qualifies as a not strictly supportive treatment as it is structured and homework is assigned between sessions. It does not focus on cognitive restructuring or exposure. A growing body of literature supports its beneficial effects. For example, it demonstrated only slightly inferior effect sizes and lower dropout rates compared to that of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy in several trials with patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. The current study is the first to evaluate the feasibility and the treatment effects of PCT in adults with prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Meta-analyses on psychotherapy for PGD have yielded moderate effect sizes. N = 20 individuals suffering from PGD were treated with PCT by novice therapists as part of a preparation phase for an upcoming RCT in an outpatient setting. Treatment consisted of 20-24 sessions a 50 min. All outcomes were assessed before treatment, at post-treatment, and at the 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome, PGD symptom severity, was assessed using the Interview for Prolonged Grief-13. Secondary outcomes were self-reported PGD severity, depression, general psychological distress, and somatic symptom severity. Furthermore, therapists evaluated their experiences with their first PCT patient and the treatment manual. In intent-to-treat analyses of all patients we found a significant decrease in interview-based PGD symptom severity at post-treatment (d = 1.26). Decreases were maintained up to the 3-month follow-up assessment (d = 1.25). There were also significant decreases in self-reported PGD symptoms, depression, and general psychological distress. No changes were observed for somatic symptoms. The completion rate was 85%. Therapists deemed PCT to be a learnable treatment program that can be adapted to the patient's individual needs. The preliminary results of PCT as a treatment for PGD demonstrate large effects and indicate good feasibility in outpatient settings. The treatment effects were larger than those reported in meta-analyses. Thus, PCT is a promising treatment for PGD.

Gentle as a mother's touch: C-tactile touch promotes autonomic regulation in preterm infants,"Puschel, I.; Reichert, J.; Friedrich, Y.; Bergander, J.; Weidner, K.; Croy, I.","Preterm infants are challenged to adapt to an extrauterine milieu, while their interoceptive system and autonomic regulation capacity is still immature. Caressing parental touch is known to foster parasympathetic regulation in infants by stimulating C-tactile (CT) afferents and in preterm infants, slow stroking stimulation also leads to a heart rate decrease. The particular impact of maternal stroking has not yet been investigated and factors influencing the maturation of the CT system in preterm infants remain unclear. We therefore analysed 53 standardized events in which preterm infants (24 to 36 weeks gestational age at birth) were stroked by their mothers. Video analysis revealed that mothers use CT optimal velocities to stroke their preterm child. Analysis of pulse oximetric data showed no effect of stroking on infantile blood oxygenation, but a significant decrease of the heart rate. Compared to term-born children, this decrease was delayed by about two minutes. Furthermore, our data suggested that more immature preterm infants benefited less from stroking than more mature ones. We conclude that maternal stroking touch targets CT afferents in preterm infants and that the preterm CT system is not yet mature.",2022,Dec 1,Physiol Behav,257,,113991,36242858.0,10.1016/j.physbeh.2022.113991,,#1617,Puschel 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Education and mental health: Do psychosocial resources matter?,"Niemeyer, H.; Bieda, A.; Michalak, J.; Schneider, S.; Margraf, J.","Prevalence rates for mental health problems are higher when an individual's socioeconomic status (SES) is low, but the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. We investigated associations between education as indicator for SES and depressive symptoms as well as positive mental health (PMH). Moreover, we hypothesized that low education is associated with a lack of psychosocial resources and more daily hassles, which in turn mediate the relationships between education and mental health. In a German representative sample (N = 7937), we cross-sectionally first examined whether a person's educational level was associated with depressive symptoms and PMH. Educational level was defined as the highest academic qualification achieved. Second, we investigated whether also sense of control, resilience, delay of gratification, cultural activity and daily hassles followed gradients along the educational level. Third, we investigated whether they mediated the relationship between education and mental health. Results showed that depressive symptoms measured by items from the DASS-42 depression subscale were more prevalent for persons with a low educational level, PMH operationalized by the Positive Mental Health Scale was equally distributed, and all psychosocial characteristics followed the gradient of educational level. In addition, the group with a high school diploma was particularly burdened. Structural equation modeling indicated that the associations between education and mental health were mediated by all psychosocial characteristics and daily hassles, apart from the delay of gratification. In the group with the lowest educational level the model fit indices for depressive symptoms and PMH were acceptable (chi2 = 10007.243 (627), CFI = 0.869, RMSEA = 0.04 (90% CI [0.04, 0.04], SRMR = 0.05; and chi2 = 12779.968 (741), CFI = 0.86, RMSEA = 0.05 (90% CI [0.05, 0.05], SRMR = 0.05), respectively). The effect size P(m) refers to the proportion of the total effect that is mediated by one or more variables (""M""), and the effect size of all indirect effects in the model for depressive symptoms was P(m) = .80 and for PMH it was P(m) = .68. The results support our hypotheses that low education is associated with less psychosocial resources, which in turn serve together with daily hassles as pathways between education and depressive symptoms as well as PMH. Building on these findings, longitudinal studies are necessary to investigate causality.",2019,Apr,SSM Popul Health,7,,100392,30989104.0,10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100392,,#1618,Niemeyer 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
It is more than Interference: Examining the neurohemodynamic correlates of the flanker task with functional near-infrared spectroscopy,"Geissler Geissler, C. F.; Hofmann, M. J.; Frings, C.","Previous functional near-infrared spectroscopy studies using the Eriksen flanker task, in contrast to functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, revealed the quite puzzling finding of an inverted conflict effect, that is, greater middle and superior frontal activation in response compatible than in response incompatible trials. However, since neither prior functional near-infrared spectroscopy studies nor most previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies separated between an identical and a compatible condition, it is hard to pinpoint whether this discrepancy occurs on the level of stimulus processing or response generation. By assigning two letters to both left (D, F) and right (J, K) hand reactions, we were able to separate identical (e.g., JJJ) and compatible (e.g., JKJ) conditions that solely differ in their stimulus congruency. Replicating prior functional magnetic resonance imaging findings, we found the standard conflict effect at the transition of superior and middle frontal gyrus, when comparing the activation in compatible trials to that in incompatible trials. Both changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin thus pointed to more effortful processing in incompatible trials. Interestingly, however, identical trials showed the highest activation in this region, according to both changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. A finding that mirrors and extends prior functional near-infrared spectroscopy findings, which only regarded oxygenated blood. We argue that this pattern of results does not reflect the standard conflict effect. We rather assume that other processes like perceptual familiarity or strategic readjustment might be at play.",2020,Aug,Eur J Neurosci,52,3,3022-3031,32090396.0,10.1111/ejn.14708,,#1619,GeisslerGeissler 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Eighteen patients with MDD and 16 healthy controls performed an active and an observational probabilistic reward-learning task while event- related potentials were recorded. Also, participants were assessed with regard to self-reported cognitive and affective trait empathy. Relative to healthy controls, patients with MDD showed overall impaired learning and attenuated FRN amplitudes, irrespective of feedback valence and learning type (active vs. observational), but comparable P300 amplitudes.

Event-related potentials of emotional and neutral memories: The role of encoding position and delayed testing,"Wirkner, J.; Ventura-Bort, C.; Schulz, P.; Hamm, A. O.; Weymar, M.","Previous research found that memory is not only better for emotional information but also for neutral information that has been encoded in the context of an emotional event. In the present ERP study, we investigated two factors that may influence memory for neutral and emotional items: temporal proximity between emotional and neutral items during encoding, and retention interval (immediate vs. delayed). Forty-nine female participants incidentally encoded 36 unpleasant and 108 neutral pictures (36 neutral pictures preceded an unpleasant picture, 36 followed an unpleasant picture, and 36 neutral pictures were preceded and followed by neutral pictures) and participated in a recognition memory task either immediately (N = 24) or 1 week (N = 25) after encoding. Results showed better memory for emotional pictures relative to neutral pictures. In accordance, enhanced centroparietal old/new differences (500-900 ms) during recognition were observed for unpleasant compared to neutral pictures, most pronounced for the 1-week interval. Picture position effects, however, were only subtle. During encoding, late positive potentials for neutral pictures were slightly lower for neutral pictures following unpleasant ones, but only at trend level. To summarize, we could replicate and extend previous ERP findings showing that emotionally arousing events are better recollected than neutral events, particularly when memory is tested after longer retention intervals. Picture position during encoding, however, had only small effects on elaborative processing and no effects on memory retrieval.",2018,Jul,Psychophysiology,55,7,e13069,29457220.0,10.1111/psyp.13069,,#1621,Wirkner 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Allocentric information is used for memory-guided reaching in depth: A virtual reality study,"Klinghammer, M.; Schutz, I.; Blohm, G.; Fiehler, K.","Previous research has demonstrated that humans use allocentric information when reaching to remembered visual targets, but most of the studies are limited to 2D space. Here, we study allocentric coding of memorized reach targets in 3D virtual reality. In particular, we investigated the use of allocentric information for memory-guided reaching in depth and the role of binocular and monocular (object size) depth cues for coding object locations in 3D space. To this end, we presented a scene with objects on a table which were located at different distances from the observer and served as reach targets or allocentric cues. After free visual exploration of this scene and a short delay the scene reappeared, but with one object missing (=reach target). In addition, the remaining objects were shifted horizontally or in depth. When objects were shifted in depth, we also independently manipulated object size by either magnifying or reducing their size. After the scene vanished, participants reached to the remembered target location on the blank table. Reaching endpoints deviated systematically in the direction of object shifts, similar to our previous results from 2D presentations. This deviation was stronger for object shifts in depth than in the horizontal plane and independent of observer-target-distance. Reaching endpoints systematically varied with changes in object size. Our results suggest that allocentric information is used for coding targets for memory-guided reaching in depth. Thereby, retinal disparity and vergence as well as object size provide important binocular and monocular depth cues.",2016,Dec,Vision Res,129,,13-24,27789230.0,10.1016/j.visres.2016.10.004,,#1622,Klinghammer 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Emotional interference under low versus high executive control,"Grutzmann, R.; Riesel, A.; Kaufmann, C.; Kathmann, N.; Heinzel, S.","Previous research has demonstrated that task-irrelevant emotional distractors interfere with task performance especially under low phasic executive control (i.e., in nonconflict trials). In the present study, we measured medio-frontal ERPs (N2 and correct-related negativity, CRN) to elucidate which aspects of task performance are affected by emotional interference in a flanker task. To create emotional interference, negative and neutral pictures were presented during the flanker stimuli. N2 and CRN were reduced after negative pictures, indicating that conflict processing and performance monitoring are both affected by emotional interference. On the behavioral level, prolonged response times after negative pictures were observed under low phasic executive control (i.e., in compatible trials). Additionally, we explored whether emotional interference is modulated not only by phasic changes in executive control (i.e., conflict vs. nonconflict trials) but also by tonic changes in executive control (i.e., low vs. high overall conflict frequency). To this end, the flanker task consisted of two blocks with 25% versus 75% incompatible trials.

Aroused at Home: Basic Autonomic Regulation during Orthostatic and Physical Activation is Altered in Children with Social Anxiety Disorder,"Asbrand, J.; Blechert, J.; Nitschke, K.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.; Schmitz, J.","Previous research has documented altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity to laboratory-based social stress tasks in children with social anxiety disorder (SAD). It is unclear, however, whether these alterations are caused by the unfamiliar and possibly threatening lab environment or whether they generalize to other, more representative contexts. Sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic functioning was assessed in the home (minimizing environmental threat) during a supine baseline phase and two physical activation phases (orthostatic stress, stair stepping) in children (9-13 years) with SAD (n = 27) and healthy control children (n = 27). Relative to controls, children with SAD showed tonic autonomic hyperarousal as indicated by higher heart rate and electrodermal activity during the supine baseline phase. Further, there was evidence for stronger cardiac and vascular sympathetic reactivity (T-wave amplitude, pulse wave transit time) to moderate physical activation in children with SAD. Higher autonomic arousal during rest was related to measures of trait social anxiety and general psychopathology. Groups did not differ on parasympathetic parameters. Our results extend previous laboratory findings and provide the first evidence for alterations in children with SAD during basal autonomic regulation and in the absence of explicit social evaluative threat. They may further help to clarify conflicting study results from previous laboratory studies. The findings underline the importance of psychophysiological assessment using different environments and tasks to elucidate the physiological bases of SAD.",2017,Jan,J Abnorm Child Psychol,45,1,143-155,27037916.0,10.1007/s10802-016-0147-7,,#1624,Asbrand 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Scene Configuration and Object Reliability Affect the Use of Allocentric Information for Memory-Guided Reaching,"Klinghammer, M.; Blohm, G.; Fiehler, K.","Previous research has shown that egocentric and allocentric information is used for coding target locations for memory-guided reaching movements. Especially, task-relevance determines the use of objects as allocentric cues. Here, we investigated the influence of scene configuration and object reliability as a function of task-relevance on allocentric coding for memory-guided reaching. For that purpose, we presented participants images of a naturalistic breakfast scene with five objects on a table and six objects in the background. Six of these objects served as potential reach-targets (= task-relevant objects). Participants explored the scene and after a short delay, a test scene appeared with one of the task-relevant objects missing, indicating the location of the reach target. After the test scene vanished, participants performed a memory-guided reaching movement toward the target location. Besides removing one object from the test scene, we also shifted the remaining task-relevant and/or task-irrelevant objects left- or rightwards either coherently in the same direction or incoherently in opposite directions. By varying object coherence, we manipulated the reliability of task-relevant and task-irrelevant objects in the scene. In order to examine the influence of scene configuration (distributed vs. grouped arrangement of task-relevant objects) on allocentric coding, we compared the present data with our previously published data set (Klinghammer et al., 2015). We found that reaching errors systematically deviated in the direction of object shifts, but only when the objects were task-relevant and their reliability was high. However, this effect was substantially reduced when task-relevant objects were distributed across the scene leading to a larger target-cue distance compared to a grouped configuration. No deviations of reach endpoints were observed in conditions with shifts of only task-irrelevant objects or with low object reliability irrespective of task-relevancy. Moreover, when solely task-relevant objects were shifted incoherently, the variability of reaching endpoints increased compared to coherent shifts of task-relevant objects. Our results suggest that the use of allocentric information for coding targets for memory-guided reaching depends on the scene configuration, in particular the average distance of the reach target to task-relevant objects, and the reliability of task-relevant allocentric information.",2017,2017/04/13,Front Neurosci,11,,204,28450826.0,10.3389/fnins.2017.00204,,#1625,Klinghammer 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

"Applied relaxation and cortisol secretion: findings from a randomized controlled indicated prevention trial in adults with stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms","Kische, H.; Zenker, M.; Pieper, L.; Beesdo-Baum, K.; Asselmann, E.","Previous research has shown that relaxation interventions can reduce distress, anxiety, and depression. The exact mechanisms that underlie the efficacy of relaxation interventions remain unresolved. This study aimed to investigate whether applied relaxation (AR) leads to changes in cortisol secretion and whether these effects mediate fewer symptoms due to AR. Data come from a randomized controlled preventive interventional trial (N = 277) with elevated tension/distress, anxiety, or depressive symptomatology. Participants were randomized to an intervention group (IG; n = 139, received AR training), or a non-interventional control group (CG, n = 138). Psychopathological symptoms were assessed with DASS-21 and diagnoses of mental disorders via DIA-X-5. Cortisol was measured as short-term index in saliva (six times/d for 2 d at pre-, post-, and follow-up [FU] assessment) and long-term index in hair samples (once at pre-assessment and FU, respectively). Data were analyzed as pre-specified secondary analyses of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) on completer basis (n = 134 CG, n = 102 IG), using multivariable-adjusted linear regression models and mediation analyses (the DASS-21 change in the IG vs. CG with cortisol (area under the curve [AUC]) as mediator). From pre- to post-assessment, total daily salivary cortisol (AUC) decreased more strongly in the IG vs. CG (beta-coefficient: -13.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -26.85 to -0.81), but was rendered non-significant when adjusting for pre-assessment AUC.

In the present study, we therefore tested emotional and neutral scene processing and later recognition memory in female participants using hair cortisol concentrations as a biological marker for chronic stress. Event-related potentials recorded during picture viewing indicated enhanced late positive potentials (LPPs) for emotional, relative to neutral contents. These brain potentials varied as a function of long-term hair cortisol levels: hair-cortisol levels were positively related to overall LPP amplitudes. Results from recognition memory testing one week after encoding revealed better memory for emotional relative to neutral scenes. Hair-cortisol levels, however, were related to poorer memory accuracy. Taken together, our results indicate that chronic stress enhanced attentional processing during encoding of new stimuli and impaired later recognition memory.

Therefore, fear generalization is considered a key mechanism for the development of anxiety disorders. However, systematic investigations on the variance in fear generalization are lacking. Therefore, the current study aims at identifying distinctive phenotypes of fear generalization among healthy participants. To this end, 1175 participants completed a differential fear conditioning phase followed by a generalization test. To identify patterns of fear generalization, we used a k-means clustering algorithm based on individual arousal generalization gradients. Subsequently, we examined the reliability and validity of the clusters and phenotypical differences between subgroups on the basis of psychometric data and markers of fear expression. Cluster analysis reliably revealed five clusters that systematically differed in mean responses, differentiation between conditioned threat and safety, and linearity of the generalization gradients, though mean response levels accounted for most variance. Remarkably, the patterns of mean responses were already evident during fear acquisition and corresponded most closely to psychometric measures of anxiety traits. The identified clusters reliably described subgroups of healthy individuals with distinct response characteristics in a fear generalization test. Following a dimensional view of psychopathology, these clusters likely delineate risk factors for anxiety disorders.

H.; Blechert, J.","Previous research on autonomic characteristics of social anxiety in children and adolescents has produced highly inconsistent results which may partially be due to task differences and a limited breadth of autonomic measurement. Here we investigated a sample of high (HSA) and low socially anxious (LSA) children, aged 10-12 years before, during and after a standardized evaluated speech task while acquiring a broad set of autonomic and experiential measures. During baseline, we found evidence for tonically higher sympathetic autonomic activity in HSA children, indicated by higher low frequency heart rate variability (LF) and a trend for higher LF to high frequency heart rate variability ratios (LF/HF). In response to the speech task, HSA children showed blunted cardiac responding evidenced by slower increase and delayed recovery of heart rate and a similar significant trend on LF/HF values. Self-reported anxiety, by contrast, showed enhanced reactivity from baseline to anticipation in the HSA compared to the LSA group. The results suggest a restricted cardiac flexibility in HSA children and illustrate that broad autonomic assessment during a well-structured, naturalistic task may improve our understanding of the autonomic physiology of socially anxious children.

Training approach-avoidance of smiling faces affects emotional vulnerability in socially anxious individuals,"Rinck, M.; Telli, S.; Kampmann, I. L.; Woud, M. L.; Kerstholt, M.; Te Velthuis, S.; Wittkowski, M.; Becker, E. S.","PREVIOUS RESEARCH REVEALED AN AUTOMATIC BEHAVIORAL BIAS IN HIGH SOCIALLY ANXIOUS INDIVIDUALS (HSAS): although their explicit evaluations of smiling faces are positive, they show automatic avoidance of these faces. This is reflected by faster pushing than pulling of smiling faces in an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT; Heuer et al., 2007). The current study addressed the causal role of this avoidance bias for social anxiety. To this end, we used the AAT to train HSAs, either to approach smiling faces or to avoid them. We examined whether such an AAT training could change HSAs' automatic avoidance tendencies, and if yes, whether AAT effects would generalize to a new approach task with new facial stimuli, and to mood and anxiety in a social threat situation (a video-recorded self-presentation). We found that HSAs trained to approach smiling faces did indeed approach female faces faster after the training than HSAs trained to avoid smiling faces. Moreover, approach-faces training reduced emotional vulnerability: it led to more positive mood and lower anxiety after the self-presentation than avoid-faces training. These results suggest that automatic approach-avoidance tendencies have a causal role in social anxiety, and that they can be modified by a simple computerized training. This may open new avenues in the therapy of social phobia.",2013,,Front Hum Neurosci,7,,481,23970862.0,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00481,,#1633,Rinck 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Dyadic Coping and Its Underlying Neuroendocrine Mechanisms - Implications for Stress Regulation,"Zietlow, A.

The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), while regulating stress-sensitive HPA-axis activity might be crucial in this process. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of dyadic coping abilities and OT on HPA-axis outcomes and constructive behavior during couple conflict. We conducted a secondary analysis of our previous database (Ditzen et al., 2009), assessing the modulating role of dyadic coping and intranasal OT on couple conflict behavior. The data revealed a significant interaction effect of the dyadic coping by oneself score and OT on cortisol responses during couple conflict, suggesting that particularly individuals with low a priori dyadic coping benefit from OT in terms of dampened HPA-activity. The results are in line with previous research suggesting OT's central role for stress regulation and prosocial behavior. Furthermore, an interaction with dyadic coping indicates adaptations in the sensitivity of the OT system during the individual attachment and relationship history. These data add to the evidence that the neuroendocrine attachment systems influence couple behavior.

However, the relationships between the mutual attachments in the dyads of emerging adults and their parents are still unclear. Our study examines the stability and change in dyadic attachment. We asked 574 emerging adults and 463 parents at four occasions over 1 year about their mutual attachments. We used a latent state-trait model with autoregressive effects to estimate the time consistency of the attachments. Attachment was very stable, and earlier measurement occasions could explain more than 60% of the reliable variance. Changes of attachment over time showed an accumulation of situational effects for emerging adults but not for their parents. We estimated the correlations of the mutual attachments over time using a novel multi-rater latent state-trait model with autoregressive effects. This model showed that the mutual attachments of parents and emerging adults were moderately to highly correlated. Our model allows to separate the stable attachment from the changing attachment. The correlations between the mutual attachments were higher for the stable elements of attachment than for the changing elements of attachment.

Attentional Selection of Social Features Persists Despite Restricted Bottom-Up Information and Affects Temporal Viewing Dynamics,"Flechsenhar, A.; Rosler, L.; Gamer, M.","Previous studies have shown an attentional bias towards social features during free-viewing of naturalistic scenes. This social attention seems to be reflexive and able to defy top-down demands in form of explicit search tasks. However, the question remains whether social features continue to be prioritized when peripheral information is limited, thereby reducing the influence of bottom-up image information on gaze orienting. Therefore, we established a gaze-contingent viewing paradigm, in which the visual field was constrained and updated in response to the viewer's eye movements. Participants viewed social and non-social images that were randomly allocated to a free and a gaze-contingent viewing condition while their eye movements were tracked. Our results revealed a strong attentional bias towards social features in both conditions. However, gaze-contingent viewing altered temporal and spatial dynamics of viewing behavior. Additionally, recurrent fixations were more frequent and closer together in time for social compared to non-social stimuli in both viewing conditions.

Child abuse predicts adult PTSD symptoms among individuals diagnosed with intellectual disabilities,"Catani, C.; Sossalla, I. M.","Prior research has shown that people with intellectual disabilities (ID) are more likely to experience child abuse as well as other forms of traumatic or negative events later in life compared to the general population. Little is known however, about the association of these experiences with adult mental health in intellectually disabled individuals. The present study aimed to assess whether child abuse in families and institutions as well as other types of adverse life events, were associated with current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms in individuals with ID. We conducted clinical interviews which included standardized self-report measures for childhood abuse, PTSD, and depression in an unselected sample of 56 persons with a medical diagnosis of ID who were attending a specialized welfare center. The frequency of traumatic experiences was very high, with physical and emotional child abuse being the most common trauma types. 87% of the persons reported at least one aversive experience on the family violence spectrum, and 50% of the sample reported a violent physical attack later in adulthood. 25% were diagnosed with PTSD and almost 27% had a critical score on the depression scale. Physical and emotional child abuse was positively correlated with the amount of institutional violence and the number of general traumatic events, whereas childhood sexual abuse was related to the experience of intimate partner violence in adult life. A linear regression model revealed child abuse in the family to be the only significant independent predictor of PTSD symptom severity. The current findings underscore the central role of child maltreatment in the increased risk of further victimization and in the development of mental health problems in adulthood in intellectually disabled individuals.

The Relevance of Infant Outcome Measures: A Pilot-RCT Comparing Baby Triple P Positive Parenting Program With Care as Usual,"Popp, L.; Fuths, S.; Schneider, S.","Problems in infant mental health such as the ability to experience, regulate, and express emotional states is expressed in behavioral problems like excessive crying, feeding, and sleeping problems. Parenting programs are popular but their effectiveness on infant mental health remains uncertain. Possibly, because recent studies have focused only on parental and parent-child measures while they miss to assess infant behavioral measures. The goal of this pilot study is to fill in this gap by assessing infantile behavioral measures. We investigated the acceptance and first indicators of efficacy of the universal group parenting training Baby Triple P (BTP) compared to a care as usual (CAU) control condition focusing on early behavioral problems. In all, 49 couples were randomly allocated to receive either eight BTP sessions before birth and per telephone after birth or to take part in CAU. Infant behavior was assessed with a diary and a structured diagnostic interview. Parental self-report measures of partnership quality and parental competence were assessed before birth, 10 weeks after birth and at 6-month follow-up. Since the parent training was conducted before the birth of the child, the child's mental health could not be assessed before the parent training. Thus, for this variable no within measurement (pre-post) could be carried out and intention-to-treat analysis was not possible. However, a between group analysis comparing BTP against CAU took place to assess effectiveness of BTP on children's mental health. Mothers and fathers rated the program as feasible and relevant. Results indicate significant group differences in crying behavior 6 months after birth to the benefit of the intervention group. No beneficial outcomes were found for feeding and sleeping problems in infants or partnership quality, parental sense of competence in parents. Due to an unrepresentative high level of education of the participating parents and the small sample size, these findings can be considered preliminary. Nevertheless, these results allow to further investigate the effectivity of BTP in large-scale clinical trials. Behavioral diaries or diagnostic interviews for early mental health problems should be routinely implemented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in order not to miss possible behavioral changes in infants.

NMDA receptor modulation by dextromethorphan and acute stress selectively alters electroencephalographic indicators of partial report processing,"Weckesser, L. J.; Enge, S.; Riedel, P.; Kirschbaum, C.; Miller, R.","Proceeding from a biophysical network model, the present study hypothesized that glutamatergic neurotransmission across the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) plays a key role in visual perception and its modulation by acute stress. To investigate these hypotheses, behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) indicators of partial report task processing were assessed in twenty-four healthy young men who randomly received a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist (0.8 mg/kg dextromethorphan, DXM) or a placebo, and concurrently accomplished a stress-induction (MAST) or control protocol in three consecutive sessions. Saliva samples served to quantify cortisol responses to the MAST, whereas a passive auditory oddball paradigm was implemented to verify the impact of DXM on the EEG-derived mismatch negativity component (MMN). DXM administration significantly increased MMN amplitudes but not salivary cortisol concentrations. By contrast, concurrent MAST exposure significantly reduced MMN latencies but also increased cortisol concentrations. With regard to EEG indicators, DXM administration reduced visually ""evoked"" (30Hz to 50Hz) and ""induced"" occipital gamma-band activity (70Hz to 100Hz), which was partly compensated by additional MAST exposure. However, neither the interventions nor EEG activity were significantly associated with behavioral partial report sensitivities. In summary, the present data suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission across the NMDAR is only one among many determinants of intact visual perception. Accordingly, therapeutic doses of DXM and their inhibitory modulation by stress probably yield more pronounced electroencephalographic as compared with behavioural effects.",2017,Oct,Eur Neuropsychopharmacol,27,10,1042-1053,28739134.0,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.07.003,,#1647,Weckesser 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Particularly, promising evidence stems from research using hair cortisol analysis which allows for a reliable assessment of cortisol secretion over several months. Another variable that has been linked to both HCC and non-response to treatment is childhood maltreatment (CM). In order to examine the predictive value of pre-treatment hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), treatment-related changes in HCC as well as CM for changes in PTSD symptomatology, we set up a prospective study in which we followed 52 female PTSD patients over the course of a trauma-focused inpatient treatment. Specifically, 3-month integrated HCC were assessed at treatment entry, at discharge and on average five months later accompanied by assessments of PTSD, overall and depressive symptomatology. CM was measured at treatment entry. Self-report indices improved following inpatient treatment. No evidence for pre-treatment HCC to be associated with changes in PTSD symptoms was revealed. However, attenuated pre-treatment HCC predicted less improvement in overall symptomatology from treatment entry to discharge. This effect lost significance after adjusting for baseline dissociative symptoms. Neither changes in HCC nor CM were predictive of treatment response. Pre-treatment cross-sectional analyses revealed no association between HCC and CM.

Eye contact during live social interaction in incarcerated psychopathic offenders,"Gehrer, N. A.; Duchowski, A. T.; Jusyte, A.; Schonenberg, M.","Psychopathy is characterized by a lack of empathy, callousness, and a range of severe antisocial behaviors. A deficit to accurately process social cues, which has been widely documented in psychopathic populations, is assumed to underlie their pathological development. Impaired attention to socially salient cues, such as the eyes of an interaction partner, is a possible mechanism compromising the development of social cognition. Preliminary evidence from static facial stimuli suggests that psychopathy is indeed linked to reduced eye gaze. However, no study to date has investigated whether these mechanisms apply to naturalistic interactions. This study is the first to examine patterns of visual attention during live social interactions and their association with symptom clusters of psychopathy. Eye contact was assessed in a sample of incarcerated offenders (N = 30) during semistructured face-to-face interactions with a mobile eye-tracking headset and analyzed using a novel automated areas of interest (e.g., eye region) labeling technique. The interactions included an exchange on neutral predetermined topics and included a condition in which the participants were active (talking) and passive (listening). The data reveal that across both listening and talking conditions higher affective psychopathy is a significant predictor of reduced eye contact (listening: r = -.39; talking: r = -.43). The present findings are in line with previous research suggesting impaired attention to social cues in psychopathy. This study is the first to document these deficits in naturalistic, live social interaction and therefore provides important evidence for their relevance to real-life behavior.

Situational expectations mediate the effect of global beliefs on depressive symptoms: a 1-year prospective study using a student sample,"Kube, T.; Glombiewski, J.

The present study aimed to further specify the role of situation-specific dysfunctional expectations (SDEs) in the development of depressive symptoms. It was hypothesized that the effects of intermediate beliefs and dispositional optimism on depressive symptoms would be mediated via SDEs. RECENT FINDINGS: We examined 125 students (age M = 22.05, SD = 4.00, 74.6% women) using a longitudinal design with a 1-year follow-up. Questionnaires used in the study included the Depressive Expectations Scale, Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, Life Orientation Test and Beck's Depression Inventory. When considering SDEs at baseline as mediator variable, neither intermediate beliefs nor dispositional optimism had significant direct effects on depressive symptoms. Instead, their effects were fully mediated via SDEs. When considering SDEs at the follow-up as the mediator variable, SDEs partly mediated the effects of intermediate beliefs and dispositional optimism on depressive symptoms. SUMMARY: The study provides further evidence for a cognitive mediational model, suggesting that SDEs mediate the effects of rather global beliefs (such as intermediate beliefs and dispositional optimism) on depressive symptoms. Due to their high level of situational specificity, SDEs might be an effective target for cognitive-behavioural interventions.",2018,Sep,Curr Opin Psychiatry,31,5,409-416,30024420.0,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000443,,#1653,Kube 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Treatment Expectations Towards Different Pain Management Approaches: Two Perspectives,"Schemer, L.; Rief, W.; Glombiewski, J.

Expectations among treatment caregivers, however, are often neglected. Despite international treatment guidelines, only a small minority of chronic pain patients undergo psychological interventions. Therefore, our aim was to explore expectations among treatment receivers and caregivers especially concerning their attitudes towards psychological pain treatments. METHODS: Two hundred ten (potential) treatment receivers (n=85 individuals suffering from chronic low back pain (CLBP); n=125 healthy controls) and 237 caregivers (n=75 physicians; n=64 psychotherapists; n=98 physiotherapists) provided ratings of expected treatment success for standardized vignettes describing patients suffering from CLBP and undergoing a pharmacological, psychological, or multimodal pain management program. RESULTS: Individuals suffering from CLBP generally had lower treatment expectations than healthy controls. Both psychotherapists and physicians had higher treatment expectations from their own individual treatment approach. All participants expected the multimodal approach to be most effective. The psychological approach was expected to be more effective than the pharmacological approach - except for the physicians, who expected both treatment approaches to be equally effective. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to clarify, under which circumstances and how patient expectations can be altered among individuals suffering from CLBP. Our results appear to encourage the implementation of multimodal and psychological pain management approaches across various settings. We invite clinicians to reflect whether their own expectations are in line with the recommendations in international treatment guidelines.",2020,2020/07,J Pain Res,13,,1725-1736,32753946.0,10.2147/JPR.S247177,,#1655,Schemer 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Influence of executive functions on the self-reported health-related quality of life of children with ADHD,"Schworer, M. C.; Reinelt, T.; Petermann, F.; Petermann, U.","PURPOSE: ADHD is regarded as a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with deficits in executive functions (EF). The presence of these deficits is associated with increased symptom severity. However, so far there is little knowledge, whether deficits in EFs relate to a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children with ADHD. METHODS: Hence, n = 100 children with a confirmed ADHD diagnosis were compared with a non-cases group (n = 100) with regard to their HRQoL (6-12 years old). The clinical group was divided into ADHD-specific drug treatment intake (drug treatment: n = 42; no drug treatment: n = 58) or deficits in EF (n = 29; no deficits in EF: n = 71). RESULTS: Children with ADHD (without medication) reported a significantly worse HRQoL than healthy children (d = .72), when controlled for age and sex. Even if they were treated with drug treatment, they reported a lower HRQoL than the non-case group in the area Family (d = .53). Drug treatment of ADHD leads to a significant difference in HRQoL in school area (d = .39). Children with ADHD and EF problems reported impairments in the social context of HRQoL compared to healthy children (d = .51 to .70). In addition, a significant negative association between set-shifting and HRQoL in children with ADHD (without drug treatment) was demonstrated (r = - .27 to r = - .35). CONCLUSIONS: By assessing the HRQoL, an impairment in the functioning of children with ADHD can be detected, which is essential for the diagnosis. Furthermore, executive problems have an influence on the social sphere, which should be clarified and improved in therapy with the involvement of parents.",2020,May,Qual Life Res,29,5,1183-1192,31900765.0,10.1007/s11136-019-02394-4,,#1657,Schworer 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Orthorexic eating behavior in patients with somatoform disorders,"Barthels, F.; Muller, R.; Schuth, T.; Friederich, H. C.; Pietrowsky, R.","PURPOSE: Although anecdotal reports suggest a relation between orthorexic eating behavior and symptoms of somatoform disorders, this issue has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to compare orthorexic eating behavior and other characteristics of disordered eating behavior in patients with somatoform disorders to a sample of healthy controls. METHODS: 31 patients with somatoform disorders and 30 matched controls completed eight questionnaires, i.a., the Dusseldorf Orthorexia Scale, three scales of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2, Eating Attitudes Test-26, Multidimensional Inventory of Hypochondriacal Traits, Attitudes Towards Body and Health Questionnaire, and Screening for Somatoform Disorders. RESULTS: The patients displayed higher levels of orthorexic eating behavior, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, bulimia, and dieting than the control group. In both groups, orthorexic eating behavior was associated with higher levels of somatization in eating and health habits. The control group showed an association of orthorexic eating behavior with catastrophizing cognitions and the perceptual component of health anxiety. CONCLUSION: The results support the hypothesis of a connection between orthorexic eating behavior and somatoform disorders. However, patients with somatoform disorders do not seem to be at particular risk for orthorexia. Future studies should investigate causes for the relationship between orthorexic eating behavior and characteristics of somatoform disorders in samples of healthy individuals.

Quality of life among parents seeking treatment for their child's functional abdominal pain,"Calvano, C.; Warschburger, P.","PURPOSE: Dealing with a child who suffers from functional abdominal pain (FAP) is a major challenge for the child's parents. However, little is known about the quality of life (QoL) of this group of parents. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of parental QoL among parents seeking treatment for their child's abdominal pain. METHODS: 133 parents of 7-13-year-old children diagnosed with FAP reported on their health-related QoL (HRQoL), as assessed by the SF-12, and on caregiver-related QoL, as assessed by two CHQ-PF50 scales (emotional impact, time impact). T tests were used to compare the parents' scores on these measures with reference scores. Subgroups which were at risk of impairment were defined by cut-off scores. Determinants of parental QoL were identified by hierarchical regression analyses. RESULTS: While the parents showed significantly poorer mental health compared to population-based reference samples (d = 0.33-0.58), their physical health did not differ. However, parents were severely strained with respect to the time impact and emotional impact of their child's health (d = 0.33-1.58). While 12.7-27.9% of the parents were at risk of poor HRQoL, 60.6-70.1% were highly strained due to the demands of their role as caregivers. Physical and mental health were best explained by parents' psychiatric symptoms, while parents' perception of their child's impairment additionally determined the high time and emotional impact. CONCLUSIONS: Physical HRQoL is not impaired in the majority of parents seeking treatment for their child's functional abdominal pain. However, the time demands and worries due to the child's pain deserve specific attention. Psychosocial interventions for a child's FAP should include information provided to the parents about coping with time constraints and emotional impact.

Decreasing the Burden of Side Effects Through Positive Message Framing: an Experimental Proof-of-Concept Study,"Wilhelm, M.; Rief, W.; Doering, B. K.","PURPOSE: Informing patients about treatment side effects increases the occurrence and intensity of side effects. Since the obligatory informed consent procedure in drug treatments requires transparency and nocebo research suggests that the informed consent of a drug leads to an increased occurrence of the mentioned side effects, the aim of this proof of concept study was to determine the effect of two different framings of informed consent on the occurrence, intensity, and perceived threat of side effects. METHODS: Healthy male participants (n = 80) were randomized to one of two framing groups. The positive framing group was informed that the common side effect dizziness was a sign that the drug had started to work, while the neutral framing group was told that dizziness is an unpleasant but well-known side effect. Side effects were measured after the administration of metoprolol, an antihypertensive agent. Post hoc moderator analyses investigated the effect of pre-existing negative beliefs about the general harm of medication on the framing manipulation. RESULTS: Metoprolol-specific drug-attributed side effects were rated significantly less threatening in the positive framing group. The between-group effect size (Cohen's d) was small (d = 0.38, p = 0.049). Exploratory post hoc moderator analyses suggest that participants who believed that medication is a source of harmful effects benefited from positive framing, compared to neutral framing of drug-attributed side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Positive framing was partially effective in decreasing specific side effect measures, particularly among participants with a tendency to believe that medicine is harmful. Informed consent procedures should therefore be personalized, focusing on patients with negative treatment beliefs.",2018,Aug,Int J Behav Med,25,4,381-389,29785686.0,10.1007/s12529-018-9726-z,,#1660,Wilhelm 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Mild Depression in Low Back Pain: the Interaction of Thought Suppression and Stress Plays a Role, Especially in Female Patients","Konietzny, K.; Chehadi, O.; Streitlein-Bohme, I.; Rusche, H.; Willburger, R.; Hasenbring, M. I.","PURPOSE: Mild depression has been shown as a precursor and as a consequence of low back pain, even in early phases of acute or subacute pain. Chronic daily life stress as well as dysfunctional pain-related cognitions such as thought suppression (TS) seem to play a role in the pain-depression cycle; however, the mechanisms of these associations are less understood. Experimentally induced TS, conceived as the attempt to directly suppress sensations such as pain, has been shown to paradoxically cause a delayed and non-volitional return of the suppressed thoughts and sensations and to increase affective distress. These dysfunctional processes are supposed to increase under high cognitive load, such as high stress. METHOD: In the present cross-sectional study, we for the first time sought to examine a possible interaction between habitual TS and stress on depression in N = 177 patients with subacute low back pain (SLBP), using the following questionnaires: Subscale Thought Suppression from Avoidance-Endurance Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and Kiel Interview of Subjective Situation. A three-way ANOVA was conducted with two groups of TS (high/low), stress (high/low) and sex as independent factors and depression as dependent. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant three-way interaction with highest depression scores in female patients showing high TS and high stress. Overall main effects for sex and stress indicated higher depression in women and in highly stressed patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that TS heightens depressive mood under conditions of high cognitive load especially in female patients with SLBP indicating a special vulnerability for depressive mood in women with SLBP.",2018,Apr,Int J Behav Med,25,2,207-214,28523481.0,10.1007/s12529-017-9657-0,,#1661,Konietzny 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Acceptance and barriers to access of occupational e-mental health: cross-sectional findings from a health-risk population of employees,"Hennemann, S.; Witthoft, M.; Bethge, M.; Spanier, K.; Beutel, M. E.; Zwerenz, R.","PURPOSE: Occupational e-mental-health (OEMH) may extend existing instruments for preservation or restoration of health and work ability. As a key precondition to efficient implementation, this study examined acceptance and person-centered barriers to potential uptake of OEMH for work-related distress in employees with an elevated risk of early retirement. METHODS: Within the framework of the ""Third German Sociomedical Panel of Employees"", 1829 employees with prior sickness absence payments filled out a self-administered questionnaire. Participants had a mean age of 49.93 years (SD = 4.06). 6.2% indicated prior use of eHealth interventions. Potential predictors of acceptance of OEMH were examined based on the ""Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology"" (UTAUT) extended by work ability, mental health, eHealth literacy and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: 89.1% (n = 1579) showed low to moderate acceptance (M = 2.20, SD = 1.05, range 1-5). A path analysis revealed significant, positive direct effects of UTAUT predictors on acceptance (performance expectancy: 0.48, SE = 0.02, p < 0.001; effort expectancy: 0.20, SE = 0.02, p < 0.001; social influence: 0.28, SE = 0.02, p < 0.001).Online time and frequency of online health information search were further positive direct predictors of acceptance.

Orthorexic eating behaviour as a coping strategy in patients with anorexia nervosa,"Barthels, F.; Meyer, F.; Huber, T.; Pietrowsky, R.","PURPOSE: Orthorexia nervosa is defined as the fixation on health-conscious eating behaviour and has recently been discussed as a new variant of disordered eating. The aim of the present study was to analyse orthorexic eating behaviour in an inpatient treatment sample of female anorexics to investigate the relation between anorexic and orthorexic eating behaviour. METHOD: Female anorexic patients with low (n = 29) and pronounced (n = 13) orthorexic eating behaviour as well as a matched control group composed of healthy females (n = 30) were compared with regard to several aspects of disordered eating, hypochondriacal traits, food consumption frequency and fulfilment of basic psychological needs in terms of eating. Orthorexic eating behaviour was assessed using the Dusseldorfer Orthorexie Skala. RESULTS: Fulfilment of basic psychological needs with respect to autonomy and competence is higher in anorexic individuals with pronounced orthorexic eating behaviour compared to patients with low orthorexic eating behaviour. Furthermore, patients with pronounced orthorexic eating behaviour state eating healthy food regardless of calorie content more often. No difference was found for hypochondriacal traits and eating disordered symptoms in general.

"Orthorexic and restrained eating behaviour in vegans, vegetarians, and individuals on a diet","Barthels, F.; Meyer, F.; Pietrowsky, R.","PURPOSE: Orthorexic eating behaviour, restrained eating, and veganism/vegetarianism are food selection strategies sharing several characteristics. Since there are no studies investigating their interrelationships, aim of the present study was to analyse orthorexic and restrained eating behaviour in (1) a sample of vegans and vegetarians and (2) a sample of individuals on a diet to lose weight. METHOD: Division of samples according to pre-defined criteria in (1) vegans (n = 114), vegetarians (n = 63), individuals with rare meat consumption (n = 83) and individuals with frequent meat consumption (n = 91) and in (2) participants on a diet with dietary change (n = 104), without dietary change (n = 37) and a control group of individuals not on a diet (n = 258). Orthorexic eating behaviour was assessed with the Dusseldorfer Orthorexie Skala and restrained eating was assessed with the Restraint Eating Scale. RESULTS: Vegans and vegetarians do not differ in orthorexic eating behaviour, but both groups score higher in orthorexic eating behaviour than individuals consuming red meat. There are no differences regarding restrained eating. Individuals on a diet with dietary change score higher in both orthorexic and restrained eating, than individuals without dietary change and individuals not on a diet. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who restrict their eating behaviour, either predominantly due to ethical reasons or with the intention to lose weight, display more orthorexic eating behaviour than individuals not limiting their food consumption. Further research is needed to investigate whether veganism, vegetarianism, or frequent dieting behaviour serve as risk factors for orthorexia.

Dimensional anxiety scales for DSM-5: sensitivity to clinical severity,"Knappe, S.; Klotsche, J.; Strobel, A.; Lebeau, R. T.; Craske, M. G.; Wittchen, H. U.; Beesdo-Baum, K.","PURPOSE: Psychometric properties and clinical sensitivity of brief self-rated dimensional scales to supplement categorical diagnoses of anxiety disorders in the DSM-5 were recently demonstrated in a German treatment seeking sample of adults. The present study aims to demonstrate sensitivity of these scales to clinical severity levels. METHODS: The dimensional scales were administered to 102 adults at a university outpatient clinic for psychotherapy. Diagnostic status was assessed using the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview. To establish a wide range of clinical severity, we considered subthreshold (n=83) and threshold anxiety disorders (n=49, including Social Phobia, Specific Phobia, Agoraphobia, Panic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder). RESULTS: Individuals with either subthreshold or threshold anxiety disorder scored higher on all dimensional scales relative to individuals without anxiety. In addition, individuals with a threshold anxiety disorder scored higher on the dimensional scales than individuals with a subthreshold anxiety disorder (except for specific phobia). Disorder-related impairment ratings, global functioning assessments and number of panic attacks were associated with higher scores on dimensional scales. Findings were largely unaffected by the number of anxiety disorders and comorbid depressive disorders. CONCLUSION: The self-rated dimensional anxiety scales demonstrated sensitivity to clinical severity, and a cut-off based on additional assessment of impairment and distress may assist in the discrimination between subthreshold and threshold anxiety disorders.

Students or medical professionals: whose knowledge improved after social-medicine training? Results from a quasi-experimental evaluation study,"Muschalla, B.; Baron, S.; Klevers, T.","PURPOSE: Rehabilitation professionals are faced with judging and describing the social-medicine status of their patients. Rehabilitation professionals must know the core concepts of acute unfitness for work, psychological capacities, and long-term work capacity. Acquiring and applying this knowledge, requires training. The research question is if and to what extent medical professionals and students' knowledge changes after social medicine training. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was carried out in the real-life context of social medicine training. Psychology students (n = 42), physicians/psychotherapists (i.e. state-licensed health professionals) (n = 44) and medical assistant professionals (n = 29) were trained. Their social medicine knowledge was measured before and after training by a 10-min expert-approved and content valid knowledge questionnaire. Three free-text questions had to be answered on the essential aspects of present and prognostic work ability and psychological capacities. Answers were rated for correctness by two experts. Paired t tests and variance analysis have been calculated for group comparisons. RESULTS: All groups improved their social medicine knowledge from the pre- to the post-test. The students started with the lowest level of knowledge in the pre-test. After training, 69% of the physicians/psychotherapists and 56.8% of the medical assistant professionals, but only 7% of the students, obtained maximum scores for naming psychological capacities.

Predicting Self-Rated Health in Diabetes and Chronic Heart Failure - A Multiple Mediation Model,"Bohme, S.; Renneberg, B.","PURPOSE: Self-rated health (SRH) is a powerful predictor of health-related outcomes such as morbidity and mortality. Aim of the current study was to examine the role of comorbidity, well-being, functional health, and physical limitations as possible predictors of SRH in diabetes and chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS: Three large samples with persons suffering from diabetes (n = 974), CHF (n = 955), or both diseases combined (n = 934) were analyzed longitudinally over the course of 4 months. To test the mediating effect of comorbidity, well-being, functional health, and physical limitations in association with former and future SRH multiple mediator models were applied. RESULTS: Across all groups emotional well-being was a consistent and powerful determinant of SRH. The effects of functional health and physical limitations on SRH were also significant but varied between diagnostic groups. The number of comorbid diseases did not predict SRH. CONCLUSION: Emotional well-being and physical health appraisal were strong predictors of SRH. Thus, SRH may be improved by influencing well-being and physical health appraisal via targeted interventions.",2015,2015/11/25,Front Public Health,3,,266,26636063.0,10.3389/fpubh.2015.00266,,#1668,Bohme 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Somatosensory Amplification Is a Predictor of Self-Reported Side Effects in the Treatment of Primary Hypertension: a Pilot Study,"Doering, B. K.; Szecsi, J.; Bardos, G.; Koteles, F.","PURPOSE: Side effects consist of drug-specific and non-specific symptoms. Both components are based on bodily sensations that a person perceives after taking a drug and subsequently attributes to the drug. We suggest that somatosensory amplification (SSA) may explain a proportion of inter-individual differences in reports of side effects that cannot be accounted for by drug-specific safety profiles. This hypothesis was investigated in hypertensive patients starting a new pharmacotherapy. METHOD: This longitudinal study included 50 patients (66 % women, aged 55 +/- 14 years) with a diagnosis of primary hypertension. Patients completed the Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SSAS), started to take their new medication, and recorded side effects on a daily basis for 4 weeks. RESULTS: After controlling for age, gender, number of pills taken, and previous personal and family experiences with medication side effects in the regression analyses, SSAS scores remained a significant predictor of reported side effects over the entire study period (weeks 1 and 2: beta = .621, p < .001; weeks 3 and 4: beta = .493, p = .003). In a subsample comprising patients taking the four most commonly used drug regimes, SSAS was a significant predictor of side effects, even when controlling for type of medication. CONCLUSION: In this sample of patients undergoing anti-hypertensive pharmacotherapy, higher SSA scores predicted increased reports of medication side effects. To account for this tendency and to improve compliance with medication regimes, this group may require special education about the nocebo phenomenon.",2016,Jun,Int J Behav Med,23,3,327-332,26780634.0,10.1007/s12529-016-9536-0,,#1669,Doering 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Unemployment and mental health in the German population: the role of subjective social status,"Neubert, M.; Sussenbach, P.; Rief, W.; Euteneuer, F.","PURPOSE: Subjective social status (SSS) reflects individuals' perceived position in a social hierarchy. Low SSS is associated with several mental health impairments. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine if unemployed individuals report lower SSS in Germany (national SSS) and lower SSS in their social community (local SSS) than employed individuals. Moreover, the relationship between unemployment, SSS, and mental health was examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 113 unemployed and 1117 employed individuals from a representative German panel provided information on their national and local SSS, their monthly income and their mental health. SSS was assessed with the German version of the MacArthur Scales. Mental health was measured using the mental component scale (MCS) of the SF-12. RESULTS: Unemployed individuals reported significantly lower national SSS, local SSS and mental health compared to employed participants. Mediational analyses suggest that the negative effect of employment status on mental health was explained via a reduction of national SSS. Local SSS did not mediate the association of employment status and mental health. CONCLUSION: Unemployment is associated with lower SSS and reduced mental health.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A sample of 63 patients suffering from insomnia received a six-session sleep intervention, which combined cognitive-behavioral and hypnotherapeutical elements. Due to violating exclusion criteria, data of 37 patients were analyzed. Ten patients had insomnia comorbid with depression, whereas 27 patients had insomnia only. Sleep diaries were implemented to measure various sleep parameters, whereas depressive symptomatology was assessed with the anxiety and depression scale and Symptom-Checklist-90-R at baseline, before and after the intervention, as well as at 3-months follow-up. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms decreased from pre to post measurement and follow-up for patients with insomnia comorbid with depression, whereas scores of patients with only insomnia remained relatively on a low level. Both groups showed a significant increase of sleep efficiency and a significant decrease of the duration of wake after sleep onset. However, only patients with insomnia and depression revealed a significant reduction of sleep-onset latency and a higher level of regeneration. Nondepressive insomniacs, on the other hand, showed a significant increase of performance from post measurement to follow-up. For both groups, no change over time was found for number of wake after sleep onset, total sleep time, mood in the morning and evening.

METHODS: N = 197 young females (age: M = 29.59, SD = 10.85 years) completed an online survey with the following questionnaires: the Dusseldorf Orthorexia Scale to measure orthorexic eating behavior, the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), measuring psychopathological aspects of disordered eating behavior, the Dresden Body Image Questionnaire (DKB-35) to measure five components of body image, and the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), measuring body dissatisfaction. RESULTS: In the total sample, Pearson correlations revealed that orthorexic eating behavior was positively associated with drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction. An independent samples t-Test revealed that females with elevated levels of orthorexic eating behavior (n = 35) displayed higher levels of drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction and lower levels of self-acceptance in comparison to a randomized sample from the remaining females with low levels of orthorexic eating behavior (n = 35). According to a multiple regression analysis, drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction measured by the BSQ served as positive predictors for orthorexic eating behavior, whereas bulimia and body dissatisfaction measured by the EDI-2 served as negative predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal that orthorexic eating behavior is more closely related to psychopathological aspects of other eating disorders than previously assumed. Body dissatisfaction as another major feature of orthorexia nervosa should be taken into account in future studies.

No elevated levels of orthorexic eating behavior in a sample of adults with allergies and food intolerances,"Barthels, F.; Bamberg, L.; Pietrowsky, R.","PURPOSE: To compare orthorexic eating behavior in a sample of adults with and without self-reported allergies and food intolerances. METHODS: N = 52 individuals with and n = 102 individuals without self-reported allergies and food intolerances (80% with medical diagnosis; in total 74.6% female, 23.7% male; age: M = 28.13, SD = 11.96 years) completed an online survey with the Dusseldorf Orthorexia Scale and answered several questions regarding their allergies/intolerances. RESULTS: The groups did not differ in their orthorexic eating behavior. In the sample of individuals with allergies/intolerances, orthorexic eating behavior correlated with the perceived severity of the allergic symptoms and the number of consequences that the allergies had for eating behavior. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous findings, orthorexic eating behavior does not seem to be elevated in individuals with allergies/intolerances. However, focusing on a healthy diet despite adverse food reactions and experiencing a number of allergy-related consequences for one's eating behavior might be associated with orthorexic eating behavior.

Changes in Resident Well-Being at One Institution Across a Decade of Progressive Work Hours Limitations,"Krug, M. F.; Golob, A. L.; Wander, P. L.; Wipf, J. E.","PURPOSE: To measure changes in markers of resident well-being over time as progressive work hours limitations (WHLs) were enforced, and to investigate resident perceptions of the 2011 WHLs. METHOD: A survey study of internal medicine residents was conducted at the University of Washington's multihospital residency program in 2012. The survey included validated well-being questions: the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the two-question PRIME-MD depression screen, and career satisfaction questions. Chi-square tests were used to compare 2012 well-being questionnaire responses against nearly identical surveys conducted in 2001 and 2004 at the same institution. In addition, residents were asked to rate the impact of WHLs on resident well-being and education as well as patient care, and to state preferences for future WHLs. RESULTS: Significantly different proportions of residents met burnout criteria across time, with fewer meeting criteria in 2012 than in 2001 (2001: 76% [87/115]; 2004: 64% [75/118]; 2012: 61% [68/112]; P = .039). Depression screening results also differed across time, with fewer screening positive in 2012 than in 2004 (2001: 45% [52/115]; 2004: 55% [65/118]; 2012 [35/112]: 31%; P = .001). Residents, especially seniors, reported perceived negative impacts of WHLs on their well-being, education, and patient care. Most senior residents favored reverting to the pre-July 2011 system of WHLs. Interns were more divided. CONCLUSIONS: Validated measures of resident well-being changed across the three time points measured. Residents had the lowest rates of burnout and depression in 2012.

Prospective pilot study to identify psychological factors influencing peri-operative pain in total knee arthroplasty (TKA),"Schuster, V.; Kinne, R. W.; Knoll, N.; Konczol, C.; Anders, J. O.","PURPOSE: Up to 20% of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients remain dissatisfied, with chronic pain as the most frequently named cause. A pilot study was conducted to assess the progression of peri-operative pain intensity and the parallel development of different psychological factors and coping strategies, as well as correlations indicating potential inter-relationships. METHODS: Pain, psychological impairment [FESV BE], and coping strategies [FESV BW] were assessed before and after TKA [days - 5 to 31]. Patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of peri-operative pain improvement [decreasing pain: Group 1 [69%; n = 36]; persisting pain: group 2 [31%; n = 16]]. Group 2 was additionally tested with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale [TAS] and Screening for Somatoform Disorders [SOMS]. RESULTS: Pain intensity in group 1 decreased from significantly higher pre-operative levels to significantly lower values at 31 days post-operatively, whereas group 2 did not show significant changes. Concurrently, the psychological impairment parameter anxiety (AN) significantly decreased and the pain coping parameter relaxation significantly increased in group 1, but not in group 2. Whereas pre-operative pain was positively and significantly correlated with AN throughout time in group 2, it was negatively correlated with relaxation at day 29 in group 1. Concerning TAS and SOMS, considerable percentages of the participants in group 2 (37.5% and 68.75%, respectively) showed values > 50% of those in normal controls.

"Workplace phobia, workplace problems, and work ability among primary care patients with chronic mental disorders","Muschalla, B.; Linden, M.","PURPOSE: Work-related anxieties are frequent and have a negative effect on the occupational performance of patients and absence due to sickness. Most important is workplace phobia, that is, panic when approaching or even thinking of the workplace. This study is the first to estimate the prevalence of workplace phobia among primary care patients suffering from chronic mental disorders and to describe which illness-related or workplace-specific context factors are associated with workplace phobia. METHODS: A convenience sample of 288 primary care patients with chronic mental disorders (70% women) seen by 40 primary care clinicians in Germany were assessed using a standardized diagnostic interview about mental disorders and workplace problems. Workplace phobia was assessed by the Workplace Phobia Scale and a structured Diagnostic and Statical Manual of Mental Disorders-based diagnostic interview. In addition, capacity and participation restrictions, illness severity, and sick leave were assessed. RESULTS: Workplace phobia was found in 10% of patients with chronic mental disorders, that is, approximately about 3% of all general practice patients. Patients with workplace phobia had longer durations of sick leave than patients without workplace phobia and were impaired to a higher degree in work-relevant capacities. They also had a higher degree of restrictions in participation in other areas of life. CONCLUSIONS: Workplace phobia seems to be a frequent problem in primary care. It may behoove primary care clinicians to consider workplace-related anxiety, including phobia, particularly when patients ask for a work excuse for nonspecific somatic complaints.",2014,Jul-Aug,J Am Board Fam Med,27,4,486-94,25002003.0,10.3122/jabfm.2014.04.130308,,#1682,Muschalla 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"The developmental trajectories of racial and gender intergroup bias in 5- to 10-year-old children: The impact of general psychological tendencies, contextual factors, and individual propensities","Misch, A.; Dunham, Y.; Paulus, M.","Racism and intergroup discrimination are pervasive problems in human societies. Whereas several studies have shown that children show bias in the context of many kinds of groups, much less is known about how and when general psychological tendencies and contextual factors contribute to the manifestation of intergroup bias across development, and whether individual differences play a role. In the present study, we pursue these questions by investigating and comparing the developmental trajectories of intergroup bias in 5- to 10-year-old (mostly) White children (n = 100). We assessed children's liking and preferences towards 4 racial groups (White, East Asian, Black, and Middle Eastern) and towards 2 gender groups (male and female) in a within-subject design. We found that the young children in our sample showed a significant racial and gender ingroup bias, speaking to an early and strong manifestation of intergroup bias on the basic ingroup-outgroup distinction. This bias decreased with age. At the same time, we found considerable differences between the different types of outgroups from early on. Furthermore, there were remarkable differences between the developmental trajectories of gender and racial intergroup bias, highlighting the role of both social and contextual influences.

Cortical thickness and trait empathy in patients and people at high risk for alcohol use disorders,"Schmidt, T.; Roser, P.; Ze, O.; Juckel, G.; Suchan, B.; Thoma, P.","RATIONALE: Alcoholism not only affects individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) but also their biological relatives. This high-risk (HR) group has a higher probability to develop AUD. The aim of our study was to compare cortical thickness (CT) in AUD patients relative to participants with (HR) and without (non-HR) familial predisposition for AUD. We focused on empathy-related brain areas as sociocognitive impairment represents a known risk factor for AUD. METHOD: We examined 13 individuals with AUD, 14 HR individuals, and 20 non-HR participants using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (3 Tesla) to investigate differences in CT. CT was correlated with self-reported empathy in empathy-related areas. RESULTS: AUD patients showed decreased CT in the left inferior and superior frontal gyri, the right precuneus and bilaterally in the middle frontal gyri/the insula relative to the HR group, and in the left insula, the right middle frontal gyrus and bilaterally in the superior frontal gyrus/the precuneus relative to the non-HR group (all ps < 0.036, all n(p)(2) between 0.161 and 0.375). Reduced CT in inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri was related to cognitive (all ps < 0.036) and reduced CT in the inferior frontal gyrus to affective (p = 0.031) empathy.

The relationship between executive functioning and addictive behavior: new insights from a longitudinal community study,"Kraplin, A.; Joshanloo, M.; Wolff, M.; Kronke, K. M.; Goschke, T.; Buhringer, G.; Smolka, M. N.","RATIONALE: Although there is evidence that impaired executive functioning plays a role in addictive behavior, the longitudinal relationship between the two remains relatively unknown. OBJECTIVES: In a prospective-longitudinal community study, we tested the hypothesis that lower executive functioning is associated with more addictive behavior at one point in time and over time. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-eight individuals (19-27 years, 59% female) from a random community sample were recruited into three groups: addictive disorders related to substances (n = 100) or to behaviors (n = 118), or healthy controls (n = 120). At baseline, participants completed nine executive function tasks from which a latent variable of general executive functioning (GEF) was derived. Addictive behavior (i.e., quantity and frequency of use, and number of DSM-5 criteria met) were assessed using standardized clinical interviews at baseline and three annual follow-ups. The trajectories of addictive behaviors were examined using latent growth curve modeling. RESULTS: At baseline, we found weak to no evidence of an associations between GEF and addictive behavior. We found evidence for an association between a lower GEF at baseline and a higher increase in the quantity of use and a smaller decrease in frequency of use over time, but no evidence for an association with an increase in the number of DSM-5 criteria met. CONCLUSIONS: Lower EFs appear to lead to a continuing loss of control over use, whereas addictive disorders may develop secondarily after a long period of risky use.

Benefits of maternal education for mental health trajectories across childhood and adolescence,"Meyrose, A. K.; Klasen, F.; Otto, C.; Gniewosz, G.; Lampert, T.; Ravens-Sieberer, U.","RATIONALE: Mental health problems in children and adolescents are widespread and are a primary public health concern worldwide. During childhood and adolescence different challenges must be met. Whether the corresponding developmental tasks can be mastered successfully and in a psychologically healthy manner depends on the availability of resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to examine the benefits of maternal education on the development of mental health in children and adolescents. METHOD: Data from 2810 participants (48.7% female, 7- to 19-years old) of the longitudinal BELLA study (mental health module of the representative German KiGGS study) were analyzed from up to four measurement points (2003-2012). Individual growth modeling was employed to estimate the benefits of maternal education (Comparative Analysis of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations, CASMIN) for the trajectories of mental health problems (parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ) in children and adolescents. RESULTS: Children of mothers with low education had significantly more mental health problems compared to children of mothers with high education. This difference due to maternal education applied for girls as well as boys and especially for participants who did not live with both biological parents. Further, the difference in mental health problems due to varying maternal education decreased with increasing age of the participants.

"""Push it!"" or ""Hold it!""? A comparison of nicotine-avoidance training and nicotine-inhibition training in smokers motivated to quit","Machulska, A.; Rinck, M.; Klucken, T.; Kleinke, K.; Wunder, J. C.; Remeniuk, O.; Margraf, J.","RATIONALE: Recently, experimental paradigms have been developed to strengthen automatic avoidance or inhibitory responses for smoking cues. However, these procedures have not yet been directly compared regarding their effectiveness and mechanisms of action. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the effects of avoidance vs. inhibitory training as an add-on to a brief smoking cessation intervention. The standard Approach-Avoidance-Task (AAT) was adapted for both training types and control conditions. METHODS: One hundred twenty-four smokers attended behavioral counseling for smoking cessation and were thereafter randomized to one of four training conditions: avoidance-AAT, sham-avoidance-AAT, inhibition-AAT, sham-inhibition-AAT. During a 2-week training period including five training sessions, smokers in the avoidance-AAT trained to implicitly avoid all smoking-related cues, while smokers in the inhibition-AAT trained to implicitly inhibit behavioral response to smoking cues. During sham training, no such contingencies appeared. Self-report and behavioral data were assessed before and after training. Cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence were also assessed at 4- and 12-week follow-ups. RESULTS: At posttest, avoidance training was more effective in reducing daily smoking than inhibition training. However, this difference was no longer evident in follow-up assessments. All training conditions improved other smoking- and health-related outcomes. Neither training changed smoking-related approach biases or associations, but approach biases for smoking-unrelated pictures increased and Stroop interference decreased in all conditions. Smoking devaluation was also comparable in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance training might be slightly more effective in reducing smoking than inhibitory training. Overall, however, all four training types yielded equivalent therapy and training effects.

Effects of anxiety sensitivity and expectations on the modulation of the startle eyeblink response during a caffeine challenge,"Benke, C.; Blumenthal, T. D.; Modess, C.; Hamm, A. O.; Pane-Farre, C. A.","RATIONALE: The way in which the tendency to fear somatic arousal sensations (anxiety sensitivity), in interaction with the created expectations regarding arousal induction, might affect defensive responding to a symptom provocation challenge is not yet understood. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the effect of anxiety sensitivity on autonomic arousal, startle eyeblink responses, and reported arousal and alertness to expected vs. unexpected caffeine consumption. METHODS: To create a match/mismatch of expected and experienced arousal, high and low anxiety sensitive participants received caffeine vs. no drug either mixed in coffee (expectation of arousal induction) or in bitter lemon soda (no expectation of arousal induction) on four separate occasions. Autonomic arousal (heart rate, skin conductance level), respiration (end-tidal CO2, minute ventilation), defensive reflex responses (startle eyeblink), and reported arousal and alertness were recorded prior to, immediately and 30 min after beverage ingestion. RESULTS: Caffeine increased ventilation, autonomic arousal, and startle response magnitudes. Both groups showed comparable levels of autonomic and respiratory responses. The startle eyeblink responses were decreased when caffeine-induced arousal occurred unexpectedly, e.g., after administering caffeine in bitter lemon. This effect was more accentuated in high anxiety sensitive persons. Moreover, in high anxiety sensitive persons, the expectation of arousal (coffee consumption) led to higher subjective alertness when administering caffeine and increased arousal even if no drug was consumed.

RESULTS: High and low anxiety sensitive persons showed comparable autonomic arousal and symptom reports to caffeine which was modulated by expectation, i.e., greater for coffee. Respiratory responding (CO2 decrease, minute ventilation increase) was more accentuated when caffeine was both expected and administered in the low anxiety sensitive group but more accentuated when caffeine was unexpectedly administered in the high anxiety sensitive group.

Human olfactory lateralization requires trigeminal activation,"Croy, I.; Schulz, M.; Blumrich, A.; Hummel, C.; Gerber, J.; Hummel, T.","Rats are able to lateralize odors. This ability involves specialized neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex which are able to process the left, right and bilateral presentation of stimuli. However, it is not clear whether this function is preserved in humans. Humans are in general not able to differentiate whether a selective olfactory stimulant has been applied to the left or right nostril; however exceptions have been reported. Following a screening of 152 individuals with an olfactory lateralization test, we identified 19 who could lateralize odors above chance level. 15 of these ""lateralizers"" underwent olfactory fMRI scanning in a block design and were compared to 15 controls matched for age and sex distribution. As a result, both groups showed comparable activation of olfactory eloquent brain areas. However, subjects with lateralization ability had a significantly enhanced activation of cerebral trigeminal processing areas (somatosensory cortex, intraparietal sulcus). In contrast to controls, lateralizers furthermore exhibited no suppression in the area of the trigeminal principal sensory nucleus. An exploratory study with an olfactory change detection paradigm furthermore showed that lateralizers oriented faster towards changes in the olfactory environment. Taken together, our study suggests that the trigeminal system is activated to a higher degree by the odorous stimuli in the group of ""lateralizers"". We conclude that humans are not able to lateralize odors based on the olfactory input alone, but vary in the degree to which the trigeminal system is recruited.",2014,Sep,NeuroImage,98,,289-95,24825502.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.05.004,,#1691,Croy 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
From Abstract Symbols to Emotional (In-)Sights: An Eye Tracking Study on the Effects of Emotional Vignettes and Pictures,"Usee, F.; Jacobs, A. M.; Ludtke, J.","Reading is known to be a highly complex, emotion-inducing process, usually involving connected and cohesive sequences of sentences and paragraphs. However, most empirical results, especially from studies using eye tracking, are either restricted to simple linguistic materials (e.g., isolated words, single sentences) or disregard valence-driven effects. The present study addressed the need for ecologically valid stimuli by examining the emotion potential of and reading behavior in emotional vignettes, often used in applied psychological contexts and discourse comprehension. To allow for a cross-domain comparison in the area of emotion induction, negatively and positively valenced vignettes were constructed based on pre-selected emotional pictures from the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS; Marchewka et al., 2014). We collected ratings of perceived valence and arousal for both material groups and recorded eye movements of 42 participants during reading and picture viewing. Linear mixed-effects models were performed to analyze effects of valence (i.e., valence category, valence rating) and stimulus domain (i.e., textual, pictorial) on ratings of perceived valence and arousal, eye movements in reading, and eye movements in picture viewing. Results supported the success of our experimental manipulation: emotionally positive stimuli (i.e., vignettes, pictures) were perceived more positively and less arousing than emotionally negative ones. The cross-domain comparison indicated that vignettes are able to induce stronger valence effects than their pictorial counterparts, no differences between vignettes and pictures regarding effects on perceived arousal were found. Analyses of eye movements in reading replicated results from experiments using isolated words and sentences: perceived positive text valence attracted shorter reading times than perceived negative valence at both the supralexical and lexical level. In line with previous findings, no emotion effects on eye movements in picture viewing were found. This is the first eye tracking study reporting superior valence effects for vignettes compared to pictures and valence-specific effects on eye movements in reading at the supralexical level.",2020,2020/05/26,Front Psychol,11,,905,32528357.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00905,,#1692,Usee 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Effects of pre-encoding stress on brain correlates associated with the long-term memory for emotional scenes,"Wirkner, J.; Weymar, M.; Low, A.; Hamm, A.

In the present study we used the ERP old/new effect to investigate brain dynamics underlying the long-term effects of acute pre-encoding stress on memory for emotional and neutral scenes. Participants were exposed either to the Socially Evaluated Cold Pressure Test (SECPT) or a warm water control procedure before viewing 30 unpleasant, 30 neutral and 30 pleasant pictures. Two weeks after encoding, recognition memory was tested using 90 old and 90 new pictures. Emotional pictures were better recognized than neutral pictures in both groups and related to an enhanced centro-parietal ERP old/new difference (400-800 ms) during recognition, which suggests better recollection. Most interestingly, pre-encoding stress exposure specifically increased the ERP old/new-effect for emotional (unpleasant) pictures, but not for neutral pictures. These enhanced ERP/old new differences for emotional (unpleasant) scenes were particularly pronounced for those participants who reported high levels of stress during the SECPT.

These factors correlated with conflict processing in six experiments that utilized different conflict tasks (flanker, Simon) and different types of emotional stimuli (visual, auditory). Participants high in effortful control and low in anxiety and depression responded faster to conflict processing in emotional stimuli, showed an enhanced ERP conflict negativity, and additional activation in the ventral ACC.

We recorded accuracies, mean reaction times, and face-sensitive ERPs. Performance data revealed that shape caricaturing facilitated identity processing for unfamiliar faces only. In the ERP data, such effects of shape caricaturing emerged earlier than those of color caricaturing. Unsurprisingly, ERP effects were accentuated for larger levels of caricaturing.

Caricature generalization benefits for faces learned with enhanced idiosyncratic shape or texture,"Itz, M. L.; Schweinberger, S. R.; Kaufmann, J. M.","Recent findings show benefits for learning and subsequent recognition of faces caricatured in shape or texture, but there is little evidence on whether this caricature learning advantage generalizes to recognition of veridical counterparts at test. Moreover, it has been reported that there is a relatively higher contribution of texture information, at the expense of shape information, for familiar compared to unfamiliar face recognition. The aim of this study was to examine whether veridical faces are recognized better when they were learned as caricatures compared to when they were learned as veridicals-what we call a caricature generalization benefit. Photorealistic facial stimuli derived from a 3-D camera system were caricatured selectively in either shape or texture by 50 %. Faces were learned across different images either as veridicals, shape caricatures, or texture caricatures. At test, all learned and novel faces were presented as previously unseen frontal veridicals, and participants performed an old-new task. We assessed accuracies, reaction times, and face-sensitive event-related potentials (ERPs). Faces learned as caricatures were recognized more accurately than faces learned as veridicals.

Rumination but not distraction increases eating-related symptoms in anorexia and bulimia nervosa,"Naumann, E.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.; Voderholzer, U.; Caffier, D.; Svaldi, J.","Recent models of eating disorders emphasize the importance of ruminative thinking in the occurrence of unhealthy eating behavior. Hence, the aim of the current study was to examine the influence of induced rumination and distraction on the desire to engage in eating-related symptoms in anorexia (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). After a sadness induction, either a ruminative or distractive emotion regulation style was encouraged in women with AN (n = 38), BN (n = 37), and non-eating disordered controls (CG; n = 36). At baseline and after the emotion regulation induction feelings of sadness, desire to abstain from eating (DTA) and desire to binge (DTB) were assessed. Main results reveal that rumination led to a significant increase of DTA in the AN group and of DTB in patients with BN. In the CG, DTA significantly decreased after distraction. Although there were significant increases in subjective sadness in the rumination condition, no changes were found in the distraction condition. The results suggest that rumination in response to sadness has a detrimental effect on eating-related symptoms in eating disorders.",2015,May,J Abnorm Psychol,124,2,412-20,25730516.0,10.1037/abn0000046,,#1697,Naumann 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

"The Relationship of Acculturation, Traumatic Events and Depression in Female Refugees","Starck, A.; Gutermann, J.; Schouler-Ocak, M.; Jesuthasan, J.; Bongard, S.; Stangier, U.","Recent research has identified significant correlations between traumatic events and depression in refugees. However, few studies have addressed the role of acculturation strategies in this relationship. This study explored the relationship between cultural orientation, traumatic events and depression in female refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, and Somalia living in Germany. We expected acculturation strategies to moderate the effect of traumatic experiences on depression. The sample included 98 female refugees in Germany. The depression scale of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) represented the dependent measure. The trauma checklists derived from the Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) as well as the Frankfurt Acculturation Scale (FRACC) were used as independent measures for traumatic events and orientation toward the host culture as well as orientation toward the culture of origin, respectively. A moderation analysis was conducted to examine whether the relationship between the number of traumatic events and depression was influenced by the women's orientation toward the culture of origin and the host culture. We identified a significant model explaining 26.85% of the variance in depressive symptoms (Cohen's f(2) = 0.37). The number of traumatic events and the orientation toward the host culture exerted significant effects on depressive symptoms. The moderating effect was not significant, indicating that the effect of the number of traumatic events was not influenced by cultural orientation.

Avoidant decision making in social anxiety: the interaction of angry faces and emotional responses,"Pittig, A.; Pawlikowski, M.; Craske, M. G.; Alpers, G. W.","Recent research indicates that angry facial expressions are preferentially processed and may facilitate automatic avoidance response, especially in socially anxious individuals. However, few studies have examined whether this bias also expresses itself in more complex cognitive processes and behavior such as decision making. We recently introduced a variation of the Iowa Gambling Task which allowed us to document the influence of task-irrelevant emotional cues on rational decision making. The present study used a modified gambling task to investigate the impact of angry facial expressions on decision making in 38 individuals with a wide range of social anxiety. Participants were to find out which choices were (dis-) advantageous to maximize overall gain. To create a decision conflict between approach of reward and avoidance of fear-relevant angry faces, advantageous choices were associated with angry facial expressions, whereas disadvantageous choices were associated with happy facial expressions. Results indicated that higher social avoidance predicted less advantageous decisions in the beginning of the task, i.e., when contingencies were still uncertain. Interactions with specific skin conductance responses further clarified that this initial avoidance only occurred in combination with elevated responses before choosing an angry facial expressions. In addition, an interaction between high trait anxiety and elevated responses to early losses predicted faster learning of an advantageous strategy. These effects were independent of intelligence, general risky decision-making, self-reported state anxiety, and depression. Thus, socially avoidant individuals who respond emotionally to angry facial expressions are more likely to show avoidance of these faces under uncertainty. This novel laboratory paradigm may be an appropriate analog for central features of social anxiety.",2014,2014/09/29,Front Psychol,5,,1050,25324792.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01050,,#1700,Pittig 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

To this end, the present study investigated avoidant decisions in treatment-seeking individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). In a gambling task, advantageous choices to maximize gains were associated with task-irrelevant angry faces and disadvantageous choices with happy faces. The clinical relevance of avoidant decisions for in vivo anxiety in a social stress situation (public speaking) were examined (n = 44). In a subsample (n = 20), the predictive value for a reduction of avoidance following behavioral therapy was also evaluated. Results indicated a close link between more frequent avoidant decisions and elevated in vivo anxiety. Moreover, individuals who showed a deficit in the goal-directed adjustment of their decisions also showed higher and sustained distress during the social stressor and reported less decrease of avoidance following treatment. The findings highlight the importance of an avoidant decision-making style for the experience of acute distress and the maintenance of avoidance in SAD.

The Effects of a 3-Week Heartbeat Perception Training on Interoceptive Abilities,"Schillings, C.; Karanassios, G.; Schulte, N.; Schultchen, D.; Pollatos, O.","Recent studies showed promising short-term effects of heartbeat perception training on interoceptive abilities. Research on the effects of heartbeat perception training on interoceptive abilities over time is sparse. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the short-term effects and the effects of a 3-week heartbeat perception training over time on interoceptive abilities, namely, cardiac interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and interoceptive sensibility (IS). A total of 40 healthy participants were randomized to the intervention group (n = 20) or the control group (n = 20). The intervention group conducted three cardiac biofeedback sessions (one per week) at the laboratory, whereas the control group watched a documentary instead. Interoceptive abilities were assessed via the heartbeat perception task (IAc) and confidence ratings (IS) at baseline, after each laboratory session, and 1 week after the last session (post-measurement). IAc was significantly increased in the intervention group compared to the control group after the first training session (short-term effect). There were no significant improvements in IS due to the first session, and neither on IAc nor IS over time. Descriptive trends of improved interoceptive abilities over time were found in both groups. Single session of heartbeat perception training seems to be a promising approach to improve IAc.

It's worth the trouble: Stressor exposure is related to increased cognitive reappraisal ability,"Zeier, P.; Meine, L. E.; Wessa, M.","Recent theories propose moderate (compared to high or no) stressor exposure to promote emotion regulation capacities. More precisely, stressful situations are expected to serve as practice opportunities for cognitive reappraisal (CR), that is, the reinterpretation of a situation to alter its emotional impact. Accordingly, in this study, we expect an inverted U-shaped relationship between exposure to daily hassles and performance in a CR task, that is, best reappraisal ability in individuals with a history of moderate stressor exposure. Participants (N = 165) reported the number of daily hassles during the last week as indicator of stressor exposure and completed the Script-based Reappraisal Test (SRT). In the SRT, participants are presented with fear-eliciting scripts and instructed to either downregulate negative affect via reappraisal (reappraisal-trials) or react naturally (control-trials). Two measures indicate CR ability: (1) reappraisal effectiveness, that is, the difference between affective ratings in reappraisal- and control-trials and (2) reappraisal inventiveness, that is, the number of valid and categorically different reappraisal thoughts. Multiple regression analyses revealed positive linear, but not quadratic, relationships of exposure to daily hassles and both indicators of CR ability.

"Failure to Replicate the Association Between Fractional Anisotropy and the Serotonin Transporter Gene (5-HTTLPR, rs25531)","Klucken, T.; Tapia Leon, I.; Blecker, C.; Kruse, O.; Stalder, T.; Stark, R.","Recent work underlines the importance of alterations in white matter (e.g., measured by fractional anisotropy (FA)) as a neural vulnerability marker for psychiatric disorders. In this context, the uncinate fasciculus (UF), which connects the limbic system with prefrontal areas, has repeatedly been linked to psychiatric disorders, fear processing, and anxiety-related traits. Individual differences in FA may partly be genetically determined. Variation in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region [5-HTTLPR]) is a particularly promising candidate in this context, which has been linked to psychiatric disorders as well as to limbic and prefrontal reactivity. However, findings on the association between the 5-HTTLPR and FA within the UF-tract have been heterogeneous. The present study investigated this relationship and extended previous work by considering different genetic classification approaches as well as sex effects in a human sample (n = 114). All participants were genotyped for the 5-HTTLPR and the rs25531 polymorphism. As a main result, we did not find any significant relationship between the 5-HTTLPR and FA in the UF-tract although power analyses showed an adequate power. In addition, genotype effects were neither found when different classification approaches were used nor when analyses were carried out in males or females only. The present findings suggest that the association of the 5-HTTLPR and FA seems to be a more labile phenomenon than previously assumed.

Here, we set out to conceptually replicate and extend this finding with rigorous experimental control in a threat of shock paradigm. We induced two intensity levels of anxiety by presenting visual cues that indicated different strengths of electric stimuli. Each of the 59 participants went through one of two conditions that only differed in the order of moderate and high threat phases. As a manipulation check, orbicularis-EMG to auditory startle probes, electrodermal activity, and state anxiety confirmed the effects of the specific threat exposure. Critically, after some time had passed, participants for whom exposure had ended with high threat reported more anxiety for the entire episode than those for whom it ended with moderate threat. Moreover, they ranked their experience as more aversive when compared to other unpleasant everyday experiences. This study overcomes several previous limitations and speaks to the generalizability of the peak-end bias.

Toward a valid electrocortical correlate of regulation of craving using single-trial regression,"Dieterich, R.; Nickel, S.; Endrass, T.","Regulation of craving (ROC) is a promising method of intervention in addiction and has received attention in event-related potential (ERP) research investigating the late positive potential (LPP). However, in the face of previously unaligned behavioral and LPP results, the present work aimed to take a first step toward more valid electrocortical markers of ROC. Twenty-seven smokers (16 female), abstinent from smoking for 3 h prior to testing, viewed smoking-related pictures while EEG was recorded. During picture viewing, participants were asked to either imagine the short-term benefits (NOW condition) or long-term negative consequences (LATER condition) of smoking, or engage in an arithmetic task (DISTRACT condition). After each picture, participants indicated picture-related subjective craving. In addition to analyzing classic ERPs, we employed single-trial multiple robust regression within subjects to relate EEG activity at each time point and electrode to trial-wise craving ratings. Craving was lower in the LATER and DISTRACT than the NOW condition. LPP amplitudes (300-1000 ms at centro-parietal electrodes) were lower in the DISTRACT but not the LATER compared to the NOW condition. Trial-wise craving was captured between 500 and 1100 ms and around 2400 ms at central midline and left sites for DISTRACT and associated with a very brief and local signal (~900 ms; at C3) for LATER. This replicates the mismatch between self-reported craving and LPP.

The value of confidence: Confidence prediction errors drive value-based learning in the absence of external feedback,"Ptasczynski, L. E.; Steinecker, I.; Sterzer, P.; Guggenmos, M.","Reinforcement learning algorithms have a long-standing success story in explaining the dynamics of instrumental conditioning in humans and other species. While normative reinforcement learning models are critically dependent on external feedback, recent findings in the field of perceptual learning point to a crucial role of internally generated reinforcement signals based on subjective confidence, when external feedback is not available. Here, we investigated the existence of such confidence-based learning signals in a key domain of reinforcement-based learning: instrumental conditioning. We conducted a value-based decision making experiment which included phases with and without external feedback and in which participants reported their confidence in addition to choices. Behaviorally, we found signatures of self-reinforcement in phases without feedback, reflected in an increase of subjective confidence and choice consistency. To clarify the mechanistic role of confidence in value-based learning, we compared a family of confidence-based learning models with more standard models predicting either no change in value estimates or a devaluation over time when no external reward is provided. We found that confidence-based models indeed outperformed these reference models, whereby the learning signal of the winning model was based on the prediction error between current confidence and a stimulus-unspecific average of previous confidence levels. Interestingly, individuals with more volatile reward-based value updates in the presence of feedback also showed more volatile confidence-based value updates when feedback was not available. Together, our results provide evidence that confidence-based learning signals affect instrumentally learned subjective values in the absence of external feedback.",2022,Oct,PLoS Comput Biol,18,10,e1010580,36191055.0,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010580,,#1708,Ptasczynski 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Lasting effects of cognitive emotion regulation: neural correlates of reinterpretation and distancing,"Hermann, A.; Neudert, M. K.; Schafer, A.; Zehtner, R. I.; Fricke, S.; Seinsche, R.

Relatively less is known about their (differential) lasting effects on emotional responding and related neural correlates. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated 85 healthy females, participating in a 2-day cognitive emotion regulation experiment. On the first day, participants were instructed to passively look at, reinterpret or distance from repeatedly presented aversive pictures. One week later, they were re-exposed to the same stimuli without regulation instruction, in order to assess lasting effects. The main outcome measures comprised ratings of negative feelings and blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses. Lasting effects for reinterpretation compared with looking at aversive pictures during passive re-exposure 1 week later were reflected in stronger activation of the left amygdala, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and reduced negative feelings. Neither distancing compared with looking at aversive pictures nor reinterpretation compared with distancing did result in significant effects during re-exposure. These findings indicate that reinterpretation leads to reduced negative feelings 1 week later, which might be mediated by inhibitory vmPFC activation or stronger positive emotions during re-exposure.

"The differential relationship between trait anxiety, depression, and resting frontal alpha-asymmetry","Adolph, D.; Margraf, J.","Relatively larger resting right frontal cortical brain activation has been labeled as a risk factor for emotion-related disorders. In light of this framework, the present studies' aim was twofold. First, we wanted to determine whether a relationship between symptoms of anxiety and depression and frontal asymmetry does already manifest in a sample of so far healthy individuals showing a large symptom range. This could be expected if frontal asymmetry constitutes a risk factor for depression and anxiety. Second, we aimed to investigate whether symptoms of depression and anxiety are independently related to frontal asymmetry, or whether either anxiety or depression is superior in predicting the relationship with frontal asymmetry. To address these questions, trait-like resting frontal alpha-asymmetry by means of EEG, as well as trait anxiety and depressive symptoms by questionnaire were measured from 43 healthy students (28 female). Results indicate that higher symptom severity of depression and anxiety were both significantly correlated with relatively larger right frontal cortical activation. However, in a regression analysis, frontal asymmetry was predicted by anxiety only. Controlling for depression and mood, anxiety explained 13% of variance, while controlling for mood and anxiety, depression did explain <1% of variance within frontal asymmetry. In conclusion, although both anxiety and depression add to the relationship, relatively larger right frontal cortical activity might be influenced more strongly by symptoms of anxiety. Moreover, as this effect is present already in healthy individuals, the findings might further support the notion that right frontal cortical asymmetry constitutes a risk factor for anxiety or depression.",2017,Mar,J Neural Transm (Vienna),124,3,379-386,27987054.0,10.1007/s00702-016-1664-9,,#1710,Adolph 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Informing About the Nocebo Effect Affects Patients' Need for Information About Antidepressants-An Experimental Online Study,"Nestoriuc, Y.; Pan, Y.; Kinitz, T.; Weik, E.; Shedden-Mora, M. C.","Relevance: Understanding patients' informational needs and adapting drug-related information are the prerequisites for a contextualized informed consent. Current information practices might rather harm by inducing nocebo effects. Objective: To investigate whether informing about the nocebo effect using a short information sheet affects patients' need for information about antidepressants. Methods: A total of 97 patients taking recently prescribed antidepressants (</=4 months intake) were recruited over the internet and randomized to receiving either a one-page written information about the nocebo effect or a control text about the history of antidepressants. After experimental manipulation, informational needs about the side effects and mechanisms of antidepressants were assessed with 3 and 7 items on categorical and 5-point Likert scales. Group differences in informational needs were calculated with Chi-square tests and ANOVAs. Results: Patients received antidepressants for depression (84.5%) and/or anxiety disorders (42.3%). Three participants (6.0%) of the nocebo group reported previous knowledge of the nocebo effect. After the experimental manipulation, participants in the nocebo group reported a reduced desire for receiving full side effect information [ X(4,97)2 = 12.714, Cramer's V = 0.362, p = 0.013] and agreed more frequently to the usefulness of withholding information about possible side effects [ X(4,97)2 = 14.878, Cramer's V = 0.392, p = 0.005]. Furthermore, they desired more information about the mechanisms of antidepressants (F = 6.373, p = 0.013, partial eta(2) = 0.063) and, specifically, non-pharmacological mechanisms, such as the role of positive expectations (F = 16.857, p < 0.001, partial eta(2) = 0.151). Conclusions: Learning about the nocebo effect can alter patients' informational needs toward desiring less information about the potential side effects of antidepressants and more information about general mechanisms, such as expectations.

D.; Pedersen, A.; Born, J.; Bartsch, T.","Replay of hippocampal neural representations during sleep is thought to promote systems consolidation of declarative memory. How this reprocessing of memory during sleep affects the hippocampal representation itself, is unclear. Here we tested hippocampal stimulus processing (i.e., pattern separation) before and after periods of sleep and wakefulness in humans (female and male participants). Pattern separation deteriorated across the wake period but remained stable across sleep (p = 0.013) with this sleep-wake difference being most pronounced for stimuli with low similarity to targets (p = 0.006). Stimuli with the highest similarity showed a reversed pattern with reduced pattern separation performance after sleep (p = 0.038). Pattern separation performance was positively correlated with sleep spindle density, slow oscillation density, and theta power phase-locked to slow oscillations. Sleep, presumably by neural memory replay, shapes hippocampal representations and enhances computations of pattern separation to subsequent presentation of similar stimuli.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories is causally related to reactivation during sleep of previously encoded representations. Here, we show that reactivation-based consolidation processes during sleep shape the hippocampal representation itself. We studied the effect of sleep and wakefulness on pattern separation (i.e., orthogonalization of similar representations) and completion performance (i.e., recall of a memory in light of noisy input) that are essential cognitive elements of encoding and retrieval of information by the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that pattern separation was stabilized after sleep but diminished after wakefulness. We further showed that pattern separation was related to EEG oscillatory parameters of non-REM sleep serving as markers of sleep-dependent memory consolidation and hippocampal reactivation.",2017,Dec 13,J Neurosci,37,50,12238-12246,29118106.0,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1189-17.2017,,#1716,Hanert 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Decrease of well-being and increase of online media use: Cohort trends in German university freshmen between 2016 and 2019,"Brailovskaia, J.; Margraf, J.","Research from the U.S. described a decrease of subjective well-being and an increase of online media use in young adults today. The present study investigated whether similar trends occur in Germany. Data of overall 1985 university freshmen (four cohorts: 2016: N=658, 2017: N=333, 2018: N=562, 2019: N=432) were collected by online surveys in the years 2016 to 2019. The comparison of the four cohorts revealed a significant increase of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, as well as of the use of social platforms from 2016 to 2019. In contrast, positive mental health (PMH) significantly decreased over the years. No significant changes of the gaming behavior were found. A slight significant positive relationship occurred between the negative variables of well-being and online media use. The association between PMH and online media use was significantly negative. Thus, cohort trends found in the U.S. can at least rudimentarily be replicated in Germany.

Measuring fluctuations in paranoia: Validity and psychometric properties of brief state versions of the Paranoia Checklist,"Schlier, B.; Moritz, S.; Lincoln, T. M.","Research increasingly assesses momentary changes in paranoia in order to elucidate causal mechanisms. Observed or manipulated changes in postulated causal factors should result in fluctuations in state paranoid ideation. Previous studies often employed a state-adapted Paranoia Checklist (Freeman et al., 2005) to measure state paranoia. This study examined whether the Paranoia Checklist or subsets of its items are appropriate for this purpose. Thirteen studies (N=860) were subjected to meta-analyses of each Paranoia Checklist item. We selected items based on (1) whether they showed pre-to-post change in the expected direction and (2) whether this effect was larger in experimental vs. control conditions. All resulting item selections were cross-validated on a hold-out sample (n=1893). Finally, we explored how much variation in paranoia was captured by the state-adapted version in a brief ambulatory assessment study (N=32). A thirteen item State Paranoia Checklist as well as a five item and a three item Brief State Paranoia Checklist were extracted. Cross validation revealed better model fit and increased sensitivity to change. Multilevel analysis indicated 25-30% of the variance in the Brief State Paranoia Checklists to be due to intra-individual daily fluctuations in paranoia. Our analyses produced reliable and valid revised scales. Increases in change sensitivity indicate that future assessment of state paranoia in experimental and ambulatory assessment studies can be optimized by using the revised scales.",2016,Jul 30,Psychiatry Res,241,,323-32,27227702.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2016.05.002,,#1720,Schlier 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Take my advice: Physiological measures reveal that intrinsic emotion regulation is more effective under external guidance,"Ngombe, N.; Kessler, K.; Shaw, D. J.","Research into emotion regulation (ER) has focused primarily on the intra-personal process through which we regulate our own emotions intrinsically. More recently, however, studies have begun to explore the inter-personal nature of intrinsic ER - that is, how we regulate our emotions under the guidance of others. Preliminary evidence suggests that ER might be more effective when implemented in an inter- compared with an intra-personal manner, but these findings are based almost exclusively on self-reported ratings that capture only the subjective experience of emotions. The current study therefore investigated whether this apparent superiority of inter-personal intrinsic ER could be replicated and extended to physiological measures of affective reactions - namely, various metrics of electrodermal activity. In a within-subjects design, a sufficiently powered sample (N = 146) were required to down-regulate their emotional reactions to negatively valenced images using an ER strategy they had chosen themselves intra-personally or one that had been recommended to them inter-personally. Physiological responses converged to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of inter- over intra-personal ER in decreasing negative affective reactions, despite subjective ratings suggesting that participants perceived the opposite to be true. The superiority of inter- over intra-personal ER in physiological recordings was unrelated to individuals' perceptions of their ability to regulate their own emotions, however, and so it remains to be seen if and how such benefits extend to clinical populations.",2022,Oct,Int J Psychophysiol,180,,49-59,35914547.0,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2022.07.008,,#1721,Ngombe 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

At T1, the clinical group reported lower bonding and higher parenting stress. Bonding was found to partially mediate the link between maternal diagnosis and parenting stress. Furthermore, the clinical group reported lower bonding and higher parenting stress averaged over both measurement times. However, at T2, the clinical group still differed from the controls even though they improved in bonding and reported less parenting stress.

Activity and subsequent depression levels: a causal analysis of behavioural activation group treatment with weekly assessments over 8 weeks,"Hoyer, J.; Hoefler, M.; Wuellhorst, V.","Research on behavioural activation (BA) for depression assumes that increasing the rate of rewarding activities leads to reduced depressive mood. Although the efficacy of BA treatment has been convincingly demonstrated, assumptions referring to the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been tested decisively yet. The Behavioural Activation Scale for Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory II were administered over 8 weeks in 161 reliably diagnosed patients with unipolar depression who underwent BA treatment in groups. Time-lagged associations between behavioural activity on depression at subsequent assessment (1 week later) and vice versa were modelled (a) with multilevel models and (b) dynamic panel models that eliminate shared constant factors and allow for reverse causation (e.g., depression affecting subsequent activation in the model for activation on depression). Both activation and depression changed significantly (model-based within effect sizes for activation = .70 and for depression = -.75). Higher activation and lower depression predict each other over time (mixed-effects, time-lagged model), but this association disappears in dynamic causal models. Change patterns were only analysed within a time frame of 1 week; smaller time intervals were not investigated. There were no objective observational data of activity patterns. In the present study, increased behavioural activity and reduced depressive mood co-occur on the week scale.

"Differential Effects of Attention-, Compassion-, and Socio-Cognitively Based Mental Practices on Self-Reports of Mindfulness and Compassion","Hildebrandt, L. K.; McCall, C.; Singer, T.","Research on the effects of mindfulness- and compassion-based interventions is flourishing along with self-report scales to assess facets of these broad concepts. However, debates remain as to which mental practices are most appropriate to develop the attentional, cognitive, and socio-affective facets of mindfulness and compassion. One crucial question is whether present-moment, attention-focused mindfulness practices are sufficient to induce a cascade of changes across the different proposed facets of mindfulness, including nonjudgmental acceptance, as well as compassion or whether explicit socio-affective training is required. Here, we address these questions in the context of a 9-month longitudinal study (the ReSource Project) by examining the differential effects of three different 3-month mental training modules on subscales of mindfulness and compassion questionnaires. The ""Presence"" module, which aimed at cultivating present-moment-focused attention and body awareness, led to increases in the observing, nonreacting, and presence subscales, but not to increases in acceptance or nonjudging. These latter facets benefitted from specific cultivation through the socio-cognitive ""Perspective"" module and socio-affective, compassion-based ""Affect"" module, respectively. These modules also led to further increases in scores on the subscales affected by the Presence module. Moreover, scores on the compassion scales were uniquely influenced by the Affect module. Thus, whereas a present-moment attention-focused training, as implemented in many mindfulness-based programs, was indeed able to increase attentional facets of mindfulness, only socio-cognitive and compassion-based practices led to broad changes in ethical-motivational qualities like a nonjudgmental attitude, compassion, and self-compassion.",2017,2017/04/06,Mindfulness (N Y),8,6,1488-1512,29201246.0,10.1007/s12671-017-0716-z,,#1724,Hildebrandt 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Infant distress to novelty is associated with maternal anxiety disorder and especially with maternal avoidance behavior,"Reck, C.; Muller, M.; Tietz, A.; Mohler, E.","Research suggested that maternal anxiety disorders might be related to infants' behavioral inhibition. This study investigated whether maternal postpartum anxiety disorder is associated with infant temperament, more precisely, infant distress to novelty, an early predictor of behavioral inhibition. Differences in the latter were analyzed in a German sample by comparing n = 38 healthy mother-infant dyads to n=44 dyads comprised of mothers diagnosed with a DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Infant age ranged from 2.83 to 7.97 months. Infant temperament was measured by means of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Mothers were screened for postpartum anxiety disorder using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders. Severity of anxiety was measured by self-reported questionnaires (Anxiety Cognition Questionnaire, Body Sensations Questionnaire and Mobility Inventory). Infant salivary cortisol reaction when being confronted with a socio-emotional stressor (Face-to-Face-Still-Face paradigm) was assessed to validate infant distress. A Mann-Whitney-U analysis suggested that infants of mothers with an anxiety disorder show more distress to novelty than infants of healthy mothers. Furthermore, data reveal a positive Spearman's rho-correlation between infant distress to novelty and maternal avoidance behavior (Mobility Inventory). A strong correlation between infant cortisol reactivity and reported distress to novelty validated the maternal evaluation of infant temperament in our sample.

Factors contributing to symptom change in standardized and individualized Internet-based interventions for depression: A randomized-controlled trial,"Zagorscak, P.; Heinrich, M.; Schulze, J.; Bottcher, J.; Knaevelsrud, C.","Research suggests 4 categories of outcome predictors in face-to-face therapy (i.e., treatment expectations, extratherapeutic factors, relationship factors, and factors specific to a treatment approach/technique). However, it is unclear whether these factors are relevant in standardized and individualized Internet-based interventions. To investigate this question, a secondary analysis of data from 1,089 mildly to moderately depressed adults undergoing 6 weeks of cognitive-behavioral Internet-based intervention for depression randomized to receive either weekly written feedback individualized by a counselor or automated and fully standardized feedback was performed. The following variables corresponding to the 4 categories were tested regarding associations with depressive symptom change during multiple treatment periods within a multigroup structural equation model: (a) outcome expectations, (b) extratherapeutic stressors and stress change during treatment, (c) midtreatment working alliance (task/goal and bond), and (d) uptake of treatment-specific components (logins and specific tool use). Results suggest similar regressive associations across treatment conditions: Previous symptom change was the most important predictor for subsequent symptom developments. Stress at baseline and the uptake of specific treatment components only played a minor role, and stronger task/goal ratings were associated with later symptom improvements. Early symptom improvements predicted stronger midtreatment task/goal and bond ratings, whereas only stronger task/goal ratings were associated with later symptom improvements. Outcome expectations were only indirectly related with symptom change mediated through goal/task ratings.

"An experience sampling study on the nature of the interaction between traumatic experiences, negative affect in everyday life, and threat beliefs","Krkovic, K.; Schlier, B.; Lincoln, T.","Research suggests that trauma is associated with the development of psychotic experiences, such as paranoia, via affective processes. However, the empirical evidence on the exact mechanism is limited and it is unclear which aspects of trauma are relevant. Here we tested whether self-reported frequency of trauma, recurring trauma, age, and type of trauma are predictive of later threat beliefs in daily life and which role affective processes (self-reported negative affect and autonomic arousal) play in this association. We tested two often postulated mechanisms: mediation, with affective processes in everyday life explaining the association between trauma and threat beliefs; and moderation, with trauma strengthening the association between affective processes and threat beliefs in everyday life. Trauma was assessed at baseline with the Trauma-History-Questionnaire in 67 individuals with attenuated symptoms of psychosis. We then applied the experience-sampling-method during 24 h to assess negative affect, heart rate and threat beliefs. Multilevel analysis showed that negative affect (p < 0.001) and heart rate (p < 0.05) were predictive of subsequent threat beliefs. There was no significant mediation effect from any trauma characteristic to threat beliefs via negative affect and heart rate. Trauma frequency (p < 0.001), age at first trauma (p < 0.001), as well as the presence of physical trauma (p < 0.001) moderated the path from negative affect to subsequent threat beliefs.

Me and you in a mobile world: The development of regional identity and personal relationships in young adulthood,"Borschel, E.; Zimmermann, J.; Crocetti, E.; Meeus, W.; Noack, P.; Neyer, F.

Placing the self in geographical space has now become a major challenge for young adults, making region a key identity domain. Little is known, however, about the correlates of regional identity development. In line with the dynamic-transactional paradigm, we expected longitudinal associations between regional identity and the geographical dispersion of personal relationships. We specifically assumed that both individual experiences-such as moving-and personal relationship experiences-such as emotional closeness toward relationship partners-moderate these associations over time. Using longitudinal multilevel analyses, we found support for these hypotheses in a 3-wave longitudinal study over 1 year with 1,059 postsecondary graduates from Germany (73% female, mean age 24.53 years). Most notably, changes in regional identity were related to changes in geographical distance from personal relationship partners. Effects were robust and confirmed when controlling for diverse reasons for moving. We conclude that regional identity and personal relationships share a common developmental pathway. This pathway also points toward the relevance of geographical distance from personal relationships, even in young adults' mobile and connected world.

Here, we used network analysis to examine the interrelations between ten RFs in 14-year-old adolescents exposed ('CA'; n = 638) and not exposed to CA ('no-CA'; n = 501). We found that the degree to which RFs are assumed to enhance each other is higher in the no-CA compared to the CA group. Upon correction for general distress levels, the global RF connectivity also differed between the two groups. More specifically, in the no-CA network almost all RFs were positively interrelated and thus may enhance each other, whereas in the CA network some RFs were negatively interrelated and thus may hamper each other. Moreover, the CA group showed more direct connections between the RFs and current distress. Therefore, CA seems to influence how RFs relate to each other and to current distress, potentially leading to a dysfunctional RF system.

Dynamics of defensive response mobilization during repeated terminations of exposure to increasing interoceptive threat,"Benke, C.; Krause, E.; Hamm, A. O.; Pane-Farre, C. A.","Resistant avoidance behaviors play a crucial role in the maintenance of anxiety disorders and are therefore central targets of therapeutic interventions. In the present study, the development of avoidance behavior was investigated in 24 healthy participants who repeatedly prematurely terminated the exposure to increasing interoceptive threat, i.e., the feeling of dyspnea induced by increasing inspiratory resistive loads that were followed by the ultimate threat, a short breathing occlusion. Physiological responses and subjective anxiety preceding terminations were compared to matched intervals of a matched control group (N=24) who completed the exposure. Initially, participants terminated during the ultimate threat, i.e., during occlusion. This first termination was preceded by a strong surge in autonomic arousal and reported anxiety. Startle reflex and the P3 component of event-related brain potentials to startle probes were strongly inhibited, indicating preparation for defensive action. With repetitive terminations, individuals successively terminated earlier, avoiding exposure to the occlusion. This avoidant behavior was accompanied by alleviated autonomic arousal as compared to the first termination. In addition, no indication of physiological response preparation was found implying that the avoidance behavior was performed in a rather habitual way. Matched controls did not show any indication of a defensive response surge in the matched intervals. In matched controls, no changes in physiological response patterns were detected while anxiety levels increased with repetitions.

No Modulatory Effects when Stimulating the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus with Continuous 6 Hz tACS and tRNS on Response Inhibition: A Behavioral Study,"Brauer, H.; Kadish, N. E.; Pedersen, A.; Siniatchkin, M.; Moliadze, V.","Response inhibition is the cognitive process required to cancel an intended action. During that process, a ""go"" reaction is intercepted particularly by the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA). After the commission of inhibition errors, theta activity (4-8 Hz) is related to the adaption processes. In this study, we intend to examine whether the boosting of theta activity by electrical stimulation over rIFG reduces the number of errors and the reaction times in a response inhibition task (Go/NoGo paradigm) during and after stimulation. 23 healthy right-handed adults participated in the study. In three separate sessions, theta tACS at 6 Hz, transcranial random noise (tRNS) as a second stimulation condition, and sham stimulation were applied for 20 minutes. Based on behavioral data, this study could not show any effects of 6 Hz tACS as well as full spectrum tRNS on response inhibition in any of the conditions. Since many findings support the relevance of the rIFG for response inhibition, this could mean that 6 Hz activity is not important for response inhibition in that structure. Reasons for our null findings could also lie in the stimulation parameters, such as the electrode montage or the stimulation frequency, which are discussed in this article in more detail.

Confirmatory factor analyses showed an inadequate fit for a one-factor solution and an acceptable fit for a two-factor model that distinguished by item-wording direction. To test whether the two factors represent substantively different dimensions of the construct or rather a statistical item-wording effect, two subscales were formed based on item-wording direction. As the subscales were not differentially associated with external measures, the one-factor solution may be considered appropriate. The scale showed good to excellent internal consistency values over time and across samples, had low retest reliability indices, and indicated construct validity based on moderate to high associations with cognitive and disease-related variables. The results further demonstrated the scale's sensitivity to change. The RTW-SE baseline score predicted physical performance and pain-related psychological impairment after orthopedic rehabilitation. In multiple regression analysis, RTW-SE remained a significant predictor of pain-related psychological impairment but not physical performance, partially demonstrating the predictive validity of the scale. The German version of the RTW-SE scale demonstrated satisfactory results regarding its validity and reliability.",2022,Aug 15,Int J Environ Res Public Health,19,16,10093,36011726.0,10.3390/ijerph191610093,,#1738,Hansmann 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Same fear responses, less avoidance: Rewards competing with aversive outcomes do not buffer fear acquisition, but attenuate avoidance to accelerate subsequent fear extinction","Pittig, A.; Dehler, J.","Rewards for approaching a feared stimulus may compete with fear reduction inherent to avoidance and thereby alter fear and avoidance learning. However, the impact of such competing rewards on fear and avoidance acquisition has rarely been investigated. During acquisition, participants chose between one option (CS+ option) associated with a neutral stimulus followed by an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) and another option (CS- option) associated with another neutral stimulus followed by no US (N = 223 randomized into three groups). In a subsequent test, no more USs occurred. In one group, competing rewards were established by linking the CS+ option to high rewards and the CS- option to low rewards during acquisition and test (Reward Group). In a second group, rewards were present during acquisition, but discontinued during test (Initial-Reward Group). In a third group, rewards were completely absent (No-Reward Group). Without competing rewards, significant avoidance was acquired and persisted in the absence of the US. Competing rewards attenuated avoidance acquisition already after the first experience of the aversive US. Avoidance remained attenuated even when rewards were discontinued during test. Rewards did, however, not change the level of fear responses to the CS+ (US expectancy, skin conductance). Finally, rewards did not change the level of fear reduction during test, which was, however, experienced earlier. Summarized, rewards for approaching aversive events do not buffer fear acquisition, but can prevent avoidance. This damping of avoidance may initiate fear extinction.",2019,Jan,Behav Res Ther,112,,1-11,30448689.0,10.1016/j.brat.2018.11.003,,#1739,Pittig 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Rumination in anorexia nervosa: Cognitive-affective and neuroendocrinological aspects,"Furtjes, S.; Seidel, M.; King, J. A.; Biemann, R.; Roessner, V.; Ehrlich, S.","Rumination about body weight/figure as well as food is common in patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and may be a maintenance factor of the disorder. While rumination can generally be considered as a cognitive-affective process, food-related rumination may be driven primarily by a physiological response to undernutrition. In the current longitudinal study, we integrate ecological momentary assessment of rumination and affect and, as a biological marker of undernutrition, plasma leptin levels collected from 33 AN patients. At the very acute stage and again after short-term weight-restoration patients answered short questionnaires six times per day over two weeks. Analyses via hierarchical linear modelling confirmed that rumination is closely linked to affect in AN before and after weight-restoration. Rumination about food decreased during weight-restoration and was correlated with leptin levels. In contrast, rumination about body weight/figure was not linked to leptin, persisted after weight gain, and showed stronger connections with affect. This suggests that rumination about body weight/figure seems to be a cognitive-affective aspect of the disorder, but food-related rumination may need to be considered from a physiological perspective. It is possible that food-related ruminative thoughts reflect a physiological symptom induced by undernutrition, similar to well-described leptin-associated changes in physical activity.",2018,Dec,Behav Res Ther,111,,92-98,30396110.0,10.1016/j.brat.2018.10.001,,#1740,Furtjes 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Rumination, Entrapment and Suicide Ideation: A Mediational Model","Teismann, T.; Forkmann, T.","Rumination has been shown to be positively associated with suicide ideation. Yet, only few studies have attempted to explain potential mediators of this association. Perceptions of entrapment are a core component of recent psychological models of suicidality and might mediate the relationship between rumination and suicide ideation. Possible mediator effects were investigated in an online sample (n = 142) and a clinical sample (n = 226) of adults receiving outpatient psychotherapy. Results demonstrated that perceptions of entrapment fully mediated the association between ruminative thinking and suicide ideation. However, the reverse relationship, where the association between entrapment and suicide ideation is mediated by ruminative thinking, was not supported. These findings suggest that the relationship between rumination and suicide ideation is explained by perceptions of entrapment. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

These impairments have been shown to go along with altered activation of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). However, studies that investigate connectivity of pSTS during social cognition in schizophrenia are sparse. Twenty-two patients with schizophrenia and 22 matched healthy controls completed a social-cognitive task for functional magnetic resonance imaging that allows the investigation of affective Theory of Mind (ToM), emotion recognition and the processing of neutral facial expressions. Moreover, a resting-state measurement was taken. Patients with schizophrenia performed worse in the social-cognitive task (main effect of group). In addition, a group by social-cognitive processing interaction was revealed for activity, as well as for connectivity during the social-cognitive task, i.e., patients with schizophrenia showed hyperactivity of right pSTS during neutral face processing, but hypoactivity during emotion recognition and affective ToM. In addition, hypoconnectivity between right and left pSTS was revealed for affective ToM, but not for neutral face processing or emotion recognition. No group differences in connectivity from right to left pSTS occurred during resting state.

Distinct structural alterations independently contributing to working memory deficits and symptomatology in paranoid schizophrenia,"Zierhut, K. C.; Schulte-Kemna, A.; Kaufmann, J.; Steiner, J.; Bogerts, B.; Schiltz, K.","Schizophrenia is considered a brain disease with a quite heterogeneous clinical presentation. Studies in schizophrenia have yielded a wide array of correlations between structural and functional brain changes and clinical and cognitive symptoms. Reductions of grey matter volume (GMV) in the prefrontal and temporal cortex have been described which are crucial for the development of positive and negative symptoms and impaired working memory (WM). Associations between GMV reduction and positive and negative symptoms as well as WM impairment were assessed in schizophrenia patients (symptomatology in 34, WM in 26) and compared to healthy controls (36 total, WM in 26). GMV was determined by voxel-based morphometry and its relation to positive and negative symptoms as well as WM performance was assessed. In schizophrenia patients, reductions of GMV were evident in anterior cingulate cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), superior temporal cortex, and insula. GMV reductions in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) were associated with positive symptom severity as well as WM impairment. Furthermore, the absolute GMV of VLPFC was strongly related to negative symptoms. These predicted WM performance as well as processing speed. The present results support the assumption of two distinct pathomechanisms responsible for impaired WM in schizophrenia: (1) GMV reductions in the VLPFC predict the severity of negative symptoms. Increased negative symptoms in turn are associated with a slowing down of processing speed and predict an impaired WM. (2) GMV reductions in the temporal and mediofrontal cortex are involved in the development of positive symptoms and impair WM performance, too.",2013,Apr,Cortex,49,4,1063-72,23040316.0,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.08.027,,#1744,Zierhut 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

However, previous studies have primarily focused on peer victimization, leaving a significant knowledge gap regarding violence by teachers. We hypothesized that, when almost all children experience violence by teachers, not only the experience of violence, but also other factors, for example, mental health problems, may influence children's social preference and centrality. We therefore examined potential moderation effects of children's internalizing and externalizing problems. We implemented a multistage cluster randomized sampling approach to randomly chose fifth- and sixth-grade students from primary schools throughout Tanzania. Using a multi-informant approach, data were collected from 643 children (51.0% girls, M(age) = 12.79 years). Results showed inconsistent direct associations between teacher violence and social status, whereas mental health problems were consistently associated with lower social status. Significant interaction effects were found for internalizing problems; that is, teacher violence was associated with lower social status for increasing internalizing problems. However, no interaction effects were found for externalizing problems. The findings underline the burden of exposure to violence by teachers and the importance of mental health for children's social functioning.

The thalamus provides an effective filter of central sensory information processing. As olfactory projections, however, largely bypass the thalamus, other filter mechanisms must consequently have evolved for the sense of smell. We investigated whether specific anosmia - the inability to perceive a specific odor whereas detection of other substances is unaffected - represents an effective peripheral filter of olfactory information processing. In contrast to previous studies, we showed in a sample of 1600 normosmic subjects, that specific anosmia is by no means a rare phenomenon. Instead, while the affected odor is highly individual, the general probability of occurrence of specific anosmia is close to 1. In addition, 25 subjects performed daily olfactory training sessions with enhanced exposure to their particular ""missing"" smells for the duration of three months. This resulted in a significant improvement of sensitivity towards the respective specific odors. We propose specific anosmia to occur as a rule, rather than an exception, in the sense of smell.

Increased perceived self-efficacy facilitates the extinction of fear in healthy participants,"Zlomuzica, A.; Preusser, F.; Schneider, S.; Margraf, J.","Self-efficacy has been proposed as an important element of a successful cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT). Positive changes in perceived self-efficacy have been linked to an improved adaptive emotional and behavioral responding in the context of anxiety-provoking situations. Furthermore, a positive influence of increased self-efficacy on cognitive functions has been confirmed. The present study examined the effect of verbal persuasion on perceived self-efficacy and fear extinction. Healthy participants were subjected to a standardized differential fear conditioning paradigm. After fear acquisition, half of the participants received a verbal persuasion aimed at increasing perceived self-efficacy. The extinction of fear was assessed immediately thereafter on both the implicit and explicit level. Our results suggest that an increased perceived self-efficacy was associated with enhanced extinction, evidenced on the psychophysiological level and accompanied by more pronounced decrements in conditioned negative valence. Changes in extinction were not due to a decrease in overall emotional reactivity to conditioned stimuli (CS). In addition, debriefing participants about the false positive feedback did not affect the processing of already extinguished conditioned responses during a subsequent continued extinction phase.

"Me, myself, and I: self-referent word use as an indicator of self-focused attention in relation to depression and anxiety","Brockmeyer, T.; Zimmermann, J.; Kulessa, D.; Hautzinger, M.; Bents, H.; Friederich, H. C.; Herzog, W.; Backenstrass, M.","Self-focused attention (SFA) is considered a cognitive bias that is closely related to depression. However, it is not yet well understood whether it represents a disorder-specific or a trans-diagnostic phenomenon and which role the valence of a given context is playing in this regard. Computerized quantitative text-analysis offers an integrative psycho-linguistic approach that may help to provide new insights into these complex relationships. The relative frequency of first-person singular pronouns in natural language is regarded as an objective, linguistic marker of SFA. Here we present two studies that examined the associations between SFA and symptoms of depression and anxiety in two different contexts (positive vs. negative valence), as well as the convergence between pronoun-use and self-reported aspects of SFA. In the first study, we found that the use of first-person singular pronouns during negative but not during positive memory recall was positively related to symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with anorexia nervosa with varying levels of co-morbid depression and anxiety. In the second study, we found the same pattern of results in non-depressed individuals. In addition, use of first-person singular pronouns during negative memory recall was positively related to brooding (i.e., the assumed maladaptive sub-component of rumination) but not to reflection. These findings could not be replicated in two samples of depressed patients. However, non-chronically depressed patients used more first-person singular pronouns than healthy controls, irrespective of context. Taken together, the findings lend partial support to theoretical models that emphasize the effects of context on self-focus and consider SFA as a relevant trans-diagnostic phenomenon.

Self-Distancing as a Strategy to Regulate Affect and Aggressive Behavior in Athletes: An Experimental Approach to Explore Emotion Regulation in the Laboratory,"Michel-Krohler, A.; Kaurin, A.; Heil, L. F.; Berti, S.","Self-regulation, especially the regulation of emotion, is an important component of athletic performance. In our study, we tested the effect of a self-distancing strategy on athletes' performance in an aggression-inducing experimental task in the laboratory. To this end, we modified an established paradigm of interpersonal provocation [Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP)], which has the potential to complement field studies in order to increase our understanding of effective emotion regulation of athletes in critical situations in competitions. In our experimental setting, we first tested the applicability of the self-distancing perspective and the athletes' ability to dynamically adapt besides the self-distanced perspective a self-immersed perspective to provocation in the TAP. Secondly, we investigated how this altered perspective modulated regulatory abilities of negative affectivity, anger, and aggression. The experiment consisted of two conditions in which the participant adopted either a self-immersed or a self-distanced perspective. Forty athletes (female: 23; male: 17) from different team (n = 27) and individual sports (n = 13) with a mean age of 23.83 years (SD = 3.41) competed individually in a reaction-time task against a (fictitious) opponent. Results show that athletes are equally able to adopt both perspectives. In addition, within-person analyses indicate that self-distancing decreased aggressive behavior and negative affect compared to the self-immersed perspective. Our results suggest that self-distancing modulates different levels of athletes' experience (i.e., affect and anger) and behavior. Furthermore, this demonstrates the feasibility of testing self-regulation of emotion in athletes in a laboratory setting and allows for further application in research in sports and exercise psychology.",2020,2021/01/08,Front Psychol,11,,572030,33488446.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.572030,,#1755,Michel-Krohler 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
The effect of trait anxiety on attentional mechanisms in combined context and cue conditioning and extinction learning,"Stegmann, Y.; Reicherts, P.; Andreatta, M.; Pauli, P.; Wieser, M. J.","Sensory processing and attention allocation are shaped by threat, but the role of trait-anxiety in sensory processing as a function of threat predictability remains incompletely understood. Therefore, we measured steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) as an index of sensory processing of predictable and unpredictable threat cues in 29 low (LA) and 29 high (HA) trait-anxious participants during a modified NPU-paradigm followed by an extinction phase. Three different contextual cues indicated safety (N), predictable (P) or unpredictable threat (U), while foreground cues signalled shocks in the P-condition only. All participants allocated increased attentional resources to the central P-threat cue, replicating previous findings. Importantly, LA individuals exhibited larger ssVEP amplitudes to contextual threat (U and P) than to contextual safety cues, while HA individuals did not differentiate among contextual cues in general. Further, HA exhibited higher aversive ratings of all contexts compared to LA. These results suggest that high trait-anxious individuals might be worse at discriminating contextual threat stimuli and accordingly overestimate the probability and aversiveness of unpredictable threat. These findings support the notion of aberrant sensory processing of unpredictable threat in anxiety disorders, as this processing pattern is already evident in individuals at risk of these disorders.",2019,Jun 20,Sci Rep,9,1,8855,31222028.0,10.1038/s41598-019-45239-3,,#1756,Stegmann 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Contributions of left frontal and temporal cortex to sentence comprehension: Evidence from simultaneous TMS-EEG,"Kroczek, L. O. H.; Gunter, T. C.; Rysop, A. U.; Friederici, A. D.; Hartwigsen, G.","Sentence comprehension requires the rapid analysis of semantic and syntactic information. These processes are supported by a left hemispheric dominant fronto-temporal network, including left posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG) and posterior superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (pSTG/STS). Previous electroencephalography (EEG) studies have associated semantic expectancy within a sentence with a modulation of the N400 and syntactic gender violations with increases in the LAN and P600. Here, we combined focal perturbations of neural activity by means of short bursts of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with simultaneous EEG recordings to probe the functional relevance of pIFG and pSTG/STS for sentence comprehension. We applied 10 Hz TMS bursts of three pulses at verb onset during auditory presentation of short sentences. Verb-based semantic expectancy and article-based syntactic gender requirement were manipulated for the sentence final noun. We did not find any TMS effect at the noun. However, TMS had a short-lasting impact at the mid-sentence verb that differed for the two stimulation sites. Specifically, TMS over pIFG elicited a frontal positivity in the first 200 msec post verb onset whereas TMS over pSTG/STS was limited to a parietal negativity at 200-400 msec post verb onset. This indicates that during verb processing in sentential context, frontal brain areas play an earlier role than temporal areas in predicting the upcoming noun. The short-living perturbation effects at the mid-sentence verb suggest a high degree of online compensation within the language system since the sentence final noun processing was unaffected.",2019,Jun,Cortex,115,,86-98,30776735.0,10.1016/j.cortex.2019.01.010,,#1757,Kroczek 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin transporter genotype modulate performance monitoring functions but not their electrophysiological correlates,"Fischer, A. G.; Endrass, T.; Reuter, M.; Kubisch, C.; Ullsperger, M.","Serotonin (5-HT) has been hypothesized to be implicated in performance monitoring by promoting behavioral inhibition in the face of aversive events. However, it is unclear whether this is restricted to external (punishment) or includes internal (response errors) events. The aim of the current study was to test whether higher 5-HT levels instigate inhibition specifically in the face of errors, measured as post-error slowing (PES), and whether this is represented in electrophysiological correlates of error processing, namely error-related negativity (ERN) and positivity. Therefore, from a large sample of human subjects (n = 878), two extreme groups were formed regarding hypothesized high and low 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) expression based on 5-HTTLPR and two additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs25531, rs25532). Seventeen higher (LL) and 15 lower (SS) expressing Caucasian subjects were administered the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram (10 mg) intravenously in a double-blind crossover design. We found pharmacogenetic evidence for a role of 5-HT in mediating PES: SSRI administration increased PES in both genetic groups, and SS subjects displayed higher PES. These effects were absent on post-conflict slowing. However, ERN and error positivity were unaffected by pharmacogenetic factors, but ERN was decoupled from behavioral adaptation by SSRI administration in the LL group. Thus, pharmacogenetic evidence suggests that increased 5-HT levels lead to behavioral inhibition in the context of internal aversive events, but electrophysiological correlates of performance monitoring appear unrelated to the 5-HT system. Therefore, our findings are consistent with theories suggesting that 5-HT mediates the link between aversive processing and inhibition.",2015,May 27,J Neurosci,35,21,8181-90,26019334.0,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5124-14.2015,,#1758,Fischer 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Although being more specific for the prediction of treatment success, GMM was much less sensitive than clinically significant and reliable change criteria.

In this study, we tested the impact of an extensive Dot-Probe ABM procedure, consisting of close to 7000 trials, concurrently with behavioral and electrophysiological measures within a large sample of over 100 highly socially anxious participants. Results indicated that the N2pc component demonstrates superior internal consistency and more statistical power in detecting attentional biases and their modification than reaction time (RT) differences. RTs were neither indicative of an attentional bias before ABM nor of a modification over time. In contrast, the N2pc indexed both an initial attentional preference for threatening stimuli and an alteration of this relationship after training. Outcomes were not specific for attentional training away from threat but also occurred in the no-contingency control procedure, casting doubt on the theoretic underpinnings of ABM.

While electric shock and white noise burst are among the most commonly used unconditioned stimuli (US) in conventional fear conditioning studies with few trials, it is unknown whether these stimuli are equally well suited for paradigms with many trials. Here, N = 32 participants underwent a 260-trial differential fear conditioning and extinction paradigm with a 240-trial recall test 24 h later and neutral faces as conditioned stimuli. In a between-subjects design, either white noise bursts (n = 16) or electric shocks (n = 16) served as US, and intensities were determined using the most common procedure for each US (i.e., a fixed 95 dB noise burst and a work-up procedure for electric shocks, respectively). In addition to differing US types, groups also differed in closely linked US-associated characteristics (e.g., calibration methods, stimulus intensities, timing). Subjective ratings (arousal/valence), skin conductance, and evoked heart period changes (i.e., fear bradycardia) indicated more reliable, extinction-resistant, and stable conditioning in the white noise burst versus electric shock group.

The stigma of mental illness: Testing for the implicit bias in diagnostic labels,"Schlier, B.; Lincoln, T. M.","Several models that attempt to explain stigmatization of people with mental illness emphasize the relevance of social categorization. However, research on illness-based social categories has been limited to explicit self-report measures. In this study, we explored whether implicit social categorization based on mental illness labels can be assessed with the ""Who-Said-What"" (WSW)-paradigm. In this paradigm, participants have to allocate a large number of statements to individuals who belong to different social groups (e.g., mentally ill vs. healthy). Due to the amount of statements, errors in allocation are to be expected. A disproportionate amount of erroneous allocation to individuals within a social group is interpreted to indicate implicit social categorization. In three studies, we (1) pilot-tested a WSW-paradigm for mental illness categorization (n = 24), (2) replicated these findings in an independent, larger sample (n = 85), and (3) aimed to rule out alternative explanations for the implicit categorization effects with a modified WSW-task and novel stimulus material (n = 137). We found consistent implicit categorization effects with overall medium to large effect sizes (range: 0.41 </= d </= 1.01). Implicit components of mental illness based social categorization can be assessed with the WSW-paradigm. Future research needs to explore the interrelations of implicit categorization, implicit vs. explicit stigmatization and discriminating behavior.",2019,May,Psychiatry Res,275,,221-227,30928725.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2019.03.028,,#1762,Schlier 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Which Trauma Treatment Suits me?

This study examines the treatment preferences of treatment-seeking traumatized adults in Germany and investigates the reasons for their treatment choices. Preferences for prolonged exposure, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), psychodynamic psychotherapy and stabilization were assessed via an online survey. Reasons for preferences were analyzed by means of thematic coding by two independent rates. 104 traumatized adults completed the survey. Prolonged exposure and CBT were each preferred by nearly 30%, and EMDR and psychodynamic psychotherapy were preferred by nearly 20%. Stabilization was significantly less preferred than all other options, by only 4%. Significantly higher proportions of patients were disinclined to choose EMDR and stabilization. Patients who preferred psychodynamic psychotherapy were significantly older than those who preferred CBT. Reasons underlying preferences included the perceived treatment mechanisms and treatment efficacy. Traumatized patients vary in their treatment preferences.

Here, we used longitudinal data from a general population sample of 1388 adults from Germany, who were initially assessed between April and May 2020 (i.e., at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany) and prospectively followed up after 6 (n = 1082) and 12 months (n = 945). Depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as loneliness did not change from baseline to 6-month follow-up. While anxiety symptoms did not change in the long run, depressive symptoms and loneliness increased and life satisfaction decreased from baseline to 12-month follow-up. Moreover, vulnerable groups such as younger individuals or those with a history of mental disorders exhibited an overall higher level of psychopathological symptoms across all assessment waves.

"Somatosensory spatial attention modulates amplitudes, latencies, and latency jitter of laser-evoked brain potentials","Franz, M.; Nickel, M. M.; Ritter, A.; Miltner, W. H.; Weiss, T.","Several studies provided evidence that the amplitudes of laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) are modulated by attention. However, previous reports were based on across-trial averaging of LEP responses at the expense of losing information about intertrial variability related to attentional modulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of somatosensory spatial attention on single-trial parameters (i.e., amplitudes, latencies, and latency jitter) of LEP components (N2 and P2). Twelve subjects participated in a sustained spatial attention paradigm while noxious laser stimuli (left hand) and noxious electrical stimuli (right hand) were sequentially delivered to the dorsum of the respective hand with nonnoxious air puffs randomly interspersed within the sequence of noxious stimuli. Participants were instructed to mentally count all stimuli (i.e., noxious and nonnoxious) applied to the attended location. Laser stimuli, presented to the attended hand (ALS), elicited larger single-trial amplitudes of the N2 component compared with unattended laser stimuli (ULS). In contrast, single-trial amplitudes of the P2 component were not significantly affected by spatial attention. Single-trial latencies of the N2 and P2 were significantly smaller for ALS vs. ULS. Additionally, the across-trial latency jitter of the N2 component was reduced for ALS. Conversely, the latency jitter of the P2 component was smaller for ULS compared with ALS. With the use of single-trial analysis, the study provided new insights into brain dynamics of LEPs related to spatial attention.

Suggested visual blockade during hypnosis: Top-down modulation of stimulus processing in a visual oddball task,"Franz, M.; Schmidt, B.; Hecht, H.; Naumann, E.; Miltner, W. H. R.","Several theories of hypnosis assume that responses to hypnotic suggestions are implemented through top-down modulations via a frontoparietal network that is involved in monitoring and cognitive control. The current study addressed this issue re-analyzing previously published event-related-potentials (ERP) (N1, P2, and P3b amplitudes) and combined it with source reconstruction and connectivity analysis methods. ERP data were obtained from participants engaged in a visual oddball paradigm composed of target, standard, and distractor stimuli during a hypnosis (HYP) and a control (CON) condition. In both conditions, participants were asked to count the rare targets presented on a video screen. During HYP participants received suggestions that a wooden board in front of their eyes would obstruct their view of the screen. The results showed that participants' counting accuracy was significantly impaired during HYP compared to CON. ERP components in the N1 and P2 window revealed no amplitude differences between CON and HYP at sensor-level. In contrast, P3b amplitudes in response to target stimuli were significantly reduced during HYP compared to CON. Source analysis of the P3b amplitudes in response to targets indicated that HYP was associated with reduced source activities in occipital and parietal brain areas related to stimulus categorization and attention. We further explored how these brain sources interacted by computing time-frequency effective connectivity between electrodes that best represented frontal, parietal, and occipital sources. This analysis revealed reduced directed information flow from parietal attentional to frontal executive sources during processing of target stimuli. These results provide preliminary evidence that hypnotic suggestions of a visual blockade are associated with a disruption of the coupling within the frontoparietal network implicated in top-down control.",2021,2021/09/15,PLOS ONE,16,9,e0257380,34525129.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0257380,,#1766,Franz 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

The Multidimensional Inventory of Hypochondriacal Traits (MIHT) represents an innovative instrument that was developed according to cognitive-behavioral, cognitive-perceptual, interpersonal, and trait models of hypochondriasis. We aimed at evaluating the psychometric properties of the MIHT in a sample of patients with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) diagnosis of hypochondriasis. Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the postulated four-factor structure of the MIHT was found in a first CFA in patients with hypochondriasis (n = 178) and in a second CFA based on a mixed sample, with other somatoform disorders (n = 27), panic disorder (n = 25), and healthy controls (n = 31) added to the original group of patients with hypochondriasis (n = 178). In terms of specificity, patients with hypochondriasis showed larger scores on all four MIHT subscales (i.e., affective, cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual) compared to all other groups. Analyses of convergent and discriminant validity revealed promising results concerning the MIHT affective and perceptual scales but also point to certain problematic issues concerning the MIHT cognitive and behavioral scales. The findings suggest that the proposed structure of the MIHT is valid also in patients with hypochondriasis and demonstrate the specificity of the four hypochondriacal traits assessed in the MIHT.",2015,Jun,Assessment,22,3,361-73,25092716.0,10.1177/1073191114545489,,#1768,Witthoft 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Interoception and sexual response in women with low sexual desire,"Velten, J.; Brotto, L. A.","Sexual concordance is defined as the association between genital response and self-reported sexual arousal. Though one might predict a strong association between sexual concordance and awareness of other internal physiological sensations (termed interoception), past research on sexually healthy women has not found these different domains to be related. The aim of the present study was to test the association between interoception and sexual concordance in a clinical sample of women with Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD). Fifty-two women with SIAD completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), a validated self-report measure of interoception, and completed a heart-beat accuracy test, an objective measure of interoception. They also participated in a laboratory-based assessment of physiological sexual arousal and self-reported sexual arousal while viewing an erotic film. Mental and physiological arousal were correlated at r = 0.27 (range -0.80 to 0.95). There was no significant association between sexual concordance and women's heartrate awareness. However, five aspects of interoceptive awareness (noticing, emotional awareness, self-regulation, body-listening, and trusting), were predictive of lower, and one aspect (not-distracting) was predictive of higher sexual concordance.

Although psychological traits are known to impact sexual attitudes and behavior, sexuality- and personality-related traits have not been jointly investigated to assess their relevance for sexual functioning in couples. The aim of this study was to investigate how psychological traits of two partners influence women's and men's sexual function. Data from 964 couples, representative of the adult population in Germany, were analyzed. Sexual function was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Sexuality-related traits were measured with the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women and Men (SESII-W/M). Personality was measured with self-report and partner-rating versions of the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Sexual excitation was a positive and sexual inhibition was a negative predictor of sexual function in both genders. Women whose partners were sexually inhibited reported lower sexual function. Conscientious individuals reported better sexual function. Women whose partners were more conscientious also had better sexual function.

No Sex Difference Found: Cues of Sexual Stimuli Activate the Reward System in both Sexes,"Stark, R.; Klein, S.; Kruse, O.; Weygandt, M.; Leufgens, L. K.; Schweckendiek, J.; Strahler, J.","Sexually explicit material (SEM) is increasingly used in western societies. One reason for this high usage might be the rewarding property of SEM demonstrated in many brain imaging studies showing an activation of the reward system during the presentation of SEM. It is not yet well understood why women use SEM to a remarkably lesser extent than men. Maybe men react stronger to stimuli - so called SEM cues -, which signal the presentation of SEM and are therefore more vulnerable to use SEM than women. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the sex specific neural correlates towards SEM and SEM cues. We were further interested in whether person characteristics as trait sexual motivation, extent of SEM use in the last month, and age at onset of goal-oriented SEM use affect the neural responses to SEM and SEM cues. The trials of the fMRI experiment consisted of an expectation phase with SEM or neutral cues and a presentation phase with SEM or neutral stimuli, respectively. Analyses showed that the reward circuitry was activated by SEM, but also by SEM cues. There were some sex differences in hemodynamic responses to SEM during the presentation phase, but not during the expectation phase to SEM cues in any of the regions of interest. The influence of the investigated person characteristics was only small if existent. The results suggest that sex specific cue processing cannot explain sex differences in the use of SEM.",2019,Sep 15,Neuroscience,416,,63-73,31394197.0,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.07.049,,#1771,Stark 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Cross-paradigm integration shows a common neural basis for aversive and appetitive conditioning,"Klein, S.; Kruse, O.; Tapia Leon, I.; Van Oudenhove, L.; van 't Hof, S. R.; Klucken, T.; Wager, T.

Such cross-paradigm integration has the potential to identify commonalities in findings that neighboring areas of study thought to be paradigm-specific. However, even the integration of research from closely related paradigms, such as aversive and appetitive classical conditioning is rare - even though qualitative comparisons already hint at how similar the 'fear network' and 'reward network' may be. We aimed to validate these theories by taking a multivariate approach to assess commonalities across paradigms empirically. Specifically, we quantified the similarity of an aversive conditioning pattern derived from meta-analysis to appetitive conditioning fMRI data. We tested pattern expression in three independent appetitive conditioning studies with 29, 76 and 38 participants each. During fMRI scanning, participants in each cohorts performed an appetitive conditioning task in which a CS+ was repeatedly rewarded with money and a CS- was never rewarded. The aversive pattern was highly similar to appetitive CS+ > CS- contrast maps across samples and variations of the appetitive conditioning paradigms. Moreover, the pattern distinguished the CS+ from the CS- with above-chance accuracy in every sample. These findings provide robust empirical evidence for an underlying neural system common to appetitive and aversive learning.

Do mirror glasses have the same effect on brain activity as a mirror box? Evidence from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with healthy subjects,"Milde, C.; Rance, M.; Kirsch, P.; Trojan, J.; Fuchs, X.; Foell, J.; Bekrater-Bodmann, R.; Flor, H.; Diers, M.","Since its original proposal, mirror therapy has been established as a successful neurorehabilitative intervention in several neurological disorders to recover motor function or to relieve pain. Mirror therapy seems to operate by reactivating the contralesional representation of the non-mirrored limb in primary motor- and somatosensory cortex. However, mirror boxes have some limitations which prompted the use of additional mirror visual feedback devices. The present study evaluated the utility of mirror glasses compared to a mirror box. We also tested the hypothesis that increased interhemispheric communication between the motor hand areas is the mechanism by which mirror visual feedback recruits the representation of the non-mirrored limb. Therefore, mirror illusion capacity and brain activations were measured in a within-subject design during both mirror visual feedback conditions in counterbalanced order with 20 healthy subjects inside a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Furthermore, we analyzed task-dependent functional connectivity between motor hand representations using psychophysiological interaction analysis during both mirror tasks. Neither the subjective quality of mirror illusions nor the patterns of functional brain activation differed between the mirror tasks. The sensorimotor representation of the non-mirrored hand was recruited in both mirror tasks. However, a significant increase in interhemispheric connectivity between the hand areas was only observed in the mirror glasses condition, suggesting different mechanisms for the recruitment of the representation of the non-mirrored hand in the two mirror tasks. We conclude that the mirror glasses might be a promising alternative to the mirror box, as they induce similar patterns of brain activation. Moreover, the mirror glasses can be easy applied in therapy and research. We want to emphasize that the neuronal mechanisms for the recruitment of the affected limb representation might differ depending on conceptual differences between MVF devices.

Furthermore, we investigated potential factors and mechanisms that could be associated with addictive social media use. Our cross-national findings show that the BSMAS is a unidimensional reliable and valid instrument. Moreover, they reveal that the negative association between positive mental health and addictive social media use is mediated by sense of control in seven of the nine countries (exception: China, Russia). Thus, it can be hypothesized that activities which increase positive mental health could indirectly contribute to the decrease of addictive social media use. We identified conscious engagement in physical activity and a regular sleep rhythm during the pandemic as such potential activities.

Generalization of word meanings during infant sleep,"Friedrich, M.; Wilhelm, I.; Born, J.; Friederici, A. D.","Sleep consolidates memory and promotes generalization in adults, but it is still unknown to what extent the rapidly growing infant memory benefits from sleep. Here we show that during sleep the infant brain reorganizes recent memories and creates semantic knowledge from individual episodic experiences. Infants aged between 9 and 16 months were given the opportunity to encode both objects as specific word meanings and categories as general word meanings. Event-related potentials indicate that, initially, infants acquire only the specific but not the general word meanings. About 1.5 h later, infants who napped during the retention period, but not infants who stayed awake, remember the specific word meanings and, moreover, successfully generalize words to novel category exemplars. Independently of age, the semantic generalization effect is correlated with sleep spindle activity during the nap, suggesting that sleep spindles are involved in infant sleep-dependent brain plasticity.",2015,Jan 29,Nat Commun,6,1,6004,25633407.0,10.1038/ncomms7004,,#1778,Friedrich 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Sleep and next-day negative affect and suicidal ideation in borderline personality disorder,"Kaurin, A.; Hisler, G.; Dombrovski, A. Y.; Hallquist, M. N.; Wright, A. G.

To date, however, no study has investigated the temporal relationship between sleep and suicidality among those diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). This preregistered (https://osf.io/4vugk) study tested whether nightly sleep (self-reported sleep duration, sleep onset latency, and subjective sleep quality) represents a (within-person) short-term risk factor for affective dysregulation and increases in suicide risk from day-to-day, as well as whether between-person differences in sleep, negative affect, and suicidality were associated. We used a 21-day ecological momentary assessment protocol in a sample of 153 people diagnosed with BPD, 105 of which had a history of serious suicide attempts, and 52 healthy controls (N = 4076 days). We found a within-person association between worse subjective sleep quality and greater next-day negative affect. At the between-person level, we found positive relationships between sleep latency and suicidal ideation, and a negative association between subjective sleep quality and negative affect. BPD severity did not significantly moderate the strength of any within-person associations, although BPD was positively associated with average levels of suicidal ideation, sleep latency, and negative affect, and negatively related to subjective sleep quality. These findings suggest that the association of sleep with suicidal ideation and BPD exists largely at the between-persons rather than the within-person level. Disturbed sleep, therefore, seems to largely coincide, rather than specifically contribute to, the exacerbation of suicidal crises in BPD.

To experimentally probe the aetiological role of sleep disturbances in anxiety, we investigated in healthy participants how total sleep deprivation influences fear expression in a conditioning paradigm. In a fear conditioning procedure, one face stimulus (conditioned stimulus [CS+]) was paired with electric shock, whereas another face stimulus was not (unpaired stimulus [CS-]). Fear expression was tested the next morning using the two face stimuli from the training phase and a generalization stimulus (i.e. a morph between the CS+ and CS- stimuli). Between fear conditioning and test, participants were either kept awake in the laboratory for 12 hr (n = 20) or had a night of sleep at home (n = 20).

The reciprocal relation between sleep and memory in infancy: Memory-dependent adjustment of sleep spindles and spindle-dependent improvement of memories,"Friedrich, M.; Molle, M.; Friederici, A. D.; Born, J.","Sleep spindle activity in infants supports their formation of generalized memories during sleep, indicating that specific sleep processes affect the consolidation of memories early in life. Characteristics of sleep spindles depend on the infant's developmental state and are known to be associated with trait-like factors such as intelligence. It is, however, largely unknown which state-like factors affect sleep spindles in infancy. By varying infants' wake experience in a within-subject design, here we provide evidence for a learning- and memory-dependent modulation of infant spindle activity. In a lexical-semantic learning session before a nap, 14- to 16-month-old infants were exposed to unknown words as labels for exemplars of unknown object categories. In a memory test on the next day, generalization to novel category exemplars was tested. In a nonlearning control session preceding a nap on another day, the same infants heard known words as labels for exemplars of already known categories. Central-parietal fast sleep spindles increased after the encoding of unknown object-word pairings compared to known pairings, evidencing that an infant's spindle activity varies depending on its prior knowledge for newly encoded information. Correlations suggest that enhanced spindle activity was particularly triggered, when similar unknown pairings were not generalized immediately during encoding. The spindle increase triggered by previously not generalized object-word pairings, moreover, boosted the formation of generalized memories for these pairings. Overall, the results provide first evidence for a fine-tuned regulation of infant sleep quality according to current consolidation requirements, which improves the infant long-term memory for new experiences.",2019,Mar,Dev Sci,22,2,e12743,30160012.0,10.1111/desc.12743,,#1781,Friedrich 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Upon completion of a baseline assessment, participants were randomized to either six sessions of AppBM or Sham training or a waitlist control group. In both trainings, participants were presented smoking-related and neutral pictures. While all smoking-related pictures were associated with pushing and all neutral pictures with pulling in AppBM training, the contingency was 50:50 in Sham training. Participants were re-assessed directly and six months after training. Primary outcome was daily cigarette consumption at follow-up. At follow-up, no significant group differences emerged, although AppBM training significantly reduced daily cigarette consumption directly after training. No consistent change of bias through AppBM training emerged. This study does not provide support for the long-term effectiveness of AppBM training as a stand-alone training in smoking.

"""A cigarette a day keeps the goodies away"": smokers show automatic approach tendencies for smoking--but not for food-related stimuli","Machulska, A.; Zlomuzica, A.; Adolph, D.; Rinck, M.; Margraf, J.","Smoking leads to the development of automatic tendencies that promote approach behavior toward smoking-related stimuli which in turn may maintain addictive behavior. The present study examined whether automatic approach tendencies toward smoking-related stimuli can be measured by using an adapted version of the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT). Given that progression of addictive behavior has been associated with a decreased reactivity of the brain reward system for stimuli signaling natural rewards, we also used the AAT to measure approach behavior toward natural rewarding stimuli in smokers. During the AAT, 92 smokers and 51 non-smokers viewed smoking-related vs. non-smoking-related pictures and pictures of natural rewards (i.e. highly palatable food) vs. neutral pictures. They were instructed to ignore image content and to respond to picture orientation by either pulling or pushing a joystick. Within-group comparisons revealed that smokers showed an automatic approach bias exclusively for smoking-related pictures. Contrary to our expectations, there was no difference in smokers' and non-smokers' approach bias for nicotine-related stimuli, indicating that non-smokers also showed approach tendencies for this picture category. Yet, in contrast to non-smokers, smokers did not show an approach bias for food-related pictures. Moreover, self-reported smoking attitude could not predict approach-avoidance behavior toward nicotine-related pictures in smokers or non-smokers. Our findings indicate that the AAT is suited for measuring smoking-related approach tendencies in smokers. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a diminished approach tendency toward food-related stimuli in smokers, suggesting a decreased sensitivity to natural rewards in the course of nicotine addiction. Our results indicate that in contrast to similar studies conducted in alcohol, cannabis and heroin users, the AAT might only be partially suited for measuring smoking-related approach tendencies in smokers. Nevertheless, our findings are of special importance for current etiological models and smoking cessation programs aimed at modifying nicotine-related approach tendencies in the context of a nicotine addiction.",2015,2015/02/18,PLOS ONE,10,2,e0116464,25692468.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0116464,,#1784,Machulska 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Repeated stress leads to enhanced cortisol stress response in child social anxiety disorder but this effect can be prevented with CBT,"Asbrand, J.; Heinrichs, N.; Nitschke, K.; Wolf, O. T.; Schmidtendorf, S.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with continual social stress in everyday life. Two physiological components of stress are the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, as captured by cortisol reactivity, and the autonomous nervous system, as captured by salivary alpha amylase (sAA) reactivity. In children with SAD, initial evidence points to dysregulated physiological stress reactivity for both systems. Furthermore, hardly any studies have assessed stress reactivity twice, including exploring possible changes after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Children with SAD (n = 65; aged 9-13 years) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 55) participated in a social stress task (Trier Social Stress Test for Children, TSST-C), which was repeated with children with SAD after either 12 sessions of CBT or a waiting period to explore possible habituation or sensitization effects. Before treatment, children in the SAD and HC groups did not differ in their cortisol stress reactivity toward the TSST-C but did differ in their sAA response with a more pronounced response in the SAD group. After treatment, children with SAD in the waitlist group differed from children with SAD in the CBT group by showing stronger cortisol reactivity and a higher responder rate, indicative of a possible sensitization to stress. No difference was found for sAA.

Integrative systemic and family therapy for social anxiety disorder: Manual and practice in a pilot randomized controlled trial (SOPHO-CBT/ST),"Hunger-Schoppe, C.; Schweitzer, J.; Hilzinger, R.; Krempel, L.; Deusser, L.; Sander, A.; Bents, H.; Mander, J.; Lieb, H.","Social anxiety disorders (SAD) are among the most prevalent mental disorders (lifetime prevalence: 7-12%), with high impact on the life of an affected social system and its individual social system members. We developed a manualized disorder-specific integrative systemic and family therapy (ISFT) for SAD, and evaluated its feasibility in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The ISFT is inspired by Helm Stierlin's concept of related individuation developed during the early 1980s, which has since continued to be refined. It integrates solution-focused language, social network diagnostics, and genogram work, as well as resource- and problem orientation for both case conceptualization and therapy planning. Post-Milan symptom prescription to fluidize the presented symptoms is one of the core interventions in the ISFT. Theoretically, the IFST is grounded in radical constructivism and ""Cybern-Ethics,"" multi-directional partiality, and a both/and attitude toward a disorder-specific vs. non-disorder-specific therapy approach. SAD is understood from the viewpoint of social systems theory, especially in adaptation to a socio-psycho-biological explanatory model of social anxiety. In a prospective multicenter, assessor-blind pilot RCT, we included 38 clients with SAD (ICD F40.1; Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, LSAS-SR > 30): 18 patients participated in the ISFT, and 20 patients in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT; age: M = 36 years, SD = 14). Within-group, simple-effect intention-to-treat analyses showed significant reduction in social anxiety (LSAS-SR; ISFT: d = 1.67; CBT: d = 1.04), while intention-to-treat mixed-design ANOVA demonstrated the advantage of ISFT (d = 0.81). Per-protocol analyses supported these results. The remission rate based on blind diagnosticians' ratings was good to satisfactory (Structured Clinical Interview, SCID; 78% in ST, 45% in CBT, p = 0.083); this has yet to be verified in a subsequent confirmatory RCT.

When interoception helps to overcome negative feelings caused by social exclusion,"Pollatos, O.; Matthias, E.; Keller, J.","Social exclusion affects mental and physical health. The ability to regulate emotional responses to social exclusion is therefore essential for our well-being. As individual differences in detecting bodily signals (interoceptive sensitivity, IS) have been associated with the ability of emotion regulation, we aimed at exploring whether IS fosters coping with social exclusion and flexibility in emotion regulation. The first study investigated subjective feelings and behavioral affiliation tendencies in response to ostracism using a cyberball paradigm. Sixty-nine participants were assessed who differed with respect to IS. The second study examined habitual emotion regulation processes focusing on suppression and reappraisal as well as IS in 116 participants. Main results were that the effect of ostracism on distress and behavioral affiliation tendencies were qualified by IS-being ostracized had less impact on participants with stronger IS. Furthermore, Study 2 revealed that IS was associated with habitually stronger emotion regulation strategies. We conclude that having access to bodily signals helps (IS) reducing aversive states provoked by social exclusion, probably due to the fact that IS is associated with emotion regulation strategies.",2015,2015/06/15,Front Psychol,6,,786,26124734.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00786,,#1787,Pollatos 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Angry facial expressions bias towards aversive actions,"Kroczek, L. O.

In face-to-face interactions, aversive or appetitive actions typically co-occur with emotional expressions, allowing an observer to anticipate action intentions. In the present study, we investigated the influence of facial emotions on the processing of action intentions. Thirty-two participants were presented with video clips showing virtual agents displaying a facial emotion (angry vs. happy) while performing an action (punch vs. fist-bump) directed towards the observer. During each trial, video clips stopped at varying durations of the unfolding action, and participants had to recognize the presented action. Naturally, participants' recognition accuracy improved with increasing duration of the unfolding actions. Interestingly, while facial emotions did not influence accuracy, there was a significant influence on participants' action judgements. Participants were more likely to judge a presented action as a punch when agents showed an angry compared to a happy facial emotion. This effect was more pronounced in short video clips, showing only the beginning of an unfolding action, than in long video clips, showing near-complete actions. These results suggest that facial emotions influence anticipatory processing of action intentions allowing for fast and adaptive responses in social interactions.",2021,2021/09/01,PLOS ONE,16,9,e0256912,34469494.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0256912,,#1788,Kroczek 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Development and validation of a new instrument to measure social pain,"Stangier, U.; Schuller, J.; Brahler, E.","Social pain is an emotional reaction to social exclusion which has been widely investigated in experimental settings.

Using three different subsamples (Online convenience sample: n = 623, Representative sample: n = 2531, Clinical sample of outpatients seeking psychotherapy: n = 270) we reduced the item pool to 10 items for the final SPQ scale, paying particular attention to content validity and factorial structure. Convergent, divergent and discriminant validity were assessed using standardized measures of related constructs and group differences. For the final 10-item version, a good factorial structure and reliability were found. Convergent validity was supported by correlations with related instruments of interpersonal sensitivity, attachment styles, depression and social anxiety. The representative and clinical sample differed significantly in social pain. The SPQ is an economic self-report measure with solid psychometric properties.

Stressed in afterthought: Neuroendocrine effects of social self-threat during physical effort are counteracted by performance feedback after stress exposure,"Finke, J. B.; Behrje, A.; Hesslenberg, E.; Klucken, T.; Schachinger, H.","Social self-threat during physical stress, such as exposure to the cold pressor test and isometric handgrip test, has been shown to induce activation of the HPA axis, in addition to autonomic responses. However, previous research has suggested that dysfunctional post-event processing may play a major role in neuroendocrine reactivity at initial as well as subsequent social stress exposure. In the present study, we investigated how the interplay of context (i.e. performance feedback) with state (i.e., self-esteem) as well as trait-like factors (i.e., ruminative tendencies) affects stress responses to repeated, short bouts of physical activity. On two sessions, 1 week apart, 53 participants (27 women) performed an isometric handgrip task for 3 min, during which they were exposed to social-evaluative threat. In addition, participants received fake feedback on their performance immediately after the task, labeling it as either 'above' (positive) or 'below average' (negative). In addition to neuroendocrine (cortisol), cardiovascular (heart rate, blood pressure) and subjective stress reactivity, performance-related and social dimensions of state self-esteem were assessed before and after stress induction. Substantial increases in cardiovascular parameters were found on both days, regardless of feedback condition. However, positive feedback led to significantly diminished neuroendocrine responses on day 1, whereas baseline cortisol on session 2 was significantly higher in the negative feedback group. Conversely, social self-esteem decreased after stress induction on both days only for participants who had received negative feedback. Changes in self-esteem reported on day 1 were associated with increased baseline cortisol at the second session, while interindividual differences in self-reported (trait) rumination were associated with cortisol reactivity at session 1. Taken together, the results suggest that effects of social evaluation during short periods of physical stress rely on post-event processing and might be counteracted by positive appraisal directly after stress exposure. Post-hoc framing (in terms of success vs. failure) may predict subsequent stress-related hormonal effects better than task demands per se, which should be considered as a potential moderator in future acute stress research, but might also be relevant to many practical applications in fields ranging from sports/performance to health psychology.",2022,May,Psychoneuroendocrinology,139,,105703,35227928.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2022.105703,,#1791,Finke 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Studies of cortical activity have shown that event-related potentials (ERPs) of motivated attention are modulated during fear conditioning. The time course of motivated attention in learning and extinction of fear is, however, still largely unknown. We aimed to study temporal dynamics of learning processes in classical fear conditioning to social cues (neutral faces) by selecting an experimental setup that produces large effects on well-studied ERP components (early posterior negativity, EPN; late positive potential, LPP; stimulus preceding negativity, SPN) and then exploring small consecutive groups of trials. EPN, LPP, and SPN markedly and quickly increased during the acquisition phase in response to the CS+ but not the CS-. These changes were visible even at high temporal resolution and vanished completely during extinction. Moreover, some evidence was found for component differences in extinction learning, with differences between CS+ and CS- extinguishing faster for late as compared to early ERP components. Results demonstrate that fear learning to social cues is a very fast and highly plastic process and conceptually different ERPs of motivated attention are sensitive to these changes at high temporal resolution, pointing to specific neurocognitive and affective processes of social fear learning.",2019,Feb 13,Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci,14,2,189-203,30481357.0,10.1093/scan/nsy103,,#1792,FerreiradeSa 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Neural correlates of facilitations in face learning by selective caricaturing of facial shape or reflectance,"Itz, M. L.; Schweinberger, S. R.; Schulz, C.; Kaufmann, J.

Moreover, spatial information may be particularly important for encoding unfamiliar faces, but less so for recognizing familiar faces (Kaufmann et al., 2013). To directly test the possibility of a major role of reflectance information for the recognition of familiar faces, we compared effects of selective photorealistic caricaturing in either shape or reflectance on face learning and recognition. Participants learned 3D-photographed faces across different viewpoints, and different images were presented at learning and test. At test, performance benefits for both types of caricatures were modulated by familiarity: Benefits for learned faces were substantially larger for reflectance caricatures, whereas benefits for novel faces were numerically larger for shape caricatures. ERPs confirmed a consistent reduction of the occipitotemporal P200 (200-240 ms) by shape caricaturing, whereas the most prominent effect of reflectance caricaturing was seen in an enhanced posterior N250 (240-400 ms), a component that has been related to the activation of acquired face representations. Our results suggest that performance benefits for face learning caused by distinctive spatial versus reflectance information are mediated by different neural processes with different timing and support a prominent role of reflectance for the recognition of learned faces.",2014,Nov 15,NeuroImage,102 Pt 2,,736-47,25173417.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.042,,#1794,Itz 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Recognizing visual speech: Reduced responses in visual-movement regions, but not other speech regions in autism","Borowiak, K.; Schelinski, S.; von Kriegstein, K.","Speech information inherent in face movements is important for understanding what is said in face-to-face communication. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have difficulties in extracting speech information from face movements, a process called visual-speech recognition. Currently, it is unknown what dysfunctional brain regions or networks underlie the visual-speech recognition deficit in ASD. We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with concurrent eye tracking to investigate visual-speech recognition in adults diagnosed with high-functioning autism and pairwise matched typically developed controls. Compared to the control group (n = 17), the ASD group (n = 17) showed decreased Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response during visual-speech recognition in the right visual area 5 (V5/MT) and left temporal visual speech area (TVSA) - brain regions implicated in visual-movement perception. The right V5/MT showed positive correlation with visual-speech task performance in the ASD group, but not in the control group. Psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI) revealed that functional connectivity between the left TVSA and the bilateral V5/MT and between the right V5/MT and the left IFG was lower in the ASD than in the control group. In contrast, responses in other speech-motor regions and their connectivity were on the neurotypical level. Reduced responses and network connectivity of the visual-movement regions in conjunction with intact speech-related mechanisms indicate that perceptual mechanisms might be at the core of the visual-speech recognition deficit in ASD. Communication deficits in ASD might at least partly stem from atypical sensory processing and not higher-order cognitive processing of socially relevant information.",2018,,Neuroimage Clin,20,,1078-1091,30368195.0,10.1016/j.nicl.2018.09.019,,#1795,Borowiak 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

"Emotion regulation as a predictor of the endocrine, autonomic, affective, and symptomatic stress response and recovery","Krkovic, K.; Clamor, A.; Lincoln, T. M.","Stress is associated with the development of mental disorders such as depression and psychosis. The ability to regulate emotions is likely to influence how individuals respond to and recover from acute stress, and may thus be relevant to symptom development. To test this, we investigated whether self-reported emotion regulation predicts the endocrine, autonomic, affective, and symptomatic response to and recovery from a stressor. Social-evaluative stress was induced by the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in N = 67 healthy individuals (53.7% female, M(age) = 29.9). Self-reported habitual emotion regulation skills were assessed at baseline. We measured salivary cortisol, heart rate, negative affect, state depression and state paranoia at three time points: pre-TSST, post-TSST, and after a 10 min recovery phase. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed all indicators to significantly increase in response to the stressor (p < .001) and decrease during the recovery phase (p < .001), except for salivary cortisol, which showed a linear increase (p < .001). The habitual use of maladaptive emotion regulation (e.g., rumination, catastrophizing) significantly predicted an increased affective and reduced cortisol response. Adaptive emotion regulation (e.g., acceptance, reappraisal) was not predictive of the stress response for any of the indicators. Neither type of emotion regulation predicted response during the stress recovery phase. Individuals who habitually resort to maladaptive emotion regulation strategies show a stronger affective and a blunted endocrine stress response, which may make them vulnerable to mental health problems. However, further research is needed to identify the full scope of skills required for effective stress-regulation before this knowledge can be used to develop effective prevention programs.",2018,Aug,Psychoneuroendocrinology,94,,112-120,29775874.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.04.028,,#1798,Krkovic 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

In additional explorative analyses, an interaction among carbon monoxide (CO) levels in expired air, cortisol levels, and stress on approach bias for smoking-related cues was found. Higher CO levels, possibly due to recent smoking, prior to stress exposure were associated with an approach bias for smoking-related cues.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype on amygdala reactivity and effective connectivity during fear conditioning, as well as structural connectivity [as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)]. To integrate different classification strategies, we used the bi-allelic (s-allele vs l/l-allele group) as well as the tri-allelic (low-functioning vs high-functioning) classification approach. S-allele carriers showed exaggerated amygdala reactivity and elevated amygdala-insula coupling during fear conditioning (CS + > CS-) compared with the l/l-allele group. In addition, DTI analysis showed increased fractional anisotropy values in s-allele carriers within the uncinate fasciculus. Using the tri-allelic classification approach, increased amygdala reactivity and amygdala insula coupling were observed in the low-functioning compared with the high-functioning group.

The authors addressed this issue by investigating a nonclinical population and compared prevalence of BPD, impulsivity, and depressivity in various age groups from adolescence to late adulthood (N = 2,488); all individuals were assessed by standardized clinical interviews. Syndromal and subsyndromal BPD rates sharply decreased between adolescents and young adults and remained stable thereafter. Whereas the same course was found for impulsivity, depressivity increased between young, middle-aged, and older adults.

Such disruptions to parent-child interactions have been observed during parental media use such as texting and these disruptions have been termed technoference. In the present study, we explored changes to mother-child interactions that occur before, during and after interruptions due to texting using an adapted naturalistic still face paradigm. Specifically, we examined the effect of an interruption due to either maternal smartphone use or use of an analog medium on maternal interaction quality with their 20- to 22-month-old children. Mother-child interactions during free play were interrupted for 2 min by asking the mothers to fill out a questionnaire either (a) by typing on the smartphone (smartphone group) or (b) on paper with a pen (paper-pencil group). Interactional quality was compared between free-play and interruption phases and to a no-interruption control group. Mixed ANOVA across phase and condition indicated that maternal responsiveness and pedagogical behavior decreased during the interruption phase for both the interruption groups (smartphone and paper-and-pencil) but not for the no-interruption group. Children also increased their positive bids for attention during the paper-and-pencil and the smartphone conditions relative to the no-interruption control. These findings are consistent with a large body of research on the still-face paradigm and with a recent study demonstrating that smartphone interruptions decreased parenting quality. The present study, however, connects these lines of research showing the many everyday disruptions to parent-child interactions are likely to decrease parenting quality and that toddlers are likely to detect and attempt to repair such interruptions.",2021,2021/03/29,Front Psychol,12,,616656,33854461.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.616656,,#1806,Konrad 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Subsequent memory effects on event-related potentials in associative fear learning,"Wiemer, J.; Leimeister, F.; Pauli, P.","Studies of human fear learning suggest that a reliable discrimination between safe and threatening stimuli is important for survival and mental health. In the current study, we applied the subsequent memory paradigm in order to identify neurophysiological correlates of successful threat and safety learning. We recorded event-related potentials, while participants incidentally learned associations between multiple neutral faces and an aversive outcome [unconditioned stimulus (US)/conditioned stimulus (CS)+] or no outcome (noUS/CS-). We found that an enhanced late positive potential (LPP) to both CS+ and CS- during learning predicted subsequent memory. A quadratic relationship between LPP and confidence in memory indicates a possible role in both correct and false fear memory. Importantly, the P300 to the omission of the US (following CS-) was enhanced for remembered CS-, while there was a positive correlation between P300 amplitude to both US occurrence and omission and individual memory performance. A following re-exposure phase indicated that memory was indeed related to subjective fear of the CS+/CS-. These results highlight the importance of cognitive resource allocation to both threat and safety for the acquisition of fear and suggest a potential role of the P300 to US omission as an electrophysiological marker of successful safety learning.",2021,May 4,Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci,16,5,525-536,33522590.0,10.1093/scan/nsab015,,#1807,Wiemer 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Difficulties in Conducting Long Term Follow Ups in Psychotherapy Research-Issues in the Literature and Data From a Randomized Therapy Comparison Study for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Konig, J.; Karl, R.; Rosner, R.; Butollo, W.","Studies of psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) typically encompass short follow-up periods, leading to a dearth of information on the long-term course of symptoms after treatment.

We explored structural differences between antisocial offenders with either borderline personality disorder (ASPD-BPD) or high psychopathic traits (ASPD-PP) and healthy controls (CON) using region-of-interest-based and voxel-based morphometry approaches. Besides common distinct clusters of reduced gray matter volumes within the frontal pole and occipital cortex, there was remarkably little overlap in the regional distribution of brain abnormalities in ASPD-BPD and ASPD-PP, when compared to CON. Specific alterations of ASPD-BPD were detected in orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex regions subserving emotion regulation and reactive aggression and the temporal pole, which is involved in the interpretation of other peoples' motives. Volumetric reductions in ASPD-PP were most significant in midline cortical areas involved in the processing of self-referential information and self-reflection (i.e., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/precuneus) and recognizing emotions of others (postcentral gyrus) and could reflect neural correlates of the psychopathic core features of callousness and poor moral judgment.

Frontal EEG asymmetry during symptom provocation predicts subjective responses to intrusions in survivors with and without PTSD,"Meyer, T.; Quaedflieg, Cwem; Weijland, K.; Schruers, K.; Merckelbach, H.; Smeets, T.","Studies suggest that frontal alpha asymmetry is closely linked to psychological adjustment following stressful experiences, such that more left-sided frontal activation during symptom provocation might predict lower levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, we tested whether frontal asymmetry at rest and during exposure to neutral, positive, negative, and trauma-related images would be associated with PTSD, and particularly with characteristic reexperiencing symptoms. Symptoms were assessed in trauma victims with (n = 24) and without PTSD (n = 15), using both retrospective measures and 1-week ambulatory assessments with a diary and a smartphone. While resting frontal asymmetry was unrelated to all retrospective measures, left-sided activation in response to the negative picture correlated with lower levels of psychopathology. Left-sided activation in the trauma-related picture condition was more specifically associated with less emotionally intense intrusions and responses to viewing the picture, even when corrected for other symptoms of psychopathology. These effects tended to increase when participants with possible overreporting tendencies were removed from the analyses. Moreover, trauma victims without PTSD (i.e., relatively more resilient individuals) displayed higher left-sided frontal activation in response to the negative picture, also when compared with a third group of healthy, trauma-free individuals (n = 15). Our findings suggest that state-dependent changes in frontal asymmetry could serve as a biological marker of PTSD symptoms and could eventually be used for diagnostic purposes or as a target for neuromodulation interventions. Future studies should establish whether this marker can serve as an early predictor of psychopathology in recently traumatized individuals.",2018,Jan,Psychophysiology,55,1,e12779,28295402.0,10.1111/psyp.12779,,#1811,Meyer 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Cross-cultural adaption of the German Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale: an exposure-specific measurement for back pain patients,"Riecke, J.; Holzapfel, S.; Rief, W.; Lachnit, H.; Glombiewski, J.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to examine reliability and validity of a cross-cultural adaption of the German Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale (QBPDS) in a context of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of graded in vivo exposure in chronic low back pain patients. BACKGROUND: The QBPDS is one of the most widely used disease-specific disability questionnaires. In particular, for cognitive behavioral treatments with a clear focus on behavioral aspects such as graded in vivo exposure, the QBPDS provides an ascertained strategy with a sound conceptual basis and excellent quality criteria. Nevertheless, there is conflicting evidence concerning factor structure and a German adaption is missing. METHODS: The cross-cultural adaption followed international guidelines. Psychometric testing was performed using data from 180 participants with chronic low back pain. The psychometric analyses included internal consistency, convergent, and divergent validity. Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the underlying factor structure. RESULTS: The QBPDS showed strong psychometric properties, with high internal consistency for the full scale (alpha=0.94) and good convergent and divergent validity. The factor analysis revealed a four-factor solution (bending, ambulation, brief effortful movements, and long-lasting postures). CONCLUSION: The translation and cross-cultural adaption of the QBPDS into German was successful. The German version proved to be a valid and reliable instrument and is well suited for use in the context of an exposure-based psychological treatment.",2016,2016/01,J Pain Res,9,,9-15,26811693.0,10.2147/JPR.S92615,,#1812,Riecke 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
The effect of subjective social status on depressive thinking: An experimental examination,"Schubert, T.; Sussenbach, P.; Schafer, S.

Both objective and subjective measures of social status are strongly related with depression. Cognitive mechanisms such as depressive cognitions, rumination, and a negative cognitive style are seen as both concomitant and antecedent to depression. This experiment examined the causal role of SSS in developing depressive thinking. Participants were randomly assigned to a low and a high status group and followed a manipulation procedure targeting their SSS. Depressive thinking was subsequently assessed by depressive cognitions, stress-reactive state rumination and negative cognitive style. Low status participants exhibited higher levels of depressive cognitions and rumination compared to their high status counterparts, but both groups did not differ regarding their cognitive style. Findings support the causal nature of the relationship between SSS and depressive thinking. Several mechanisms of how low SSS may lead to depression are discussed.",2016,Jul 30,Psychiatry Res,241,,22-5,27152906.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2016.04.081,,#1814,Schubert 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
On the impairment of executive control of attention in chronic tinnitus: Evidence from the attention network test,"Jensen, M.; Huttenrauch, E.; Muller-Mazzotta, J.; Stuck, B. A.; Weise, C.","Subjective, chronic tinnitus is a condition that is common in most populations. Whereas many individuals tend to habituate to tinnitus over time, for some their attention seems pathologically drawn towards the sensation. For this subgroup of individuals with severe tinnitus, dysfunctional executive attention has been suggested to be implicated in the failure to habituate. However, since most previous studies have used attention tests with low validity and specificity in this assessment, there is a need for further corroborating studies. In the present study, the Attention Network Test was used to compare mainly the efficiency of executive attention between a group of individuals with chronic tinnitus (TG; n = 33) and a healthy control group (CG; n = 37). The results showed that individuals with chronic tinnitus, compared to the CG, did not present with a specific impairment in executive control of attention, nor in any of the other two attention domains. These findings are discussed in relation to the sampling characteristics in this study, which might have led to the sample being more homogenous and high functioning than samples in tinnitus studies generally. Overall, this study suggests that tinnitus and executive control of attention impairment might not be directly related, and that the latter might not necessarily be associated with the maintenance of the condition.",2021,Sep 24,Behav Brain Res,414,,113493,34329668.0,10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113493,,#1815,Jensen 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Learning processes underlying avoidance of negative outcomes,"Andreatta, M.; Michelmann, S.; Pauli, P.; Hewig, J.","Successful avoidance of a threatening event may negatively reinforce the behavior due to activation of brain structures involved in reward processing. Here, we further investigated the learning-related properties of avoidance using feedback-related negativity (FRN). The FRN is modulated by violations of an intended outcome (prediction error, PE), that is, the bigger the difference between intended and actual outcome, the larger the FRN amplitude is. Twenty-eight participants underwent an operant conditioning paradigm, in which a behavior (button press) allowed them to avoid a painful electric shock. During two learning blocks, participants could avoid an electric shock in 80% of the trials by pressing one button (avoidance button), or by not pressing another button (punishment button). After learning, participants underwent two test blocks, which were identical to the learning ones except that no shocks were delivered. Participants pressed the avoidance button more often than the punishment button. Importantly, response frequency increased throughout the learning blocks but it did not decrease during the test blocks, indicating impaired extinction and/or habit formation. In line with a PE account, FRN amplitude to negative feedback after correct responses (i.e., unexpected punishment) was significantly larger than to positive feedback (i.e., expected omission of punishment), and it increased throughout the blocks. Highly anxious individuals showed equal FRN amplitudes to negative and positive feedback, suggesting impaired discrimination. These results confirm the role of negative reinforcement in motivating behavior and learning, and reveal important differences between high and low anxious individuals in the processing of prediction errors.",2017,Apr,Psychophysiology,54,4,578-590,28176352.0,10.1111/psyp.12822,,#1816,Andreatta 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

To do so, we used a paradigm to measure neural responses during both explicit and implicit facial affect recognition (FAR) in mothers and non-mothers using child and adult faces. Increased activation to child compared to adult faces was found for mothers and non-mothers in face processing areas (bilateral fusiform gyri) and areas associated with social understanding (bilateral insulae and medial superior frontal gyrus) when pooling implicit and explicit affect recognition. Furthermore, this child-evoked activation was modulated by motherhood with an increase in mothers compared to non-mothers in the left precuneus. Additionally, explicitly recognising the affect increased child-evoked activation in the medial superior frontal gyrus in both mothers and non-mothers.

As these two functions have mostly been investigated in isolation, the specificity of the underlying neural networks and the relation of these networks to the respective behavioral indices could not be tested. Here, we present a novel fMRI paradigm (EmpaToM) that independently manipulates both empathy and ToM. Experiments 1a/b (N=90) validated the task with established empathy and ToM paradigms on a behavioral and neural level. Experiment 2 (N=178) employed the EmpaToM and revealed clearly separable neural networks including anterior insula for empathy and ventral temporoparietal junction for ToM. These distinct networks could be replicated in task-free resting state functional connectivity. Importantly, brain activity in these two networks specifically predicted the respective behavioral indices, that is, inter-individual differences in ToM related brain activity predicted inter-individual differences in ToM performance, but not empathic responding, and vice versa. Taken together, the validated EmpaToM allows separation of affective and cognitive routes to understanding others.

Additionally, we provide data on the ability of the items to capture moment-to-moment variability and discuss feasibility aspects of EMA studies on suicidal ideation in a clinical sample. Psychiatric inpatients diagnosed with a depressive disorder (N = 74) rated a set of 28 items measuring suicidal ideation, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, depression, anxiety, hopelessness, and positive affect 10 times per day on 6 consecutive days. In addition, these constructs were assessed by self-report questionnaires before and after the EMA period. Intraclass correlations and mean squared successive differences were calculated as indicators of item variability. Reliability was calculated at the prompt (within-person) and the person (between-person) level, applying an approach based on multilevel factor analysis. Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the EMA scores with a self-report questionnaire measuring the same constructs. All items demonstrated moment-to-moment-variability and substantial within-person variance. Moreover, all items and scales, except those assessing anxiety, showed satisfying reliability at the prompt and the person level, and correlations indicated convergent validity of the EMA item set.

Direct suppression as a mechanism for controlling unpleasant memories in daily life,"Kupper, C. S.; Benoit, R. G.; Dalgleish, T.; Anderson, M. C.","Suppressing unwanted memories can impair their later recall. Recent work shows that this forgetting is achieved by at least two mechanisms supported by distinct neural systems: thought substitution and direct suppression (Benoit & Anderson, 2012). Here, we examined whether direct suppression, thought to be achieved by down-regulation of hippocampal activity, can disrupt memory of aversive scenes, and, if so, whether this disruption is linked to people's perception of their ability to control intrusive thoughts. We presented participants with strong naturalistic reminders to aversive scenes and asked them to either covertly retrieve or directly suppress the associated scenes. Later, participants were cued with the reminders and asked to recall the scenes in detail. Direct suppression reduced recall probability of the scenes and also reduced the number of details recalled, even when scenes were remembered. Deficits in recall arose for minor details but also for details central to each scene's gist. Participants with higher self-perceived control abilities over intrusive thoughts showed greater forgetting than did those reporting lower levels of control. These findings suggest that inhibitory processes underlying direct suppression can disrupt retention of aversive visual memories and link those processes to individual differences in control over intrusive thoughts in everyday life. These findings reinforce the possibility that inhibition may be less efficient in people likely to acquire posttraumatic stress disorder in the wake of a traumatic experience.",2014,Aug,J Exp Psychol Gen,143,4,1443-9,24749897.0,10.1037/a0036518,,#1824,Kupper 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The Complex Dynamics of Resources and Maintaining Factors in Social Networks for Alcohol-Use Disorders: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Braus, N.; Kewitz, S.; Hunger-Schoppe, C.","Systemic therapy considers the complex dynamics of relational factors and resources contributing to psychological symptoms. Negative maintaining factors have been well researched for people suffering from Alcohol-use Disorders (AUD). However, we know little about the complex dynamics of these negative factors and resources. We interviewed fifty-five participants suffering or fully remitted from Alcohol-use disorders in this cross-sectional study (M = 52 years; 33% female). The interviews focused on relational factors (e.g., social support and social negativity) referring to a Support Social Network and a Craving Social Network (CSN). The CSN included all significant others who were associated with craving situations. We compared the network characteristics of the group suffering from Alcohol-use Disorders (n = 38) to a fully remitted control group (n = 17). The abstinent group with full remission named on average fewer individuals in the CSNs. They had lower social negativity mean scores in the Support Social Network compared to the non-remitted group (d = 0.74). In the CSN, the mean scores of social support were significantly higher than the median for both groups (d = 2.50). These findings reveal the complex interplay of relational patterns contributing to the etiology, maintenance, and recovery from Alcohol-use disorders. A successful recovery can be linked to increased social resources and reduced relations associated with craving. However, craving-associated relations represent an important source of social support.

Correlations were performed to evaluate the relationship between ventricular and subcortical volumes, with Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS) in each group. Lateral ventricular volumes correlated negatively with subcortical volumes in individuals with 22q11DS. In individuals with 22q11DS with PS only, GAF correlated positively with volumes of the lateral ventricles and negatively with subcortical volumes. PAS correlated negatively with lateral ventricle volumes, and positively with volumes of subcortical structures. The results suggest a common neurodevelopmental mechanism related to the growth of these brain structures. Further, the ratio between the volumes and clinical measures could potentially be used to characterize individuals with 22q11DS and those from the general population for the risk of the development of schizophrenia.",2021,Jul,Psychiatry Res,301,,113979,33993037.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113979,,#1829,Heller 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Punishment has a persistent effect on error-related brain activity in highly anxious individuals twenty-four hours after conditioning,"Riesel, A.; Kathmann, N.; Wullhorst, V.; Banica, I.; Weinberg, A.","The ability to detect and respond to errors, and to subsequently recruit cognitive control to remediate those errors, is critical to successful adaptation in a changing environment. However, there is also evidence that, for anxious individuals, this error signal is enhanced, highlighting affective and motivational influences on error monitoring. These individual differences arise as a function of both genetic influences and learning experiences. In this study, we examined punishment-based modulation of the error-related negativity (ERN) in high and low anxious individuals across two days. Twenty-two low- and 25 high-anxious participants performed a Flanker task in a standard and punishment condition in three phases (Day one: acquisition and extinction 1, Day two: extinction 2). During the acquisition phase, errors in one condition were punished by a loud noise. This was followed by an immediate extinction phase (extinction 1), during which errors were no longer punished, and an identical extinction phase 24 h later (extinction 2). Only high anxious individuals showed increased ERN amplitudes in the punishment compared to the standard condition. This effect was not modulated by phase and was observed across acquisition and both extinction phases, such that anxious individuals appeared not to learn that the threat value of formerly-punished errors had changed in the course of the experiment. These data suggest that environmental factors (i.e., punishment) can have a persistent effect on the magnitude of the ERN, particularly for anxious individuals. This may point to a pathogenic mechanism linking learning experiences with the development of overactive error-monitoring in anxiety.",2019,Dec,Int J Psychophysiol,146,,63-72,31648027.0,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2019.09.014,,#1830,Riesel 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Activation of thalamus in motor imagery results from gating by hypnosis,"Muller, K.; Bacht, K.; Prochnow, D.; Schramm, S.; Seitz, R. J.","The ability to mentally imagine the performance of automatic movements has been well-established being employed in sports and physiotherapy as a tool for motor learning and rehabilitation. This is probably mediated by engagement of the same brain areas as during real motor performance. Here we investigated the effect of hypnotic trance on the cerebral activation pattern engaged in motor imagery in 16 healthy, right-handed subjects using fMRI. Motor imagery as compared with rest was related to activations in the left medial frontal areas (preSMA/SMA), prefrontal- and frontal areas, putamen and inferior parietal areas. When compared with performance of the same movements motor imagery resulted in activation of the left middle frontal cortex, precuneus, and posterior cingulate. Under hypnotic trance there was one extra-activation in the left thalamus which occurred specifically in the motor imagery condition. The regional beta indices were highly correlated among the areas of the cortical-subcortical motor network. Our data accord with the notion that hypnotic trance enhances the motor control circuit engaged in motor imagery by modulating the gating function of the thalamus.",2013,Feb 1,NeuroImage,66,,361-7,23128080.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.10.073,,#1831,Muller 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Script-based Reappraisal Test introducing a new paradigm to investigate the effect of reappraisal inventiveness on reappraisal effectiveness,"Zeier, P.; Sandner, M.; Wessa, M.","The ability to regulate emotions is essential for psychological well-being. Therefore, it is particularly important to investigate the specific dynamics of emotion regulation. In a new approach, we developed a novel paradigm - the Script-based Reappraisal Test (SRT) - to measure the processes involved in reappraisal, especially reappraisal inventiveness, i.e. the ability to create multiple and differing reappraisals. The aim of this study was twofold: (1) experimentally validate the SRT and (2) investigate whether reappraisal inventiveness increases reappraisal effectiveness. Healthy students (N = 143) completed the SRT. In this task, we presented everyday emotional situations in textual form and instructed participants to either decrease negative emotions by generating different reappraisals (reappraisal-trials) or react naturally (control-trials) to the situations. After each trial, participants indicated their affective state (SAM) and typed in their reappraisal thoughts. Within-subjects analyses showed significantly less negative affect and arousal in reappraisal-trials compared to control-trials, indicating a successful emotion regulation through reappraisal. Contrary to our hypothesis, reappraisal inventiveness and reappraisal effectiveness were not related.

Contextual recruitment of cognitive control in preadolescent children and young adults,"Surrey, C.; Kretschmer-Trendowicz, A.; Altgassen, M.; Fischer, R.","The ability to use contextual cues to adjust cognitive control according to situational demands is a hallmark of flexible and adaptive behavior. We investigated the development of three different types of contextual control recruitment in children (9- and 12-year-olds) and young adults. First, we implemented a list-wide proportion congruence manipulation in which conflict trials were frequently/infrequently presented within a list of trials. Second, we implemented a location-specific proportion congruence manipulation in which conflict trials were frequently/infrequently presented at one of two locations. Both types of contextual control recruitment are based on the formation of high-level associations between context features (lists and locations) and the respective cognitive control set. Contextual recruitment of control is observed in reduced interference at contexts with high conflict frequencies. Finally, we investigated a trial-by-trial, conflict-triggered recruitment of cognitive control. Here, the experience of a conflict in the previous trial is expected to reduce subsequent conflict. In all three forms of control recruitment, distinct contextual cues reveal information about the required extent of cognitive control. Young adults showed reliable adjustments of control for all types of contextual cues. Children were able to demonstrate contextual control recruitment based on stable context-control associations (lists and locations). However, using single conflict signals turned out to challenge children in that they were able to adapt control resources only for error reduction, not for reaction times. Altogether, the results indicated that children can learn and use high-level associations between context and control sets. Implications regarding proactive and reactive mechanisms of cognitive control are discussed.",2019,Jul,J Exp Child Psychol,183,,189-207,30904826.0,10.1016/j.jecp.2019.02.002,,#1833,Surrey 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Modality of fear cues affects acoustic startle potentiation but not heart-rate response in patients with dental phobia,"Wannemuller, A.; Sartory, G.; Elsesser, K.; Lohrmann, T.; Johren, H. P.","The acoustic startle response (SR) has consistently been shown to be enhanced by fear-arousing cross-modal background stimuli in phobics. Intra-modal fear-potentiation of acoustic SR was rarely investigated and generated inconsistent results. The present study compared the acoustic SR to phobia-related sounds with that to phobia-related pictures in 104 dental phobic patients and 22 controls. Acoustic background stimuli were dental treatment noises and birdsong and visual stimuli were dental treatment and neutral control pictures. Background stimuli were presented for 4 s, randomly followed by the administration of the startle stimulus. In addition to SR, heart-rate (HR) was recorded throughout the trials. Irrespective of their content, background pictures elicited greater SR than noises in both groups with a trend for phobic participants to show startle potentiation to phobia-related pictures but not noises. Unlike controls, phobics showed HR acceleration to both dental pictures and noises. HR acceleration of the phobia group was significantly positively correlated with SR in the noise condition only. The acoustic SR to phobia-related noises is likely to be inhibited by prolonged sensorimotor gating.",2015,2015/02/27,Front Psychol,6,,170,25774142.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00170,,#1834,Wannemuller 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Corporal punishment and children's externalizing problems: a cross-sectional study of Tanzanian primary school aged children,"Hecker, T.; Hermenau, K.; Isele, D.; Elbert, T.","The adverse effect of harsh corporal punishment on mental health and psychosocial functioning in children has been repeatedly suggested by studies in industrialized countries. Nevertheless, corporal punishment has remained common practice not only in many homes, but is also regularly practiced in schools, particularly in low-income countries, as a measure to maintain discipline. Proponents of corporal punishment have argued that the differences in culture and industrial development might also be reflected in a positive relationship between the use of corporal punishment and improving behavioral problems in low-income nations. In the present study we assessed the occurrence of corporal punishment at home and in school in Tanzanian primary school students. We also examined the association between corporal punishment and externalizing problems. The 409 children (52% boys) from grade 2 to 7 had a mean age of 10.49 (SD=1.89) years. Nearly all children had experienced corporal punishment at some point during their lifetime both in family and school contexts. Half of the respondents reported having experienced corporal punishment within the last year from a family member. A multiple sequential regression analysis revealed that corporal punishment by parents or by caregivers was positively related to children's externalizing problems. The present study provides evidence that Tanzanian children of primary school age are frequently exposed to extreme levels of corporal punishment, with detrimental consequences for externalizing behavior. Our findings emphasize the need to inform parents, teachers and governmental organizations, especially in low-income countries, about the adverse consequences of using corporal punishment be it at home or at school.",2014,May,Child Abuse Negl,38,5,884-92,24360761.0,10.1016/j.chiabu.2013.11.007,,#1835,Hecker 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

A.; Adolph, D.; Margraf, J.","The agreement of subjective and genital sexual response, also referred to as sexual concordance, shows substantial variability between women. Identifying predictors of sexual arousal and sexual concordance is important to improve our understanding of female sexual response and its relationship to sexual function or dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess the relevance of sexual excitation and sexual inhibition as predictors of subjective sexual arousal, genital arousal, and sexual concordance. In a laboratory setting, sexual arousal was induced by erotic video stimuli. Subjective sexual arousal was assessed continuously during stimulus presentation and genital arousal was measured with vaginal photoplethysmography. Data of 58 women (M age = 24.95, SD = 4.65) were analyzed using multilevel analyses (HLM). This data analytic technique estimates the within-subject associations of subjective and genital arousal, by controlling for between-subject differences. An interaction term of sexual excitation and sexual inhibition significantly predicted genital sexual arousal. In exploratory analyses, two lower order factors of sexual inhibition (Concerns about Sexual Function and Arousal Contingency) were predictive of sexual concordance. Further examination of these associations might increase our knowledge of female sexual function and deepen our understanding of how sexual excitation and sexual inhibition affect sexual arousal and consequently, impact sexual behaviors, in women.",2016,Nov,Arch Sex Behav,45,8,1957-1971,27379408.0,10.1007/s10508-016-0774-7,,#1836,Velten 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

The intervention comprised ten 15-minute sessions over a 5-week course. At baseline, participants showed approach and attentional biases towards high-caloric palatable food that were both significantly reduced and turned into avoidance biases after the training. Participants also reported pronounced reductions in both trait and cue-elicited food craving and in ED symptoms as well. The overall evaluation of the training by the participants was positive.

Both acAN and recAN showed lower levels of self-esteem as compared with healthy controls but did not differ from each other. In acAN, decreased body weight was associated with increased self-esteem. Satisfaction of an achievement motive but not satisfaction of a superiority motive mediated this association. No such correlations could be observed in the other groups. This is the first study to show an often assumed association between decreased body weight and increased self-esteem in AN patients. These preliminary results strengthen the assumption that low body weight may foster self-esteem in patients with acAN, mainly through the satisfaction of an achievement motive. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Self-esteem should be focused very early in the treatment of AN since weight gain may deprive the patient of an important source of self-esteem. Treatment interventions should be attuned to underlying motives of threatened self-esteem; in AN patients, the enhancement of self-esteem via weight loss seems to be rather fuelled by the satisfaction of an achievement motive than by the satisfaction of a superiority motive. Specific trainings to improve self-esteem in AN patients seem to be promising as an add-on to regular treatment.",2013,Sep-Oct,Clin Psychol Psychother,20,5,394-400,22311699.0,10.1002/cpp.1771,,#1838,Brockmeyer 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

The model suggested between 97 and 486 sexual contacts per German individual during a sexually active lifetime based on the annual HIV incidence of 680 among the heterosexual population reported by the German National Health Authority. This is in line with the estimated 296 sexual contacts during one's lifetime, which was indicated by questionnaire respondents. The model confirms the correspondence of self-reported sexual activity with HIV incidence as reported by the German National Health Authority. Accordingly, HIV incidence- and prevalence-based modeling of sexual activity in a population provides crude estimations in situations where a range of uncertainty is acceptable.

We collected data for 26 matched outpatients at pre- and posttreatment, as well as at 1-year follow-up. Outcome measures were the days of incapacity to work (DIW) as well as self-report measures (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Symptom Checklist 90-R [GSI], Life Satisfaction Questionnaire [FLZ]). We analyzed data with hierarchical linear modeling in a 2-level model. Therapy effects were defined in 3 ways: effect size (ES), response (based on the reliable change index), and remission compared with the general population's symptom level. The DIW were reduced significantly after both types of treatment, but employees showed even fewer DIW after W-CBT. At follow-up, significantly more employees were working as a result of W-CBT than with CBT-AU. Significant improvements on scores of self-rating measures corresponded with moderate-to-large effect sizes for both treatment types. Approximately 2 thirds of the treated employees were categorized as unimpaired on BDI scores at posttreatment and at follow-up. At least 1 half of the employees were classified as unimpaired on GSI scores at both assessment points.

Over the course of 3 years, participants reported on average a slight improvement of physical quality of life. Physical health was mainly predicted by mobility and level of burn severity. Variance in mental health status was mainly predicted by gender, mobility, neuroticism, level of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related avoidance.

Furthermore, the study sought to examine illness behavior as a possible pathway through which expectations may affect postoperative well-being. Seventy patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were examined one day before surgery, ~7-10 days after surgery, and six months after surgery. Regression analyses indicated that disability at follow-up (primary outcome) was significantly predicted by postoperative (beta = -.342, p = .008), but not by preoperative expectations (beta = -.213, p = .069). Similar results were found for the secondary outcomes, i.e. quality of life and depressive symptoms. A bootstrapped mediation analysis showed that although both postoperative expectations and illness behavior had significant unique effects on disability, there was no significant mediation effect. While previous studies have mainly focused on patients' preoperative expectations, the present is the first to emphasize the predictive value of patients' expectations a few days after surgery, pointing to the potential of interventions targeting postoperative expectations.

The influence of frontal alpha-asymmetry on the processing of approach- and withdrawal-related stimuli-A multichannel psychophysiology study,"Adolph, D.; von Glischinski, M.; Wannemuller, A.; Margraf, J.","The approach-withdrawal model of hemispheric activation suggests that left frontal cortical areas mediate approach, while right frontal cortical areas mediate withdrawal motivation. Within this framework, the present study investigates the association of frontal cortical asymmetry with attentional and emotional responses toward approach- and withdrawal-related emotional stimuli. Resting frontal asymmetry was measured from 43 students before they passively viewed negative, neutral, and positive emotional pictures. The startle reflex, skin conductance response, and subjective ratings of valence and arousal were assessed to quantify emotional responding, while attention was assessed with ERPs. We also assessed frontal asymmetry in response to the pictures. Results indicated that relatively stronger right frontal cortical activation was associated with increased N1 amplitudes and more negative subjective emotional evaluation of all stimuli. Furthermore, enhanced right frontal asymmetry (state and trait) was associated with diminished emotional modulation of the late positive potential. In contrast, no association of frontal asymmetry with defensive reflex physiology or activation of sympathetic nervous system activity was found. The current data suggest dissociable influence of resting frontal brain asymmetry on attentional and physiological processing of withdrawal- and approach-related stimuli. That is, asymmetrical frontal cortical brain activation might not modulate approach-/withdrawal-related motor responses and sympathetic arousal directly, but instead enhances allocation of attentional resources to subjectively significant stimuli. The results are discussed in terms of their potential importance for emotion perception in anxiety disorders and their contribution to the understanding of frontal asymmetry.",2017,Sep,Psychophysiology,54,9,1295-1310,28444963.0,10.1111/psyp.12878,,#1852,Adolph 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"I'd do much better, if only ... counterfactual comparisons related to traumatic life events","Hoppen, T. H.; Morina, N.","The association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and counterfactual comparisons (CFC) is poorly understood and CFC-measures are missing. We developed and applied the Posttraumatic Counterfactual Comparisons Scale (P-CFC-S), which measures frequency, intensity and affective impact of trauma-related CFC. We further measured trauma history, PTSD symptoms, probable PTSD diagnosis, posttraumatic cognitions, satisfaction with life and basic sociodemographic information. The sample consisted of 556 adults (62.95% female) who had all experienced at least one potentially traumatic event and of whom 15.29% fulfilled a probable PTSD diagnosis. The P-CFC-S yielded adequate internal consistency and a one-factor structure in the explorative factor analysis. CFC were common, and about two-fold more common in individuals with probable PTSD compared to those without. In hierarchical regression analyses, the frequency and intensity in CFC explained a significant amount of variance in PTSD symptoms when potentially confounding variables (i.e. age, gender, posttraumatic cognitions and counterfactual thinking) were accounted for. Our findings suggest that CFC may be an active ingredient in PTSD maintenance.

[Inpatient Psychodynamic Therapy for Children and Adolescents with Complex ADHD: Results of a Naturalistic Clinical Trial],"Cropp, C.; Kuchinke, L.; Streeck-Fischer, A.","The Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common mental disorder in childhood and adolescence. However, it is a very heterogeneous disorder with subgroups of patients with mild symptoms and others with severe and complex impairments. Patients suffering from complex ADHD are usually characterized by multiple developmental disorders and impaired personality development. Due to the multimodal origin of the disorder, multimodal treatment approaches aimed at reducing the various deficits are usually indicated. The current study evaluated a multimodal inpatient psychodynamic treatment (PDT) for children and adolescents suffering from ADHD. 47 patients (age 9-17 years) were included in the study. Next to complex impairments (comorbid mental disorders, deficits regarding psychic structure, learning disorders and sensorimotor integration disorders), a high number of adverse childhood experiences (M = 11.71) was particularly remarkable in the sample. The PDT led to significant improvements regarding ADHD symptoms and general level of functioning. However, first symptom improvements were already evident at the end of the waiting period. For ten patients who participated in the follow-up assessment effects remained stable six months after treatment. Due to the high drop-out rate, however, the study results have to be regarded as preliminary.",2021,Sep,Prax Kinderpsychol Kinderpsychiatr,70,6,520-540,34519618.0,10.13109/prkk.2021.70.6.520,,#1855,Cropp 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Maternal transmission of borderline personality disorder symptoms in the community-based Greifswald Family Study,"Barnow, S.; Aldinger, M.; Arens, E. A.; Ulrich, I.; Spitzer, C.; Grabe, H.

The sample consisted of 323 offspring and their mothers from the community-based Greifswald Family Study. These families were examined for the first time when the children were about 15 years old (T(0)), and again 5 years later (T(1)), using self-ratings and interviews. Regression analyses revealed that maternal BPD symptoms and depression at T(0) were significant predictors of a number of BPD criteria that offspring met at T(1). Furthermore, the analyses also predicted offspring's general psychopathology.

Emotional inertia contributes to depressive symptoms beyond perseverative thinking,"Brose, A.; Schmiedek, F.; Koval, P.; Kuppens, P.","The autocorrelation or inertia of negative affect reflects how much negative emotions carry over from moment to moment and has been associated with increased depressive symptoms. In this study, we posed three challenges to this association by examining: (1) whether emotional inertia is relevant for depressive symptoms when assessed on a longer timescale than usual; (2) whether inertia is uniquely related to depressive symptoms after controlling for perseverative thoughts; and (3) whether inertia is related to depressive symptoms over and above the within-person association between affect and perseverative thoughts. Participants (N = 101) provided ratings of affect and perseverative thoughts for 100 days; depressive symptoms were reported before and after the study, and again after 2.5 years. Day-to-day emotional inertia was related to depressive symptoms over and above trait and state perseverative thoughts. Moreover, inertia predicted depressive symptoms when adjusting for its association with perseverative thoughts.

Redundant encoding strengthens segmentation and grouping in visual displays of data,"Nothelfer, C.; Gleicher, M.; Franconeri, S.","The availability and importance of data are accelerating, and our visual system is a critical tool for understanding it. The research field of data visualization seeks design guidelines-often inspired by perceptual psychology-for more efficient visual data analysis. We evaluated a common guideline: When presenting multiple sets of values to a viewer, those sets should be distinguished not just by a single feature, such as color, but redundantly by multiple features, such as color and shape. Despite the broad use of this practice across maps and graphs, it may carry costs, and there is no direct evidence for a benefit. We show that this practice can indeed yield a large benefit for rapidly segmenting objects within a dense display (Experiments 1 and 2), and strengthening visual grouping of display elements (Experiment 3). We predict situations where this benefit might be present, and discuss implications for models of attentional control.

However, few studies used routinely available sociodemographic and clinical data for this task, and many previous investigations used highly selected samples. This study aimed to investigate cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) outcomes in a large, naturalistic and longitudinal dataset. Routine data from a university-based outpatient center with n = 2.147 patients was analyzed. Only baseline data including sociodemographics, symptom measures and functional impairment ratings was used for prediction. Different competing classification and regression models were compared to each other; the best models were then applied to previously unseen validation data. Applied on the validation set, the best performing classification model for remission achieved a balanced accuracy of 59% (p < 0.001) and the best performing regression model for dimensional change achieved r = 0.27 (p < 0.001). Age, sex, functional impairment, symptom severity, and axis II comorbidity were among the most important features.

Hence, this aspect was examined as part of a randomized controlled clinical trial realized at Asklepios Fachklinikum Tiefenbrunn. Here, the OPD-CA axis structure has been applied to assess the structural level of 42 adolescent patients (15-19 years). In contrast to previous studies, the assessment was not carried out by independent raters using a videotaped OPD-CA interview, but the rating was part of clinical routine procedures.

Giving G a Meaning: An Application of the Bifactor-(S-1) Approach to Realize a More Symptom-Oriented Modeling of the Beck Depression Inventory-II,"Heinrich, M.; Zagorscak, P.; Eid, M.; Knaevelsrud, C.","The Beck Depression Inventory-II is one of the most frequently used scales to assess depressive burden. Despite many psychometric evaluations, its factor structure is still a topic of debate. An increasing number of articles using fully symmetrical bifactor models have been published recently. However, they all produce anomalous results, which lead to psychometric and interpretational difficulties. To avoid anomalous results, the bifactor-(S-1) approach has recently been proposed as alternative for fitting bifactor structures. The current article compares the applicability of fully symmetrical bifactor models and symptom-oriented bifactor-(S-1) and first-order confirmatory factor analysis models in a large clinical sample (N = 3,279) of adults. The results suggest that bifactor-(S-1) models are preferable when bifactor structures are of interest, since they reduce problematic results observed in fully symmetrical bifactor models and give the G factor an unambiguous meaning.

A number of studies, mostly based on analogue samples, have provided initial support for the BADS. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties of the German version of the scale more broadly, including change sensitivity and clinical treatment data. A mixed sample of students (N = 312) and depressed outpatients in partial remission undergoing cognitive-behavioural group treatment for depressive rumination (N = 59) was examined. To analyze construct validity, a set of theoretically relevant constructs such as perseverative thinking, distraction and mindfulness was also assessed.

Interactive effects of citalopram and serotonin transporter genotype on neural correlates of response inhibition and attentional orienting,"Fischer, A. G.; Endrass, T.; Goebel, I.; Reuter, M.; Montag, C.; Kubisch, C.; Ullsperger, M.","The brain's serotonergic (5-HT) system has been implicated in controlling impulsive behavior and attentional orienting and linked to impulse control and anxiety related disorders. However, interactions between genotypical variation and responses to serotonergic drugs impede both treatment efficacy and neuroscientific research. We examine behavioral and electrophysiological responses to acute intravenous administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) while controlling for major genetic differences regarding 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) genotypes. Out of a genotyped sample of healthy Caucasian subjects (n=878) two extreme-groups regarding 5-HTT genotypes were selected (n=32). A homozygous high-expressing group based on tri-allelic 5-HTTLPR and rs25532 (LAC/LAC=LL) was compared to homozygous S allele carriers (SS). Both groups were administered a low dose of citalopram (10mg) intravenously in a double blind crossover fashion and performed a novelty NoGo paradigm while high density EEG was recorded. Interactions between drug and genotype were seen on both behavioral and neurophysiological levels. Reaction slowing following inhibitory events was decreased by the administration of citalopram in the LL but not SS group. This was accompanied by decreases in the amplitude of the inhibitory N2 EEG component and the P3b in the LL group, which was not seen in the SS group. SS subjects showed an increase in P3a amplitudes following SSRI administration to any type of deviant stimulus possibly reflecting increased attentional capture. The acute SSRI response on inhibitory processes and attentional orienting interacts with genotypes regulating 5-HTT gene expression. SS subjects may show increased attentional side effects reflected in increases in P3a amplitudes which could contribute to treatment discontinuation. Inhibitory processes and their neural correlates are affected only in LL subjects. These findings may indicate an underlying mechanism that could relate genotypical differences to altered side effect profiles and drug responses and are compatible with a non-monotonic relationship between 5-HT levels and optimal functioning.",2015,Aug 1,NeuroImage,116,,59-67,25957993.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.04.064,,#1863,Fischer 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Acceptance of tinnitus: validation of the tinnitus acceptance questionnaire,"Weise, C.; Kleinstauber, M.; Hesser, H.; Westin, V. Z.; Andersson, G.","The concept of acceptance has recently received growing attention within tinnitus research due to the fact that tinnitus acceptance is one of the major targets of psychotherapeutic treatments. Accordingly, acceptance-based treatments will most likely be increasingly offered to tinnitus patients and assessments of acceptance-related behaviours will thus be needed. The current study investigated the factorial structure of the Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire (TAQ) and the role of tinnitus acceptance as mediating link between sound perception (i.e. subjective loudness of tinnitus) and tinnitus distress. In total, 424 patients with chronic tinnitus completed the TAQ and validated measures of tinnitus distress, anxiety, and depression online. Confirmatory factor analysis provided support to a good fit of the data to the hypothesised bifactor model (root-mean-square-error of approximation = .065; Comparative Fit Index = .974; Tucker-Lewis Index = .958; standardised root mean square residual = .032). In addition, mediation analysis, using a non-parametric joint coefficient approach, revealed that tinnitus-specific acceptance partially mediated the relation between subjective tinnitus loudness and tinnitus distress (path ab = 5.96; 95% CI: 4.49, 7.69). In a multiple mediator model, tinnitus acceptance had a significantly stronger indirect effect than anxiety. The results confirm the factorial structure of the TAQ and suggest the importance of a general acceptance factor that contributes important unique variance beyond that of the first-order factors activity engagement and tinnitus suppression. Tinnitus acceptance as measured with the TAQ is proposed to be a key construct in tinnitus research and should be further implemented into treatment concepts to reduce tinnitus distress.",2013,2013/06,Cogn Behav Ther,42,2,100-15,23627873.0,10.1080/16506073.2013.781670,,#1867,Weise 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

We used a robust emotional face-matching task and acquired high-resolution structural images for morphometric analyses using voxel-based morphometry. The main results were positive associations of separation anxiety scores with amygdala reactivity to emotional faces as well as increased amygdala grey matter volumes. A functional connectivity analysis revealed positive associations between separation anxiety and functional coupling of the amygdala with areas involved in visual processes and attention, including several occipital and somatosensory areas.

The cortisol awakening response in infants: ontogeny and associations with development-related variables,"Stalder, T.; Baumler, D.; Miller, R.; Alexander, N.; Kliegel, M.; Kirschbaum, C.","The cortisol awakening response (CAR) is a frequently used measure in psychoneuroendocrinological research, however, some of its more fundamental aspects still require attention. An important question in this respect concerns the ontogeny of the CAR. Data from two recent reports suggest that the CAR may only emerge relatively late during child development (>/=16 months of age). However, as both enquiries did not use objective means of verifying participant adherence or infants' awakening times, it is unclear whether methodological factors may have contributed to these results. Here, we report data from a study on 33 infants aged 2-12 months with close care being taken to ensure the accuracy of sampling times by using wrist actigraphy and electronic monitoring containers. Salivary cortisol levels were assessed at 0 and 30 min post-awakening over three study days. Results revealed evidence for a significant CAR (>/=2.5 nmol/L) in 32 (out of 33) infants and on a total 86.9% of study days, with a marked magnitude of the CAR across infants (mean estimated increase=12.54 nmol/L). In addition, the cortisol level on awakening and the CAR were found to be associated with different aspects of infant's physical and sleep-related development as well as with their weight and body mass index (BMI) at birth. Contrary to previous reports, the current results thus indicate that the ontogeny of the CAR occurs at an early stage of development and that it is present from as early as two months of life. The data also suggest that post-awakening cortisol secretion may undergo considerable changes during the first year of life associated with different aspects of infant development.",2013,Apr,Psychoneuroendocrinology,38,4,552-9,22920911.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.07.015,,#1869,Stalder 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Mental Health and Loneliness in University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: A Longitudinal Study,"Weber, M.; Schulze, L.; Bolzenkotter, T.; Niemeyer, H.; Renneberg, B.","The COVID-19 pandemic and its preventive measures had adverse consequences for mental health. However, knowledge of mental health trajectories across the pandemic is limited. This study investigated the mental health levels and changes among university students during the pandemic and lockdown in Germany, as well as their associated factors. We surveyed students' mental health (N = 363, 68% female) with the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-8) and the generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) during the first easing phase (July 2020; time 1) and the second lockdown (November 2020; time 2). Cut-off scores from the GAD-7 and PHQ-8 were used to determine clinically relevant symptoms and to define trajectory groups. Sociodemographic and pandemic-related data were assessed (e.g., coping with academic life, social contacts) as well as loneliness, stress, repetitive negative thinking, quality of life, and perceived social support. Paired t-test, multiple regression, and repeated-measures ANOVA were applied. Means and prevalence rates for symptoms of depression (38.8%) and anxiety (25.6%) did not differ between time 1 and time 2, and most students were asymptomatic on the PHQ-8 (44.4%) and the GAD-7 (56.3%) across the pandemic. Feelings of loneliness significantly increased from time 1 to time 2, d = -0.30, [-0.47, -0.13], with higher symptom levels in symptomatic groups at time 2 and greater increases in the asymptomatic groups. Levels of stress, repetitive negative thinking, quality of life, and social support did not differ during the pandemic. At time 1, loneliness and repetitive negative thinking were associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Patients in the final sample (n = 47) reported a mild depression and significant increase in unspecific anxiety (d = .41), panic symptoms (d = .85) and specific phobia (d = .38), while social anxiety remained unaltered. Pandemic related stressors like job insecurities, familial stress and working in the health sector were significantly associated with more severe depression and increases in anxiety symptoms.

We investigated whether salivary cortisol level is increased during a lockdown and whether a lockdown condition affects the association between loneliness, specific COVID-19 related stressors and salivary cortisol level. We conducted a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study with 280 participants in Germany who experienced at least mild loneliness and distress amid COVID-19 from August 2020 to March 2021. We measured their momentary loneliness and COVID-related stressors including worries, information seeking behaviors and feelings of restriction during ""no-lockdown"" or ""lockdown"" stages amid COVID-19.

Fear learning and generalization during pandemic fear: How COVID-19-related anxiety affects classical fear conditioning with traumatic film clips,"Hauck, A.; Michael, T.; Ferreira de Sa, D. S.","The COVID-19 pandemic greatly disrupted our daily lives. Worldwide, people were confronted with health, financial, and existential fears or trauma-like experiences. Recent studies have identified an increase in stress, anxiety, and fear symptoms in connection with the pandemic. Furthermore, fear learning processes are central mechanisms in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Patients commonly show impairments not only in fear learning but also in its generalization. Thus, pandemic-related anxiety may constitute a risk factor for both enhanced fear acquisition and generalization. In a pre-registered online study with a final sample of 220 healthy university students, we investigated whether participants with higher COVID-19-related anxiety (COVID-Anxiety) show impaired fear learning and generalization. For this purpose, we used a differential fear conditioning paradigm with a traumatic film clip as the unconditioned stimulus (US) and collected US-expectancy as the main measure of interest. Participants with high COVID-Anxiety show a tendency toward poorer discrimination between the reinforced conditioned stimulus (CS+) and the unreinforced conditioned stimulus (CS-) during acquisition and significantly poorer discrimination patterns during generalization. Furthermore, participants with high COVID-Anxiety show greater general fear throughout the whole experiment. Our results show that the subjective effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being are associated with impairments in both fear learning and fear generalization. As expected, high COVID-Anxiety leads to poorer performance in stimulus discrimination and greater levels of fear, which might contribute to a higher risk of anxiety disorders.

Univariate and multivariate regression was used to examine differences in quality of life between different groups of people during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associations with selected predictors. In summary, women, younger persons and job seekers or those who saw their work hours reduced or who could not pursue their regular jobs presented a lower quality of life in individual areas of life than the respective reference group.

"Perceived vulnerability to disease, knowledge about COVID-19, and changes in preventive behavior during lockdown in a German convenience sample","Stangier, U.; Kananian, S.; Schuller, J.","The COVID-19 pandemic has called worldwide for strong governmental measures to contain its spread, associated with considerable psychological distress. This study aimed at screening a convenience sample in Germany during lockdown for perceived vulnerability to disease, knowledge about COVID-19, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and behavioral responses. In an online survey, 1358 participants completed the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVD), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), and questionnaires on knowledge about COVID-19 and self-perceived change in behaviors in response to COVID-19. Lower and upper quartiles of the PVD were used to classify individuals into low and high PVD. A confirmatory factor analysis supported three factors representing risk, preventive and adaptive behavior as behavioral responses to COVID-19 lockdown. A structural equation model showed that the score of the knowledge scale significantly predicted the self-reported increase in adaptive and preventive behavior. The score in the PVD-subscale Perceived Infectability predicted a self-reported increase in preventive behavior, whereas the Germ Aversion score predicted a self-reported increase in preventive and a decrease in risk behavior. The score in PHQ-4 predicted a higher score in the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales, and a self-reported decrease in adaptive behavior. Low-, medium- and high-PVD groups reported distinct patterns of behavior, knowledge, and mental health symptoms.

To prevent the spread of Sars-CoV-2, governments worldwide have implemented different forms of public health measures ranging from physical distancing recommendations to stay-at-home orders, which have disrupted individuals' everyday life tremendously. However, evidence on the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures with mental health are limited so far. In this study, we investigated the role of sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors for immediate mental health consequences in a nationwide community sample of adults from Germany (N = 4335). Specifically, we examined the effects of different forms and levels of restriction resulting from public health measures (e.g. quarantine, stay-at-home order) on anxiety and depression symptomatology, health anxiety, loneliness, the occurrence of fearful spells, psychosocial distress and life-satisfaction. We found that higher restrictions due to lockdown measures, a greater reduction of social contacts and greater perceived changes in life were associated with higher mental health impairments. Importantly, a subjectively assumed but not an officially announced stay-at-home order was associated with poorer mental health.

To optimize the allocation of health care resources, research on specific vulnerability factors, such as health anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and distress (in)tolerance, and particularly their effect on the time course of SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety appears crucial for supporting high risk groups suffering from elevated mental distress during the pandemic. N = 887 participants (78.4% female; M(age) = 38.15, SD = 17.04) completed an online survey in Germany (April to mid-May 2020), comprising measures of SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety, health anxiety, safety and preventive behavior, intolerance of uncertainty, and distress intolerance. Higher levels of health anxiety pre and during COVID-19 were associated with an initially intensified increase (b = 1.10, p < 0.001), but later on a more rapid dampening (b = -0.18, p < 0.001) of SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety. SARS-CoV-2 related preventive behavior was intensified by both pre (b = 0.06, p = 0.01) and during (b = 0.15, p < 0.001) COVID-19 health anxiety, while reassurance behavior only was associated with health anxiety during COVID-19 (b = 0.14, p < 0.001).

"Effects of adaptive and non-adaptive three-week executive control training on interference control: Evidence from the N2, CRN, and ERN","Grutzmann, R.; Kathmann, N.; Gutmann, G.; Heinzel, S.","The current pilot study investigated if interference control can be improved by a three-week at-home training comprising a flanker and a n-back task in healthy adults, thus exploring the training's suitability for future clinical application, i.e. as a treatment augmentation for psychological disorders. As training gains are assumed to be modulated by the amount of mismatch between task demands and brain resources, an adaptive and a non-adaptive training were contrasted in separate experiments. In the adaptive training, task difficulty was continuously adapted to participants' performance. In the non-adaptive training procedure, task difficulty remained stable on the lowest difficulty level. As deficits in interference control in psychological disorders often predominantly manifest on the electrophysiological level, the impact of the training procedures on medio-frontal negativities (N2, CRN, ERN) was investigated in addition to behavioral measures. The adaptive training led to significant improvements in interference control, as reflected in reduced response times and error rates in incompatible trials. This was accompanied by specific and complementary changes in medio-frontal negativities: After the adaptive training the N2 in incompatible trials was larger and the CRN in incompatible trials was reduced. The non-adaptive training procedure led to generally faster response times but also an increased error rate, indicating a speed-accuracy trade-off. This was accompanied by global changes to medio-frontal negativities irrespective of compatibility, possibly indicating task disengagement.

Patients were treated by postgraduate clinicians at a university outpatient clinic. Psychometric instruments were assessed at intake and therapeutic interventions and skills in the third session were routinely rated by independent observers. After variable preselection, an elastic net algorithm was used to build two dropout prediction models, one including and one excluding observer-rated session variables. The best model included observer-rated variables and was significantly superior to the model including intake variables only. Alongside intake variables, two observer-rated variables significantly predicted dropout: therapist use of feedback and summaries and treatment difficulty. Although not retained in the final prediction model, the observer-rated use of cognitive techniques was also significantly correlated with dropout. Observer ratings of therapist interventions and skills in early sessions of psychotherapy improve predictors of dropout from psychotherapy beyond intake variables alone.

"Delay of Gratification, Delay Discounting and their Associations with Age, Episodic Future Thinking, and Future Time Perspective","Gollner, L. M.; Ballhausen, N.; Kliegel, M.; Forstmeier, S.","The delay of gratification (DoG) in children is widely investigated with an experimental procedure originally called the ""marshmallow test,"" whereas the studies on self-regulation (SR) in adolescents and adults usually use self-report questionnaires. Delay discounting (DD) measures simplify the DoG procedure and focus on monetary rewards. The aim of this study was to investigate age differences in DoG and DD from childhood to old age using a test that is suitable for both children and adults. Furthermore, investigations were conducted on the association between DoG/DD and two future orientation constructs [future time perspective (FTP) and episodic future thinking (EFT)] as well as age differences in these constructs. Participants from five age groups (9-14, 18-25, 35-55, 65-80, 80+) participated in the study (N = 96). While we found no age difference for DoG, DD was the lowest [i.e., self-control (SC) was the highest] in young/middle adults; however, it was the highest (i.e., SC was the lowest) in children and old/oldest adults. Furthermore, we found significant age differences for DD and FTP. As predicted, there were strong correlations between DoG and FTP and between DD and FTP, but not between DoG/DD and EFT. These results indicate that age differences in SR vary across the measures used.

Comparison of fMRI paradigms assessing visuospatial processing: Robustness and reproducibility,"Schuster, V.; Herholz, P.; Zimmermann, K. M.; Westermann, S.; Frassle, S.; Jansen, A.","The development of brain imaging techniques, in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), made it possible to non-invasively study the hemispheric lateralization of cognitive brain functions in large cohorts. Comprehensive models of hemispheric lateralization are, however, still missing and should not only account for the hemispheric specialization of individual brain functions, but also for the interactions among different lateralized cognitive processes (e.g., language and visuospatial processing). This calls for robust and reliable paradigms to study hemispheric lateralization for various cognitive functions. While numerous reliable imaging paradigms have been developed for language, which represents the most prominent left-lateralized brain function, the reliability of imaging paradigms investigating typically right-lateralized brain functions, such as visuospatial processing, has received comparatively less attention. In the present study, we aimed to establish an fMRI paradigm that robustly and reliably identifies right-hemispheric activation evoked by visuospatial processing in individual subjects. In a first study, we therefore compared three frequently used paradigms for assessing visuospatial processing and evaluated their utility to robustly detect right-lateralized brain activity on a single-subject level. In a second study, we then assessed the test-retest reliability of the so-called Landmark task-the paradigm that yielded the most robust results in study 1. At the single-voxel level, we found poor reliability of the brain activation underlying visuospatial attention. This suggests that poor signal-to-noise ratios can become a limiting factor for test-retest reliability. This represents a common detriment of fMRI paradigms investigating visuospatial attention in general and therefore highlights the need for careful considerations of both the possibilities and limitations of the respective fMRI paradigm-in particular, when being interested in effects at the single-voxel level. Notably, however, when focusing on the reliability of measures of hemispheric lateralization (which was the main goal of study 2), we show that hemispheric dominance (quantified by the lateralization index, LI, with |LI| >0.4) of the evoked activation could be robustly determined in more than 62% and, if considering only two categories (i.e., left, right), in more than 93% of our subjects. Furthermore, the reliability of the lateralization strength (LI) was ""fair"" to ""good"". In conclusion, our results suggest that the degree of right-hemispheric dominance during visuospatial processing can be reliably determined using the Landmark task, both at the group and single-subject level, while at the same time stressing the need for future refinements of experimental paradigms and more sophisticated fMRI data acquisition techniques.",2017,2017/10/23,PLOS ONE,12,10,e0186344,29059201.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0186344,,#1886,Schuster 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

An analysis of variance revealed that participants of all subgroups showed an attentive preference for unattractive areas of one's own body. Girls with AN-R attended significantly longer to unattractive body areas than both control groups and significantly shorter to attractive body areas than healthy controls. State body dissatisfaction was more prominent in all eating disorder subgroups, with significantly lower scores in BN compared to AN-R. In general, the higher the state body dissatisfaction, the stronger was the deficit orientation on one's own body.

Phonological working memory and FOXP2,"Schulze, K.; Vargha-Khadem, F.; Mishkin, M.","The discovery and description of the affected members of the KE family (aKE) initiated research on how genes enable the unique human trait of speech and language. Many aspects of this genetic influence on speech-related cognitive mechanisms are still elusive, e.g. if and how cognitive processes not directly involved in speech production are affected. In the current study we investigated the effect of the FOXP2 mutation on Working Memory (WM). Half the members of the multigenerational KE family have an inherited speech-language disorder, characterised as a verbal and orofacial dyspraxia caused by a mutation of the FOXP2 gene. The core phenotype of the affected KE members (aKE) is a deficiency in repeating words, especially complex non-words, and in coordinating oromotor sequences generally. Execution of oromotor sequences and repetition of phonological sequences both require WM, but to date the aKE's memory ability in this domain has not been examined in detail. To do so we used a test series based on the Baddeley and Hitch WM model, which posits that the central executive (CE), important for planning and manipulating information, works in conjunction with two modality-specific components: The phonological loop (PL), specialized for processing speech-based information; and the visuospatial sketchpad (VSSP), dedicated to processing visual and spatial information. We compared WM performance related to CE, PL, and VSSP function in five aKE and 15 healthy controls (including three unaffected members of the KE family who do not have the FOXP2 mutation). The aKE scored significantly below this control group on the PL component, but not on the VSSP or CE components. Further, the aKE were impaired relative to the controls not only in motor (i.e. articulatory) output but also on the recognition-based PL subtest (word-list matching), which does not require speech production. These results suggest that the aKE's impaired phonological WM may be due to a defect in subvocal rehearsal of speech-based material, and that this defect may be due in turn to compromised speech-based representations.",2018,Jan 8,Neuropsychologia,108,,147-152,29174050.0,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.11.027,,#1890,Schulze 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
How the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Controls Affective Processing in Absence of Visual Awareness - Insights From a Combined EEG-rTMS Study,"Keuper, K.; Terrighena, E. L.; Chan, C. C. H.; Junghoefer, M.; Lee, T. M. C.","The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a key role in the modulation of affective processing. However, its specific role in the regulation of neurocognitive processes underlying the interplay of affective perception and visual awareness has remained largely unclear. Using a mixed factorial design, this study investigated effects of inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) of the right DLPFC (rDLPFC) compared to an Active Control condition on behavioral (N = 48) and electroencephalographic (N = 38) correlates of affective processing in healthy Chinese participants. Event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to passively viewed subliminal and supraliminal negative and neutral natural scenes were recorded before and after cTBS application. We applied minimum-norm approaches to estimate the corresponding neuronal sources. On a behavioral level, we found evidence for reduced emotional interference by, and less negative and aroused ratings of negative supraliminal stimuli following rDLPFC inhibition. We found no evidence for stimulation effects on self-reported mood or the behavioral discrimination of subliminal stimuli. On a neurophysiological level, rDLPFC inhibition relatively enhanced occipito-parietal brain activity for both subliminal and supraliminal negative compared to neutral images (112-268 ms; 320-380 ms). The early onset and localization of these effects suggests that rDLPFC inhibition boosts automatic processes of ""emotional attention"" independently of visual awareness. Further, our study reveals the first available evidence for a differential influence of rDLPFC inhibition on subliminal versus supraliminal neural emotion processing. Explicitly, our findings indicate that rDLPFC inhibition selectively enhances late (292-360 ms) activity in response to supraliminal negative images. We tentatively suggest that this differential frontal activity likely reflects enhanced awareness-dependent down-regulation of negative scene processing, eventually leading to facilitated disengagement from and less negative and aroused evaluations of negative supraliminal stimuli.",2018,2018/10/16,Front Hum Neurosci,12,,412,30386222.0,10.3389/fnhum.2018.00412,,#1891,Keuper 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Temporal Stability of Sexual Excitation and Sexual Inhibition in Women,"Velten, J.; Zahler, L.; Scholten, S.; Margraf, J.","The dual control model of sexual response proposes two factors, sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI), that aim to predict sexual behavior and response. While SE and SI are described as stable traits that influence sexuality-related outcomes such as sexual function or sexual risk taking, only a few studies have presented data on the stability of these factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the temporal stability of SE and SI, and to investigate whether changes in sexual function or partnership status influence SE and SI in a longitudinal sample of women. To address these research questions, the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women (SESII-W) was administered five times over the course of 4 years. The SESII-W includes two main scales of SE and SI which consist of five (Arousability, Partner characteristics, Sexual power dynamics, Smell, and Setting) and three subscales (Concerns about sexual function, Arousal contingency, Relationship importance), respectively. Data from 553 women (M(age) = 31.38 years, SD = 10.25, range = 18-67) who participated in at least two assessment points were included in this study. Bivariate correlations between baseline and the fifth follow-up assessment indicated a high temporal stability of SE and SI in women (.47 < r < .71). A series of generalized linear models were conducted to investigate the impact of time, changes in sexual function, partnership status, and changes in partnership status on SE and SI. Partner characteristics (SE) that showed small increases over time. Across different subscales, improvements in sexual function were associated with higher SE and lower SI. Changes in partnership status and partnership status itself were predictors of one SE- and three SI-related scales.

Is the relation between early post-session reports and treatment outcome an epiphenomenon of intake distress and early response? A multi-predictor analysis in outpatient psychotherapy,"Fluckiger, C.; Grosse Holtforth, M.; Znoj, H. J.; Caspar, F.; Wampold, B. E.","The early phase of psychotherapy has been regarded as a sensitive period in the unfolding of psychotherapy leading to positive outcomes. However, there is disagreement about the degree to which early (especially relationship-related) session experiences predict outcome over and above initial levels of distress and early response to treatment. The goal of the present study was to simultaneously examine outcome at post treatment as a function of (a) intake symptom and interpersonal distress as well as early change in well-being and symptoms, (b) the patient's early session-experiences, (c) the therapist's early session-experiences/interventions, and (d) their interactions. The data of 430 psychotherapy completers treated by 151 therapists were analyzed using hierarchical linear models. Results indicate that early positive intra- and interpersonal session experiences as reported by patients and therapists after the sessions explained 58% of variance of a composite outcome measure, taking intake distress and early response into account. All predictors (other than problem-activating therapists' interventions) contributed to later treatment outcomes if entered as single predictors. However, the multi-predictor analyses indicated that interpersonal distress at intake as well as the early interpersonal session experiences by patients and therapists remained robust predictors of outcome.

The time course of pupil dilation evoked by visual sexual stimuli: Exploring the underlying ANS mechanisms,"Finke, J. B.; Deuter, C. E.; Hengesch, X.; Schachinger, H.","The early processing of visual sexual stimuli shows signs of automaticity. Moreover, there is evidence for sex-specific patterns in cognitive and physiological responding to erotica. However, little is known about the time course of rapid pupillary responses to sexual stimuli and their correspondence with other measures of autonomic activity in women and men. To study pupil dilation as an implicit measure of sexual arousal at various stages of picture processing, we presented 35 heterosexual participants with pictures showing either erotic couples or single (male/female) erotic nudes, contrasted with people involved in everyday situations. Brightness-adjusted grayscale pictures were shown for a duration of 2,500 ms within the central visual field, alternating with perceptually matched patches. Left pupil diameter was recorded at 500 Hz using a video-based eye tracker. Skin conductance and heart rate were coregistered and correlated with latent components of pupil dilation (dissociated by temporal PCA). Whereas stimulus-evoked changes in pupil size indicated virtually no initial constriction, a rapid effect of appetence emerged (dilation to erotica within 500 ms). Responses at early stages of processing were remarkably consistent across both sexes. In contrast, later phases of pupil dilation, subjective ratings, and skin conductance responses showed a sex-specific pattern. Moreover, evidence for an association of early-onset pupil dilation and heart rate acceleration was found, suggestive of parasympathetic inhibition, whereas the late component was mainly related to sympathetically mediated skin conductance. Taken together, our results indicate that different temporal components of pupil responses to erotic stimuli may reflect divergent underlying neural mechanisms.",2017,Oct,Psychophysiology,54,10,1444-1458,28560724.0,10.1111/psyp.12901,,#1894,Finke 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Endocannabinoid concentrations in hair are associated with PTSD symptom severity,"Wilker, S.; Pfeiffer, A.; Elbert, T.; Ovuga, E.; Karabatsiakis, A.; Krumbholz, A.; Thieme, D.; Schelling, G.; Kolassa, I. T.","The endocannabinoid system has been implicated in the regulation of the stress response, fear memory formation, and inflammatory processes. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can result from exposure to extreme stress and is characterized by strong, associative memories for the traumatic events experienced. Furthermore, an elevated physical disease risk has been observed in PTSD, likely to be mediated by inflammatory processes. Therefore, altered endocannabinoid regulation can be expected in individuals with PTSD. However, attempts to assess PTSD-associated differences in the endocannabinoid system from human blood samples have provided inconsistent results, possibly due to fluctuating levels of endocannabinoids. In hair, these neuromodulators are accumulated over time and thus give access to a more stable and reliable assessment. We therefore investigated PTSD-associated differences in hair concentrations of endocannabinoids (N-acyl-ethanolamides palmitoylethanolamide [PEA], oleoylethanolamide [OEA] and stearoylethanolamide [SEA]) in 38 rebel war survivors from Northern Uganda suffering from PTSD and N=38 healthy rebel war survivors without current and lifetime PTSD. PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity were assessed in structured clinical interviews employing the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS). A significant group difference was observed for OEA, with PTSD patients showing reduced hair concentrations. Regression analyses further revealed strong negative relationships between all investigated N-acyl-ethanolamides and symptom severity of PTSD. The observed reductions in endocannabinoids might account for the increased inflammatory state as well as for the failure to extinguish fear memories observed in PTSD. Our findings add to the accumulating evidence suggesting the endocannabinoid system as a target for pharmacological enhancement of exposure-based psychotherapy for PTSD.",2016,May,Psychoneuroendocrinology,67,,198-206,26923850.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.02.010,,#1895,Wilker 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Associations of neural error-processing with symptoms and traits in a dimensional sample recruited across the obsessive-compulsive spectrum,"Riesel, A.; Harpfer, K.; Thoma, L.; Kathmann, N.; Klawohn, J.","The error-related negativity (ERN), a neural response to errors, has been associated with several forms of psychopathology and assumed to represent a neural risk marker for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety disorders. Yet, it is still unknown which specific symptoms or traits best explain ERN variation. This study investigated performance-monitoring in participants (N = 100) recruited across a spectrum of obsessive-compulsive characteristics (n = 26 patients with OCD; n = 74 healthy participants including n = 24 with low, n = 24 with medium, and n = 26 with high OC-characteristics). Several compulsivity- and anxiety-associated characteristics were assessed and submitted to exploratory principal axis factor analysis. Associations of raw measures and derived factors with ERN and correct-related negativity (CRN) were examined. Patients with OCD showed increased ERN amplitudes compared to healthy participants. The ERN was associated with a variety of traits related to anxiety and negative affect. Factor analysis results revealed a most prominent association of the ERN with a composite measure of anxiety and neuroticism, whereas the CRN was specifically associated with compulsivity. Results support differential associations for the ERN and CRN and demonstrate that a dimensional recruitment approach and use of composite measures can improve our understanding of characteristics underlying variation in neural performance monitoring.",2023,Feb,Psychophysiology,60,2,e14164,36030541.0,10.1111/psyp.14164,,#1896,Riesel 2023,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Assessing treatment integrity in cognitive-behavioral therapy: comparing session segments with entire sessions,"Weck, F.; Grikscheit, F.; Hofling, V.; Stangier, U.","The evaluation of treatment integrity (therapist adherence and competence) is a necessary condition to ensure the internal and external validity of psychotherapy research. However, the evaluation process is associated with high costs, because therapy sessions must be rated by experienced clinicians. It is debatable whether rating session segments is an adequate alternative to rating entire sessions. Four judges evaluated treatment integrity (i.e., therapist adherence and competence) in 84 randomly selected videotapes of cognitive-behavioral therapy for major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and hypochondriasis (from three different treatment outcome studies). In each case, two judges provided ratings based on entire therapy sessions and two on session segments only (i.e., the middle third of the entire sessions). Interrater reliability of adherence and competence evaluations proved satisfactory for ratings based on segments and the level of reliability did not differ from ratings based on entire sessions. Ratings of treatment integrity that were based on entire sessions and session segments were strongly correlated (r=.62 for adherence and r=.73 for competence). The relationship between treatment integrity and outcome was comparable for ratings based on session segments and those based on entire sessions. However, significant relationships between therapist competence and therapy outcome were only found in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. Ratings based on segments proved to be adequate for the evaluation of treatment integrity.

Prospective study of nocebo effects related to symptoms of idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF),"Brascher, A. K.; Schulz, S. M.; Van den Bergh, O.; Witthoft, M.","The exact causes of Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance Attributed to Electromagnetic Fields (IEI-EMF, i.e., experience of somatic symptoms attributed to low-level electromagnetic fields) are still unknown. Psychological causation such as nocebo effects seem plausible. This study aimed to experimentally induce a nocebo effect for somatic symptom perception and examined whether it was reproducible after one week. We also examined whether these effects were associated with increased sympathetic activity and whether interoceptive accuracy (IAcc) moderated these relationships. Participants were recruited from the general population and instructed that electromagnetic exposure can enhance somatosensory perception. They participated twice in a cued exposure experiment with tactile stimulation and sham WiFi exposure in 50% of trials. The two sessions were scheduled one week apart (session 1: N = 65, session 2: N = 63). Before session 1, participants watched either a 6-min film on adverse health effects of EMF or a neutral film on trade of mobile phones. IAcc was assessed with the heartbeat detection paradigm. Electrodermal activity served as a measure of sympathetic activation. Evidence for a nocebo effect (i.e., increased self-reported intensity and aversiveness and electrodermal activity) during sham WiFi exposure was observed in both sessions. IAcc moderated the nocebo effect, depending on stimulus intensity. Contrary to previous findings, no difference emerged between the health-related EMF and the neutral films. Based on negative instructions, somatic perception and physiological responding can be altered. This is consistent with the assumption that IEI-EMF could be due to nocebo effects, suggesting an important role for psychological interventions.",2020,Nov,Environ Res,190,,110019,32777274.0,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110019,,#1900,Brascher 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Development and validation of the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms-II-German version,"Wester, R.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a German adaptation of the IDAS-II. Participants from a community sample (N = 1,054) completed the IDAS-II (German version). In addition, part of the sample (N = 550) completed a series of additional measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, WHO-Five Well-Being Index, Symptom Checklist-90 Revised-Short Version) and anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale-5, Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, The International Trauma Questionnaire). We conducted item-level confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) separately for the 15 nonsaturated IDAS-II scales, which confirmed unidimensionality. McDonald's omega indicated good internal consistency (omega > .8) of all symptom scales except Euphoria (omega = .751) and Ordering (omega = .728). A CFA of the IDAS-II scales, based on exploratory results by Watson et al. (2012), confirmed a three-factor model of ""Distress,"" ""Obsessions/Fear,"" and ""Positive Mood."" Correlational analyses with additional symptom measures supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the IDAS-II scales.

Social phobic beliefs mediate the relationship between post-event processing regarding the worst socially aversive experience and fear of negative evaluation,"Seinsche, R. J.; Walter, B.; Fricke, S.; Neudert, M. K.; Zehtner, R. I.; Stark, R.; Hermann, A.","The experience of socially aversive events is proposed to be a critical etiological factor in the development of social anxiety symptoms even though the experience itself is also common among healthy individuals. Rather than the event itself, accompanying factors such as maladaptive processing might be associated with higher levels of social anxiety symptoms. One-hundred-seventy-four individuals participated in this online-survey comprising questionnaires regarding social anxiety symptoms and retrospective reports concerning maladaptive processing of the worst socially aversive event. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the hypothesized mediation of maladaptive processing and fear of negative evaluation by intrusive re-experiencing and social phobic beliefs. The positive association between retrospectively evaluated maladaptive processing after the worst socially aversive event and fear of negative evaluation was mediated by social phobic beliefs but not by intrusive re-experiencing. These results point towards the relevance of further investigating processing strategies after socially aversive events as a potential influencing factor for SAD development. Trial registration.

Emotional modulation of the attentional blink and the relation to interpersonal reactivity,"Kanske, P.; Schonfelder, S.; Wessa, M.","The extent of the attentional blink effect on detection rates in rapid serial visual presentations is modulated by the emotionality of the stimuli. Emotionally salient stimuli are detected more often, even if presented in the attentional blink period, and elicit an enlarged P3 response, which has been interpreted as enhanced consolidation. This effect correlates with individual differences in trait affectivity such as anxiety or dysphoria. Here, we ask if it is also related to the capacity to detect emotions in others, i.e., to interpersonal social traits. We therefore presented emotional and neutral images depicting social scenes as targets in an attentional blink design and measured detection rates and event-related potentials. In addition, we recorded self-reports of empathy as measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The results show enhanced performance for emotional stimuli and increased P3 amplitudes, which correlated with individual differences in empathy. The data suggest that self-reported empathy goes along with enhanced processing of emotion in social stimuli, even under stimulus conditions that are suboptimal for conscious target detection.",2013,,Front Hum Neurosci,7,,641,24130525.0,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00641,,#1903,Kanske 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
We prefer what we fear: A response preference bias mimics attentional capture in spider fear,"Haberkamp, A.; Biafora, M.; Schmidt, T.; Weiss, K.","The extent to which emotionally significant stimuli capture visual attention remains elusive because a preference for reporting or choosing emotionally significant stimuli could mimic attentional capture by these stimuli. We conducted two prior-entry experiments to disentangle whether phobic and fear-relevant stimuli capture attention or merely produce a response bias in spider-fearful participants. Prior entry denotes the effect that attended stimuli are perceived earlier than unattended stimuli as indicated by temporal order judgments. We presented phobic (spiders), fear-relevant (snakes) and neutral stimuli in pairs with varying temporal onset. The participants' task was to indicate which stimulus was presented first (Experiment 1) or second (Experiment 2). In the first experiment, spider-fearful but not control participants indicated that they had perceived spiders as occurring earlier in time, suggesting a prior-entry effect for spiders in this group. But surprisingly, in the second experiment, spider-fearful participants indicated more frequently that they had seen spiders as being presented second. This finding rules out a genuine prior-entry effect and instead suggests a strong preference for the response option associated with the feared animal. This response bias may result from a hypervigilance toward the feared stimulus and contribute to maintaining avoidance behavior in individuals with specific phobias.",2018,Jan,J Anxiety Disord,53,,30-38,29156434.0,10.1016/j.janxdis.2017.10.008,,#1904,Haberkamp 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Rapid Neural Representations of Personally Relevant Faces,"Bayer, M.; Berhe, O.; Dziobek, I.; Johnstone, T.","The faces of those most personally relevant to us are our primary source of social information, making their timely perception a priority.

We applied simultaneous EEG-fMRI to examine neural responses to emotional faces of female participants' romantic partners, friends, and a stranger. Combining EEG and fMRI in cross-modal representational similarity analyses, we provide evidence that representations of personal relevance start prior to structural encoding at 100 ms, with correlated representations in visual cortex, but also in prefrontal and midline regions involved in value representation, and monitoring and recall of self-relevant information.

Switching Attention Within Working Memory is Reflected in the P3a Component of the Human Event-Related Brain Potential,"Berti, S.","The flexible access to information in working memory is crucial for adaptive behavior. It is assumed that this is realized by switching the focus of attention within working memory. Switching of attention is mirrored in the P3a component of the human event-related brain potential (ERP) and it has been argued that the processes reflected by the P3a are also relevant for selecting information within working memory. The aim of the present study was to further evaluate whether the P3a mirrors genuine switching of attention within working memory by applying an object switching task: Participants updated a memory list of four digits either by replacing one item with another digit or by processing the stored digit. ERPs were computed separately for two types of trials: (1) trials in which an object was repeated and (2) trials in which a switch to a new object was required in order to perform the task. Object-switch trials showed increased response times compared with repetition trials in both task conditions. In addition, switching costs were increased in the processing compared with the replacement condition. Pronounced P3a's were obtained in switching trials but there were no difference between the two updating tasks (replacement or processing). These results were qualified by the finding that the magnitude of the visual location shift also affects the ERPs in the P3a time window. Taken together, the present pattern of results suggest that the P3a reflects an initial process of selecting information in working memory but not the memory updating itself.",2015,2016/01/06,Front Hum Neurosci,9,,701,26779009.0,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00701,,#1907,Berti 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Women with AN (n = 39), BN (n = 37) and a control group (CG, n = 41) were randomly assigned to either engage in suppression or reappraisal during a sadness-eliciting film clip. Levels of drive to eat, anticipated loss of control over eating and ruminative thoughts were rated before and after the induction of emotion regulation. Induced expressive suppression led to a decrease of reported drive to eat in AN and an increase of anticipated loss of control over eating in BN.

Early prefrontal brain responses to the Hedonic quality of emotional words--a simultaneous EEG and MEG study,"Keuper, K.; Zwitserlood, P.; Rehbein, M. A.; Eden, A. S.; Laeger, I.; Junghofer, M.; Zwanzger, P.; Dobel, C.","The hedonic meaning of words affects word recognition, as shown by behavioral, functional imaging, and event-related potential (ERP) studies. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics and cognitive functions behind are elusive, partly due to methodological limitations of previous studies. Here, we account for these difficulties by computing combined electro-magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) source localization techniques. Participants covertly read emotionally high-arousing positive and negative nouns, while EEG and MEG were recorded simultaneously. Combined EEG/MEG current-density reconstructions for the P1 (80-120 ms), P2 (150-190 ms) and EPN component (200-300 ms) were computed using realistic individual head models, with a cortical constraint. Relative to negative words, the P1 to positive words predominantly involved language-related structures (left middle temporal and inferior frontal regions), and posterior structures related to directed attention (occipital and parietal regions). Effects shifted to the right hemisphere in the P2 component. By contrast, negative words received more activation in the P1 time-range only, recruiting prefrontal regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Effects in the EPN were not statistically significant. These findings show that different neuronal networks are active when positive versus negative words are processed. We account for these effects in terms of an ""emotional tagging"" of word forms during language acquisition. These tags then give rise to different processing strategies, including enhanced lexical processing of positive words and a very fast language-independent alert response to negative words. The valence-specific recruitment of different networks might underlie fast adaptive responses to both approach- and withdrawal-related stimuli, be they acquired or biological.",2013,2013/08/05,PLOS ONE,8,8,e70788,23940642.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0070788,,#1912,Keuper 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

However, it is not clear if major stress in childhood development also affects olfactory functioning and OB volume in humans. OB volume was measured and olfactory function was tested in 17 depressive patients with and 10 without a history of severe childhood maltreatment (CM). CM patients exhibited a significantly reduced olfactory threshold and identification ability. The OB volume of the CM patients was significantly reduced to 80% of the non-CM patients.

The demotivating effect of social exclusion: An experimental test of a psychosocial model on the development of negative symptoms in psychosis,"Pillny, M.; Lincoln, T. M.","The impairment in social functioning of patients with psychotic disorders is mainly driven by motivational negative symptoms with a widely unknown etiology. Building on the well-confirmed link between specific social risk factors and psychosis, the current study tested the postulated effect of immediate social exclusion on the development of motivational negative symptoms and the association of repeated social exclusion experiences with demotivating beliefs in a community sample (N = 84). Repeated social exclusion experiences and demotivating beliefs were assessed at baseline. We randomized the participants to either an exclusion or an inclusion condition of a virtual ball tossing game. Motivation and anticipatory pleasure were measured before and after the manipulation via self-report and via a behavioral effort paradigm. We found a significant multivariate effect of social exclusion on self-reported motivation (F(4,79) = 4.25, p < .01, eta2 = .18), but not on behavioral effort (F(1,82) = 1.24, p = .27, eta2 = .02). Repeated social exclusion was significantly associated with demotivating beliefs (r = .58, p < .01) and negative symptoms (r = .43, p < .001). Our findings support the notion that reduced motivation, anticipatory anhedonia and demotivating beliefs can be understood as motivational and cognitive consequences of social exclusion.

Influence of violent video gaming on determinants of the acquired capability for suicide,"Teismann, T.; Fortsch, E.

Repeated experiences with painful and provocative events are supposed to cause an incremental increase in acquired capability. The present study examined whether playing a first-person shooter-game in contrast to a first-person racing game increases pain tolerance, a dimension of the acquired capability construct, and risk-taking behavior, a risk factor for developing acquired capability. N=81 male participants were randomly assigned to either play an action-shooter or a racing game before engaging in a game on risk-taking behavior and performing a cold pressor task (CPT). Participants exhibited higher pain tolerance after playing an action shooter game than after playing a racing game. Furthermore, playing an action shooter was generally associated with heightened risk-taking behavior. Group-differences were not attributable to the effects of the different types of games on self-reported mood and arousal. Overall these results indicate that action-shooter gaming alters pain tolerance and risk-taking behavior.

The capability is proposed to be acquired over time by repeated experiences with painful and provocative events such as self-injurious behavior and other experiences such as childhood abuse, combat exposure, physical fights, promiscuous sex, and playing contact sports. Up to now, experiences with painful and provocative events are measured with various versions of the Painful and Provocative Events Scale (PPES). However, a thorough validation of this assessment instrument is still lacking. Our study aimed at validating the German version of PPES, with two clinical (n=424) and one community sample (n=532). Results support a two-factor structure (eight items ""active painful and provocative events"", four items ""passive painful and provocative events"") that was invariant across the three subsamples.

Central Sympathetic Nervous System Effects on Cognitive-Motor Performance,"Finke, J. B.; Schachinger, H.","The intriguing interplay between acute stress physiology and cognitive processes has long been noted. However, while stress-induced release of glucocorticoids has repeatedly been shown to impact brain mechanisms underlying cognition and memory, less experimental research addressed the effects of stress-induced central sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation on cognitive performance. Moreover, despite the long-standing notion that the way performance is modulated by arousal may crucially depend on task complexity, mechanistic research demonstrating a direct, causal influence of altered SNS activity is scarce. Twelve healthy men participated in a placebo-controlled, pharmacologic dose-response study involving three within-subject assessments (1-week intervals). Subjective and objective indices of SNS activity as well as reaction time (RT) in three different tasks varying in cognitive demand (simple RT, choice RT, and verbal RT in complex mental arithmetic) were assessed during modulation of central SNS tone by intravenous infusions of dexmedetomidine (alpha2-agonist), yohimbine (alpha2-antagonist), and placebo. Cognitive performance was negatively affected by alpha2-agonism in all task conditions. By contrast, administration of yohimbine improved simple RT, while diminishing complex RT, supporting the assumption of a nonlinear way of action depending on task characteristics.

Increased skin conductance responses and neural activity during fear conditioning are associated with a repressive coping style,"Klucken, T.; Kruse, O.; Schweckendiek, J.; Stark, R.","The investigation of individual differences in coping styles in response to fear conditioning is an important issue for a better understanding of the etiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders. It has been assumed that an avoidant (repressive) coping style is characterized by increased emotion regulation efforts in context of fear stimuli as compared to a more vigilant coping style. However, no study so far has investigated the neural correlates of fear conditioning of repressors and sensitizers. In the present fMRI study, 76 participants were classified as repressors or as sensitizers and were exposed to a fear conditioning paradigm, in which the CS+ predicted electrical stimulation, while another neutral stimulus (CS-) did not. In addition, skin conductance responses (SCRs) were measured continuously. As the main findings, we found increased neural activity in repressors as compared to sensitizers in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during fear conditioning. In addition, elevated activity to the CS+ in amygdala, insula, occipital, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as well as elevated conditioned SCRs were found in repressors. The present results demonstrate increased neural activations in structures linked to emotion down-regulation mechanisms like the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which may reflect the increased coping effort in repressors. At the same time, repressors showed increased activations in arousal and evaluation-associated structures like the amygdala, the occipital cortex (OCC), and the OFC, which was mirrored in increased SCRs. The present results support recent assumptions about a two-process model of repression postulating a fast vigilant response to fear stimuli, and a second process associated with the down-regulation of emotional responses.",2015,2015/06/02,Front Behav Neurosci,9,,132,26082695.0,10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00132,,#1928,Klucken 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

We investigated 33 carriers of the Met allele (18 females) and 32 homozygous carriers of the Val allele (15 females) with a virtual-reality context-conditioning paradigm. Electric stimulations (unconditioned stimulus, US) were unpredictably delivered in one virtual office (CTX+), but never in another virtual office (CTX-). During generalization, participants revisited CTX+ and CTX- and a generalization office (G-CTX), which was a mix of the other two. Rating data indicated successful conditioning (more negative valence, higher arousal, anxiety and contingency ratings for CTX+ than CTX-), and generalization of conditioned anxiety by comparable ratings for G-CTX and CTX+. The startle data indicated discriminative learning for Met allele carriers, but not for Val homozygotes. Moreover, a trend effect suggests that startle responses of only the Met carriers were slightly potentiated in G-CTX versus CTX-. In sum, the BDNF polymorphism did not affect contextual learning and its generalization on a verbal level. However, the physiological data suggest that Met carriers are characterized by fast discriminative contextual learning and a tendency to generalize anxiety responses to ambiguous contexts. We propose that such learning may be related to reduced hippocampal functionality and the basis for the risk of Met carriers to develop anxiety disorders.",2019,Mar,J Neurosci Res,97,3,300-312,30402941.0,10.1002/jnr.24345,,#1931,Andreatta 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
The Hand-Withdrawal-Method - An Adapted and Simplified Method of Limits for Behavioral Heat Pain Assessment,"Kamper-Fuhrmann, E.; Winkler, A.; Hahn, A.; Hermann, C.","The method-of-limits (MLI) is an established psychophysical procedure, for example for determining thermal thresholds. The standard MLI relies on fixating the thermode at the stimulation site by means of a strap and requires the participant to terminate the increase in heat by pressing a button. This, however, raises concerns regarding safety and task complexity in specific populations, such as cognitively impaired individuals, people with high fear of pain or young children (< 6 years). In this study, we aimed at developing a simplified version of the commonly used MLI for testing heat pain threshold (HPT) and tolerance (HPTol), and at validating it as a first step in healthy adults. Heating is terminated by withdrawing the hand from the heat probe, thereby ensuring maximum control and safety. For validation, HPTs and HPTols were assessed with the novel ""hand-withdrawal-method"" (HWM) and compared to the standard MLI, using a within-subject design. Additionally, as one potential research area in which the HWM may be used, we explored expectancy-induced placebo hypoalgesic effects by comparing results of standard MLI with those of HWM. Our data confirm good concordance between the 2 methods. For none of the outcomes significant differences between the 2 methods were found. PERSPECTIVE: In the present study in healthy adults, an adapted simplified and safe method of limits was demonstrated to be equivalent to the standard method-of-limits.

Were we erring? The impact of worry and arousal on error-related negativity in a non-clinical sample,"Harpfer, K.; Carsten, H. P.; Spychalski, D.; Kathmann, N.; Riesel, A.","The monitoring of one's own actions allows humans to adjust to a changing and complex world. Previous neuroscientific research found overactive action monitoring and increased sensitivity to errors to be associated with anxiety and it is assumed to contribute to the development and maintenance of anxiety symptoms. A largely shared decomposition of anxiety differentiates two dimensions: anxious apprehension (i.e., worry) and anxious arousal (i.e., physiological hyperarousal). Alterations in neural correlates of error monitoring have been more closely linked to anxious apprehension compared to anxious arousal. This study examined the relationship between anxiety dimensions and electrophysiological correlates of action monitoring (i.e., error-related negativity, ERN, and correct-response negativity, CRN). A total of 135 non-clinical participants performed a flanker task while their electroencephalogram was recorded. We recruited participants with converging and diverging anxiety dimension profiles (i.e., above or below median in anxious apprehension and anxious arousal or above median in one and below in the other dimension). This grouping strategy facilitates disentangling possible interactions and allows the investigation of the isolated effect of each anxiety dimension. Regression analyses did not reveal a significant main or interaction effect of anxiety dimensions on ERN or CRN, irrespective of gender. In addition, Bayesian statistical analyzes yielded evidence for the absence of an association between both anxiety dimensions and ERN and CRN. Altogether, our results suggest that the association of anxiety dimensions, particularly anxious apprehension, and action monitoring might be smaller in non-clinical samples as previous studies indicate.",2020,Nov,Psychophysiology,57,11,e13661,32804403.0,10.1111/psyp.13661,,#1933,Harpfer 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

We applied an implicit association test (IAT) in 20 subjects during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate behavioral and neural correlates of implicit attitudes toward symptom words. On the behavioral level, body symptom words elicited strong negative implicit association effects, as indexed by slowed reaction times, when symptom words were paired with the attribute ""harmless"" (incongruent condition). fMRI revealed increased activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex for the comparison of incongruent words with control words, as well as with a lower significance threshold also in comparison to congruent words. Moreover, activation in the DLPFC, posterior parietal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and cerebellum varied with individual levels of HA (again, in comparison to control words, as well as with a lower significance threshold also in comparison to congruent words). Slowed reaction times as well as increased activation in dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex point to increased inhibitory demands during the incongruent IAT condition.

Women diagnosed with BPD had significantly reduced oxytocin concentrations, even after controlling for estrogen, progesterone, and contraceptive intake. In addition, plasma oxytocin correlated negatively with experiences of childhood traumata, in particular with emotional neglect and abuse. The results of mediation analyses do not support a model of oxytocin being a prominent mediator in the link between childhood trauma and BPD.

The number line estimation task is a valid tool for assessing mathematical achievement: A population-level study with 6484 Luxembourgish ninth-graders,"Nuraydin, S.; Stricker, J.; Ugen, S.; Martin, R.; Schneider, M.","The number line estimation task is an often-used measure of numerical magnitude understanding.

This raises the question of whether the task would be a useful component of mathematical achievement tests and instruments to diagnose dyscalculia or mathematical giftedness and whether a stand-alone version of the task can serve as a short screener for mathematical achievement. Previous studies on the relation between number line estimation accuracy and broader mathematical achievement were limited in that they used relatively small nonrepresentative samples and usually did not account for potentially confounding variables. To close this research gap, we report findings from a population-level study with nearly all Luxembourgish ninth-graders (N = 6484). We used multilevel regressions to test how a standardized mathematical achievement test relates to the accuracy in number line estimation on bounded number lines with whole numbers and fractions. We also investigated how these relations were moderated by classroom characteristics, person characteristics, and trial characteristics. Mathematical achievement and number line estimation accuracy were associated even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Subpopulations of students showed meaningful differences in estimation accuracy, which can serve as benchmarks in future studies.

German Anxiety Barometer-Clinical and Everyday-Life Anxieties in the General Population,"Adolph, D.; Schneider, S.; Margraf, J.","The objective of this study was to test a time-efficient screening instrument to assess clinically relevant and everyday-life (e.g., economic, political, personal) anxieties. Furthermore, factors influencing these anxieties, correlations between clinical and everyday anxieties and, for the first time, anxiety during different stages of life were assessed in a representative sample of the general population (N = 2229). Around 30% of the respondents manifested at least one disorder-specific key symptom within 1 year (women > men), 8% reported severe anxiety symptoms. Two thirds of respondents reported minor everyday anxieties and 5% were strongly impaired, whereby persons with severe clinical symptoms were more frequently affected. A variety of potential influencing factors could be identified. These include, in addition to socioeconomic status, gender, general health, risk-taking, and leisure behavior, also some up to now little investigated possible protective factors, such as everyday-life mental activity.

Based on a school sample of 1,539 parents and 731 children, we explored the psychometric properties and dimensionality of the original and a shortened revised version. A clinical sample of 70 parental reports served as an additional sample. Walker et al.'s item selection could be largely replicated. Dimensionality differed between samples and versions (original vs. revised), but original DSM-III symptom clusters could mostly be identified. Symptom intensity was associated with age and mental health. Internal consistency, test-retest- and inter-rater reliability were good.

Efficacy of Applied Relaxation as indicated preventive intervention in individuals at increased risk for mental disorders: A randomized controlled trial,"Beesdo-Baum, K.; Zenker, M.; Ruckert, F.; Kische, H.; Pieper, L.; Asselmann, E.","The objective was to examine the efficacy of Applied Relaxation (AR) as indicated preventive intervention to reduce psychopathological symptoms and prevent incident mental disorders. In a parallel-group randomized controlled trial, N = 277 adults with elevated tension/distress, anxiety, or depressive symptomatology (Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale, DASS-21) but no 12-month DSM-5 diagnosis of any mental disorder assessed via standardized interview (DIA-X-5) were randomized to an intervention group (IG; n = 139) receiving group-based AR training, or an assessment-only control group (CG, n = 138). Self-report questionnaires at baseline, post (immediately after the 10 week intervention or a similar time frame in CG) and 12-month follow-up included the DASS-21 as primary outcome measure of intervention efficacy. Incident subthreshold and threshold mental disorders were assessed via DIA-X-5 at 12-month follow-up as primary outcome of prevention efficacy. Intervention and prevention effects were examined on an intent-to-treat basis with missing data replaced using chained multiple imputation. Mixed-model analyses revealed accelerated symptom improvement in IG versus CG with a medium baseline-to-post between-group effect size (d = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.36-0.82).

Effect sizes (Hedges' g) were calculated for several outcome variables to determine effectiveness. Predictor analyses were performed on a subsample (N = 514; M = 34.3 years, SD = 12.2; 60.3% female). For this purpose, the number of potential predictors was reduced using factor analysis, followed by multiple regression analysis to identify robust predictors. Effect sizes of various outcome variables could be classified as large (g = 1.34 of OCD-symptom change). Predictors of changes in OCD and depressive symptoms were symptom severity at admission and general psychopathological distress. In addition, patients with higher social support and more washing compulsions benefited more from treatment. Subgroup analyses showed a distinct predictor profile of changes in compulsions and obsessions.

RESULTS: The OPD-CQ comprises 66 items with which active and passive modes of coping with six conflicts as well as defended perception of conflict and emotions can be assessed. Some of the scales had a rather low internal consistency. An investigation of the factor structure of the OPD-CQ scales revealed five factors that could be meaningfully interpreted. The OPD-CQ scales showed expected correlations with other clinically relevant instruments. In addition, we showed the incremental validity of the OPD-CQ scales regarding the prediction of psychological distress and life satisfaction above and beyond structural deficits.

Enhanced functional connectivity between sensorimotor and visual cortex predicts covariation bias in spider phobia,"Wiemer, J.; Pauli, P.","The overestimation of the relationship between fear-relevant stimuli and aversive consequences, a so called covariation bias, might contribute to the maintenance of anxiety disorders. In a recent fMRI study, we confronted spider phobia and healthy participants with pictures of spiders, mushrooms and puppies, randomly followed by painful electric stimuli (US). Spider phobics overestimated the spider-US association and displayed enhanced activity in US-related sensorimotor cortex (paracentral lobule, PCL). Here, we report results from an additional functional connectivity analysis. Within spider phobics but not in healthy controls, USs after spiders led to enhanced connectivity between PCL and left prefrontal cortex (PFC). Most importantly, covariation bias in spider phobia was predicted by connectivity between PCL and visual cortex, insula, primary sensorimotor cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex. Reduced covariation bias was predicted by connectivity between PCL and PFC. In response to spider pictures, the amygdala was functionally connected to somatosensory and visual areas. These results suggest that synchronous activity of sensory cortices may promote fear-sustaining associative memory bias, while right PFC might help to reduce bias.",2016,Dec,Biol Psychol,121,Pt B,128-137,26805508.0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.01.007,,#1951,Wiemer 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

We used a cognitive bias modification paradigm targeting appraisals of a stressful event, Cognitive Bias Modification-Appraisal, to investigate whether d-cycloserine enhanced the modification of appraisal, and whether it caused greater reduction in indices of psychopathology. Participants received either 250 mg of d-cycloserine ( n=19) or placebo ( n=19). As a stressor task, participants recalled a negative life event, followed by positive Cognitive Bias Modification-Appraisal training.

Cognitive Bias Modification-Appraisal successfully modified appraisals, but d-cycloserine did not affect appraisals post-training. There were no post-training group differences in frequency of intrusions. Interestingly, d-cycloserine led to a greater reduction in distress and impact on state mood from recalling the event, and lower distress post-training was associated with fewer intrusions. Therefore, d-cycloserine may affect emotional reactivity to recalling a negative event when combined with induction of a positive appraisal style, but via a mechanism other than enhanced learning of the appraisal style.",2018,May,J Psychopharmacol,32,5,569-577,29446699.0,10.1177/0269881118754679,,#1952,Woud 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

All's Bad That Ends Bad: There Is a Peak-End Memory Bias in Anxiety,"Muller, U. W. D.; Witteman, C. L. M.; Spijker, J.; Alpers, G. W.","The peak-end memory bias has been well documented for the retrospective evaluation of pain. It describes that the retrospective evaluation of pain is largely based on the discomfort experienced at the most intense point (peak) and at the end of the episode. This is notable because it means that longer episodes with a better ending can be remembered as less aversive than shorter ones; this is even if the former had the same peak in painfulness and an overall longer duration of pain. Until now, this bias has not been studied in the domain of anxiety despite the high relevance of variable levels of anxiety in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Therefore, we set out to replicate the original studies but with an induction of variable levels of anxiety. Of 64 women, half watched a clip from a horror movie which ended at the most frightening moment. The other half watched an extended version of this clip with a moderately frightening ending. Afterward, all participants were asked to rate the global anxiety which was elicited by the video. When the film ended at the most frightening moment, participants retrospectively reported more anxiety than participants who watched the extended version. This is the first study to document that the peak-end bias can be found in the domain of anxiety.

Gender-Specific Relation Between Olfactory Sensitivity and Disgust Perception,"Croy, I.; Bendas, J.; Wittrodt, N.; Lenk, M.; Joraschky, P.; Weidner, K.","The perception of disgust is a powerful but yet puzzling emotion, aiming at the prevention of potential microbial pathogens and being directly linked to olfactory processing in its neurophysiological pathways via the anterior insular cortex. In sample of healthy participants with a natural variation in olfactory function, we investigated the relation between olfactory sensitivity and disgust perception. A total of 123 healthy individuals were surveyed with a disgust sensitivity questionnaire. Olfactory threshold was assessed in all participants using the Sniffin' Sticks. Additionally, tactile 2-point discrimination threshold was tested in a subgroup of the participants as a controlling factor for the specificity of the relationship between olfactory sensitivity and disgust. Only in men, a significant relation between disgust ratings and olfactory threshold was observed. Men with high olfactory sensitivity reported as high levels of disgust as female participants, while men with low olfactory sensitivity reported significantly lower disgust than women. There was no such relation for tactile sensitivity. Investigating sensory subscales of the disgust questionnaire, olfactory sensitivity was related to olfactory and tactile, but not to visual disgust ratings. In conclusion, there is a specific relation between the level of disgust and olfactory sensitivity in men, who generally present lower values of disgust than women. When disgust ratings are low, there seems to be an additional merit in the ability to perceive subtle olfactory stimuli. Thus high olfactory sensitivity may facilitate the perception of potential pathogenic threats and contribute to the evolutionary function of disgust as disease avoidance mechanism.",2017,Jul 1,Chem Senses,42,6,487-492,28073838.0,10.1093/chemse/bjw163,,#1955,Croy 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Microstructural alterations in medial forebrain bundle are associated with interindividual pain sensitivity,"Geisler, M.; Rizzoni, E.; Makris, N.; Pasternak, O.; Rathi, Y.; Bouix, S.; Herbsleb, M.; Bar, K.

The comprised brain structures and their white matter pathways are complex and elusive. Here, we aimed to investigate whether variation of microstructure of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB), a tract connecting the basal forebrain with the brain stem, is associated with interindividual pain sensitivity. We assessed interindividual pain sensitivity as a rating of pain intensity to heat stimuli (45, 47, and 48.9 degrees C) in 38 healthy men (age: 27.05 +/- 5.7 years). We also reconstructed the MFB using multitensor tractography from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and calculated free-water corrected dMRI measures of fractional anisotropy (FA(t) ), radial diffusivity (RD(t) ), and axial diffusivity (AD(t) ). Lower ratings of interindividual pain intensity correlated with higher FA(t) and lower RD(t) of the MFB. As changes in FA(t) and RD(t) may reflect abnormalities in myelination, the results might be interpreted as that a lower pain rating is associated with higher degree of myelination of the MFB and could represent an inhibitory pathway of pain. Our results suggest that alteration of microstructure in the MFB contributes to the interindividual variation of pain perception.",2021,Mar,Hum Brain Mapp,42,4,1130-1137,33170528.0,10.1002/hbm.25281,,#1956,Geisler 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Interoceptive focus shapes the experience of time,"Pollatos, O.; Laubrock, J.; Wittmann, M.","The perception of time is a fundamental part of human experience. Recent research suggests that the experience of time emerges from emotional and interoceptive (bodily) states as processed in the insular cortex. Whether there is an interaction between the conscious awareness of interoceptive states and time distortions induced by emotions has rarely been investigated so far. We aimed to address this question by the use of a retrospective time estimation task comparing two groups of participants. One group had a focus on interoceptive states and one had a focus on exteroceptive information while watching film clips depicting fear, amusement and neutral content. Main results were that attention to interoceptive processes significantly affected subjective time experience. Fear was accompanied with subjective time dilation that was more pronounced in the group with interoceptive focus, while amusement led to a quicker passage of time which was also increased by interoceptive focus. We conclude that retrospective temporal distortions are directly influenced by attention to bodily responses. These effects might crucially interact with arousal levels. Sympathetic nervous system activation affecting memory build-up might be the decisive factor influencing retrospective time judgments. Our data substantially extend former research findings underscoring the relevance of interoception for the effects of emotional states on subjective time experience.",2014,2014/01/29,PLOS ONE,9,1,e86934,24489807.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0086934,,#1957,Pollatos 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Time is of the essence: past selves are not prioritized even when selective discrimination costs are controlled for,"Englert, J.; von Lampe, K.; Morina, N.","The perceptual Self-Prioritization effect (SPE) refers to an advantage in attending to stimuli associated with the self relative to those associated with another individual. In the perceptual matching task, arbitrary pairings between oneself and other persons, and a geometric shape need to be learned. Apart from the SPE, this task also produces high matching performance for a close other. While cognitive representations of past selves are sometimes viewed as resembling that of an intimate other, and while there is some evidence that other types of psychological closeness modulate the SPE, it remains unclear whether such prioritization effects extend to past selves. Previous experiments on this topic required participants to distinguish between different points in time within the same task, raising the possibility that potential past self-prioritization was masked by task difficulty. In our experiment, we addressed this potential confound by presenting N = 118 participants with a simpler version of the matching task. We re-investigated self-prioritization in perceptual matching under conditions of mental time travel to the past. In line with previous evidence, we found clear prioritization of present selves, which was evident in response times, accuracies and the efficiency of practice. Performance was consistently poorest for the past self, indicating not only a lack of privileged processing, but rather a relative de-prioritization. Performance was not improved by either increased proximity of the time period in question, nor by experimenter-induced re-imagining of the self. Our results do not support a perceptual prioritization of past selves.",2023,Apr,Psychol Res,87,3,768-786,35804070.0,10.1007/s00426-022-01702-x,,#1958,Englert 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Participants (N = 144) from the community were randomized to either an experimental group (EG) or a control group (CG). While the EG was presented with health messages, the CG was presented with neutral information. Before and after manipulation, participants completed measures of explicit and implicit WB. Paired samples t-test revealed no differences in explicit WB after manipulation, however, a small effect decrease of implicit WB in the EG but not in the CG was found. This study provided evidence that health messages might have differential impact to change WB. According to dual-model approaches, explicit and implicit WB tap into two different information processing systems, and thus were differentially affected by health messages.

Attachment Manifestations in Daily Interpersonal Interactions,"Kaurin, A.; Pilkonis, P. A.; Wright, A. G. C.","The predominant focus in attachment research on trait-like individual differences has overshadowed investigation of the ways in which working models of attachment represent dynamic, interpersonally responsive socio-affective systems. Intensive longitudinal designs extend previous work by evaluating to what extent attachment varies over social interactions and the functional processes that underlie its fluctuation. We examined momentary activation of attachment orientations in the stream of peoples' daily lives and how those patterns were linked to interpersonal behavior. Based on an event-contingent, ambulatory 7-day assessment protocol (N=263; 3,971 interactions) operationalized using Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory, we examined whether contextually activated working models accounted for patterns of interpersonal (anti-)complementarity. Our analyses revealed that the situational activation of working models varied as a function of interpersonal perceptions of warmth, which were linked to greater state security and lower levels of anxious or avoidant expectations. These reactivity patterns, in turn, accounted for interpersonal complementarity. Avoidant attachment was linked to diminished and secure attachment to enhanced expressions of warmth. The analyses were robust even when controlling for momentary positive and negative affect and closeness of the relationship. Attachment expectations wax and wane across daily social interactions, and such fluctuations are reflective primarily of a process in which perceptions of others' warmth activate secure attachment expectations and lower insecure ones.

The first experimental group (N = 200) waived smartphone use for 7 days, the second experimental group (N = 226) reduced its daily use by 1 hr, and the control group (N = 193) used smartphone as usual. Variables of smartphone use (time, intensity, problematic tendencies), life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, physical activity, and smoking behavior were assessed via online surveys at four measurement time points (baseline; postintervention; 1 and 4 months after postintervention). Both interventions reduced smartphone use intensity, problematic use tendencies, depressive, and anxiety symptoms. In both groups, life satisfaction and physical activity increased. Most effects were stronger and remained more stable over 4 months in the reduction group than in the abstinence group. Moreover, in the reduction group only, the number of daily smoked cigarettes decreased. Thus, less time spent on the smartphone leads to more well-being and a healthier lifestyle; a complete smartphone abstinence is not necessary. Programs that focus on the increase of well-being and a healthier lifestyle could benefit from the integration of controlled reduction of smartphone use. A potential ""sweet spot"" of smartphone use is discussed.

Are you looking or looking away? Visual exploration and avoidance of disgust- and fear-stimuli: An eye-tracking study,"Fink-Lamotte, J.; Svensson, F.; Schmitz, J.; Exner, C.","The present eye-tracking study investigates whether individuals with different levels of contamination fear are more likely to focus their attention on disgusting stimuli to explore them or to pull their attention away to avoid them. Ninety-two nonclinical participants with varying degrees of contamination fear performed a dot probe task. Eye-tracking methodology was employed to record gaze patterns during the task. In each trial participants looked at two pictures (disgust-neutral, fear-neutral, or neutral-neutral). Participants were further asked about the contents of the picture and the confidence of their answer. The results show that reaction times were slower and fixations were longer and more frequent for disgust targets compared with fear and neutral targets, which was further amplified in individuals with high contamination fear. However, image details of disgusting pictures were remembered less correctly than details of fearful pictures. These findings confirm the idea that attention on disgusting stimuli is maintained. Further, the findings indicate that disgust is processed more superficially and might also be related to disgust-associated uncertainty and ambiguity. The results may help to understand the difficult-to-change nature of disgust, which could be relevant to habituation and extinction processes in exposure therapy.

FAD was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms).

Using ecological momentary assessment, 40 currently depressed individuals and 40 healthy controls reported on their current emotional state and current activities 10 times a day for 4 consecutive days. There were no differences in the dynamics of positive affect (PA) between depressed and healthy subjects. Depressed participants' negative affect (NA), however, was found to be more inert than in healthy controls, while at the same time being more variable and more reactive to positive events. There was also an association between emotional instability and depression, but this was rendered nonsignificant when analyses were controlled for emotional variability. Altogether, emotional dynamics of NA appear to be more prominently disturbed in depression compared to PA. Results support earlier findings on NA emotional variability as well as inertia in depressed patients. In addition, there was some evidence for a mood brightening effect in depression.

Use of computer games was found to be negatively related to these personality and mental health variables. The use of platforms that focus more on written interaction (Twitter, Tumblr) was assumed to be negatively associated with positive mental health variables and significantly positively with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms.

The Brief Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (Fragebogen zur Sozialen Unterstutzung Kurzform mit sechs Items, F-SozU K-6) was examined in representative and university student samples from the United States (N(representative) = 3038), Germany (N(representative) = 2007, N(student) = 5406), Russia (N(representative) = 3020, N(student) = 4001), and China (N(student) = 13,582). Cross-cultural measurement invariance testing was conducted in both representative and student samples across countries. Scores on the F-SozU K-6 demonstrated good reliability and strong model fit for a unidimensional structure in all samples, with the exception of poor model fit for German students. The scores on F-SozU K-6 correlated negatively with scores on depression, anxiety, and stress measures and positively with scores on positive mental health measures. Norms for gender and age groups were established separately based on each representative sample. Cross-cultural measurement invariance testing found partial strong measurement invariance across three general population samples and three student samples. Furthermore, a simulation study showed that the amount of invariance observed in the partial invariance model had only a negligible impact on mean comparisons.

Cognitive deficits are a matter of emotional context: inflexible strategy use mediates context-specific learning impairments in OCD,"Zetsche, U.; Rief, W.; Westermann, S.; Exner, C.","The present study examines the interplay between cognitive deficits and emotional context in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia (SP). Specifically, this study examines whether the inflexible use of efficient learning strategies in an emotional context underlies impairments in probabilistic classification learning (PCL) in OCD, and whether PCL impairments are specific to OCD. Twenty-three participants with OCD, 30 participants with SP and 30 healthy controls completed a neutral and an OCD-specific PCL task. OCD participants failed to adopt efficient learning strategies and showed fewer beneficial strategy switches than controls only in an OCD-specific context, but not in a neutral context. Additionally, OCD participants did not show any explicit memory impairments. Number of beneficial strategy switches in the OCD-specific task mediated the difference in PCL performance between OCD and control participants. Individuals with SP were impaired in both PCL tasks. In contrast to neuropsychological models postulating general cognitive impairments in OCD, the present findings suggest that it is the interaction between cognition and emotion that is impaired in OCD. Specifically, activated disorder-specific fears may impair the flexible adoption of efficient learning strategies and compromise otherwise unimpaired PCL.

Using event-related potentials (ERP) we monitored the brain activity of 3-month-old infants when they were repeatedly exposed to several initially novel words paired consistently with each the same initially novel objects or inconsistently with different objects. Our results provide strong evidence that these young infants extract statistic regularities in the distribution of the co-occurrences of objects and words extremely quickly. The data suggest that this ability is based on the rapid formation of associations between the neural representations of objects and words, but that the new associations are not retained in long-term memory until the next day. The type of brain response moreover indicates that, unlike in older infants, in 3-month-olds a semantic processing stage is not involved. Their ability to combine words with meaningful information is caused by a primary learning mechanism that enables the formation of proto-words and acts as a precursor for the acquisition of genuine words.",2017,Mar,Dev Sci,20,2,e12357,26548459.0,10.1111/desc.12357,,#1975,Friedrich 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Measurement Invariance Across Gender on the Second-Order Five-Factor Model of the German Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition,"Pauls, F.; Daseking, M.; Petermann, F.","The present study investigated measurement invariance across gender on the German Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V). The higher order model that was preferred by the test publishers was tested on a population-representative German sample of 1,411 children and adolescents aged between 6 and 16 years. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to test for measurement invariance. As soon as partial scalar invariance could be established by freeing nonequivalent subtest intercepts, results demonstrated that 11 out of 15 subtest scores have the same meaning for male and female children. These findings support interpretable comparisons of the WISC-V test scores between males and females but only in due consideration of partial scalar invariance and with respect to the underlying factor structure. Despite this, however, results did not support the overall structural validity of the higher order model. Thus, replacing the former Perceptual Reasoning factor by Fluid Reasoning and Visual Spatial may be considered inappropriate due to the redundancy of the FRI as a separate factor. Results also indicated that the WISC-V provides stronger measurement of general intelligence (Full Scale IQ) than measurements of cognitive subdomains (WISC-V indexes).

The link between daily stress and intensity of Facebook use was negatively moderated by perceived offline social support, indicating that individuals who received low levels of support offline were particularly likely to increase their Facebook use at higher levels of daily stress. Perceived online social support partly mediated the positive relationship between Facebook use intensity and tendencies towards FAD. It is remarkable that Facebook use intensity is systematically related to both positive (i.e., receiving online social support) and negative (i.e., building up FAD) consequences. Thereby, individuals who receive high levels of social support online tend to be at risk for tendencies towards FAD.

N2 amplitudes in incompatible trials increased with higher conflict frequency, while postresponse CRN amplitudes decreased. In concert with behavioral findings of reduced conflict costs and greater interference suppression, the increase of N2 might reflect enhanced conflict resolution during stimulus processing. The CRN, however, might reflect postresponse implementation of cognitive control, which is reduced when conflict is already adequately resolved during stimulus processing.

Desire lies in the eyes: attention bias for chocolate is related to craving and self-endorsed eating permission,"Werthmann, J.; Roefs, A.; Nederkoorn, C.; Jansen, A.","The present study tested the impact of experimentally manipulated perceived availability of chocolate on attention for chocolate stimuli, momentary (state) craving for chocolate and consumption of chocolate in healthy weight female students. It was hypothesized that eating forbiddance would be related to attentional avoidance (thus diminished attention focus on food cues in an attempt to prevent oneself from processing food cues) and that eating motivation would be related to attentional approach (thus maintained attentional focus on food cues). High chronic chocolate cravers (n=40) and low cravers (n=40) participated in one of four perceived availability contexts (required to eat, forbidden to eat, individual choice to eat, and 50% chance to eat) following a brief chocolate exposure. Attention for chocolate was measured using eye-tracking; momentary craving from self-report; and the consumption of chocolate was assessed from direct observation. The perceived availability of chocolate did not significantly influence attention allocation for chocolate stimuli, momentary craving or chocolate intake. High chocolate cravers reported significantly higher momentary craving for chocolate (d=1.29, p<.001), and showed longer initial duration of gaze on chocolate, than low cravers (d=0.63, p<.01).

"Relapses in recurrent depression 1 year after maintenance cognitive-behavioral therapy: the role of therapist adherence, competence, and the therapeutic alliance","Weck, F.; Rudari, V.; Hilling, C.; Hautzinger, M.; Heidenreich, T.; Schermelleh-Engel, K.; Stangier, U.","The prevention of relapse in recurrent depression is considered a central aim in cognitive-behavioral therapy, given the high risk of relapse. In this study, patients with recurrent major depressive disorder (currently remitted) received 16 sessions of Maintenance Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (M-CBT) over a period of 8 months, in order to prevent relapse. Therapist adherence and competence, as well as the therapeutic alliance, were investigated as predictors for reducing the risk of recurrence in depression. Videotapes of 80 participants were analyzed in order to evaluate therapist adherence and competence. Additionally, the therapeutic alliance was assessed by questionnaire. No associations were found between therapist adherence or competence, and the risk of relapse 1 year after treatment. By contrast, the therapeutic alliance was a significant predictor of the time to relapse. Moreover, we found that the number of previous depressive episodes (>/= 5 vs. </= 4) was a significant moderator variable. This indicates that the alliance-outcome relationship was particularly important when patients with five or more previous depressive episodes were taken into account, in comparison to patients with four or fewer episodes. For the psychotherapeutic treatment of recurrent depression and the prevention of relapse, sufficient attention should be paid to the therapeutic alliance.",2013,Nov 30,Psychiatry Res,210,1,140-5,23806623.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2013.05.036,,#1987,Weck 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Genetic variation is associated with PTSD risk and aversive memory: Evidence from two trauma-Exposed African samples and one healthy European sample,"Wilker, S.; Schneider, A.; Conrad, D.; Pfeiffer, A.; Boeck, C.; Lingenfelder, B.; Freytag, V.; Vukojevic, V.; Vogler, C.; Milnik, A.; Papassotiropoulos, A.; J. F. de Quervain D; Elbert, T.; Kolassa, S.; Kolassa, I. T.","The probability to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by vivid, intrusive emotional memories of the encountered traumatic events, depends - among other factors - on the number of previous traumatic experiences (traumatic load) and individual genetic vulnerability. So far, our knowledge regarding the biological underpinnings of PTSD is relatively sparse. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) followed by independent replication might help to discover novel, so far unknown biological mechanisms associated with the development of traumatic memories. Here, a GWAS was conducted in N = 924 Northern Ugandan rebel war survivors and identified seven suggestively significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; p </= 1 x 10(-5)) for lifetime PTSD risk. Of these seven SNPs, the association of rs3852144 on chromosome 5 was replicated in an independent sample of Rwandan genocide survivors (N = 370, p < .01). While PTSD risk increased with accumulating traumatic experiences, the vulnerability was reduced in carriers of the minor G-allele in an additive manner. Correspondingly, memory for aversive pictures decreased with higher number of the minor G-allele in a sample of N = 2698 healthy Swiss individuals. Finally, investigations on N = 90 PTSD patients treated with Narrative Exposure Therapy indicated an additive effect of genotype on PTSD symptom change from pre-treatment to four months after treatment, but not between pre-treatment and the 10-months follow-up. In conclusion, emotional memory formation seems to decline with increasing number of rs3852144 G-alleles, rendering individuals more resilient to PTSD development. However, the impact on therapy outcome remains preliminary and further research is needed to determine how this intronic marker may affect memory processes in detail.",2018,Nov 22,Transl Psychiatry,8,1,251,30467376.0,10.1038/s41398-018-0297-1,,#1988,Wilker 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Changes in interoceptive processes following brain stimulation,"Pollatos, O.; Herbert, B. M.; Mai, S.; Kammer, T.","The processing and perception of individual internal bodily signals (interoception) has been differentiated to comprise different levels and processes involved. The so-called heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) offers an additional possibility to examine automatic processing of cardiac signals. Knowledge on neural structures potentially supporting different facets of interoception is still sparse. One way to get insights into neuroanatomical function is to manipulate the activity of different brain structures. In this study, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and a continuous theta-burst protocol to inhibit specific central locations of the interoceptive network including the right anterior insula and the right somatosensory cortices and assessed effects on interoceptive facets and the HEP in 18 male participants. Main results were that inhibiting anterior insula resulted in a significant decline in cardiac and respiratory interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and in a consistent decrease in perception confidence. Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over somatosensory cortices reduced only cardiac IAc and affected perception confidence. Inhibiting right anterior insula and right somatosensory cortices increased interoceptive sensibility and reduced the HEP amplitude over frontocentral locations. Our findings strongly suggest that cTBS is an effective tool to investigate the neural network supporting interoceptive processes.This article is part of the themed issue 'Interoception beyond homeostasis: affect, cognition and mental health'.",2016,Nov 19,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,371,1708,20160016,28080973.0,10.1098/rstb.2016.0016,,#1989,Pollatos 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
[Psychological Distress and Acceptance of Violence Legitimizing Masculinity Norms among Adolescents],"Klein, E. M.; Wolfling, K.; Beutel, M. E.; Dreier, M.; Muller, K. W.","The proportion of adolescent migrants in Germany aged 15-20 years has risen to about 29.5% in 2014 according to Federal census statistics. The purpose of the current study was to describe and to compare the psychological strains of adolescent 1(st) and 2(nd) generation migrants with non-migrants in a representative school survey. Acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity norms was explored and its correlation with psychological strain was analyzed. Self-reported data of psychological strain (internalizing and externalizing problems) and acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity were gathered among 8 518 pupils aged 12-19 years across different school types. Among the surveyed adolescents, 27.6% reported a migration background (5.8% 1(st) generation migrants; 21.8% 2(nd) generation migrants). Particularly 1(st) generation migrants scored higher in internalizing and externalizing problems than 2(nd) generation migrants or non-migrants. The differences, however, were small. Adolescents with migration background suffered from educational disadvantage, especially 1(st) generation migrants. Male adolescents reported significantly higher acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity norms than their female counterparts. Strong agreement with the measured concept of masculinity was found among pupils of lower secondary school and adolescents reported regularly tobacco and cannabis consumption. The acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity norms was greater among migrants, particularly 1(st) generation migrants, than non-migrants. Overall, high acceptance of violence legitimizing masculinity norms was related to externalizing problems, which can be understood as dysfunctional coping mechanisms of social disadvantage and a lack of prospects.",2017,Apr,Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol,67,3-04,152-160,28147409.0,10.1055/s-0042-115932,,#1990,Klein 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Public stigma towards prolonged grief disorder: Does diagnostic labeling matter?,"Gonschor, J.; Eisma, M. C.; Barke, A.; Doering, B. K.","The recent introduction of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) as a diagnostic category may cause negative social reactions (i.e. public stigma). Vignette experiments demonstrate that persons with both PGD symptoms and a PGD diagnosis elicit more public stigma than persons who experience integrated grief. However, the strength of the influence of the diagnosis itself remains unclear: We aimed to clarify if the diagnostic label PGD produces additional public stigma beyond PGD symptoms. We further compared whether public stigma varies between the label PGD and the label major depressive episode (MDE) (when PGD symptoms are present) and if gender of the bereaved person influences public stigma or moderates the aforementioned effects. Eight-hundred fifty-two participants (77% female; Mage = 32.6 years, SD = 13.3) were randomly assigned to read online one of eight vignettes describing either a bereaved male or female, with PGD symptoms and PGD diagnosis; PGD symptoms and MDE diagnosis; PGD symptoms and no diagnosis, or no PGD symptoms and no diagnosis (i.e., integrated grief). Following the vignettes, participants indicated which negative characteristics they ascribed to the person, their emotional reactions, and preferred social distance from the person. People with PGD symptoms and PGD (or MDE) diagnosis were attributed more negative characteristics, and elicited more negative emotions and a stronger desire for social distance than people with integrated grief. However, public stigma did not differ for people with both PGD symptoms and diagnosis compared to people only experiencing PGD symptoms. Gender of the bereaved only had an influence on desired social distance, which was larger towards men. Helping severely distressed bereaved people (regardless of diagnostic status) cope with negative social reactions may help them adapt to bereavement. Results demonstrate that the experience of severe grief reactions, yet not a diagnostic label per se, causes public stigma.",2020,2020/09/11,PLOS ONE,15,9,e0237021,32915800.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0237021,,#1997,Gonschor 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

J.; Buhlmann, U.; Svaldi, J.; Vocks, S.","The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has plunged countries across the world into crisis. Both in the general population and in specific subgroups such as infected people or health care workers, studies have reported increased symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress. However, the reactions of individuals with mental disorders to Covid-19 have largely been neglected. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the perceived impact of Covid-19 and its psychological consequences on people with mental disorders. In this online survey, participants were asked to evaluate their disorder-specific symptoms, perceived psychosocial stress and behaviors related to Covid-19 in the current situation and retrospectively before the spread of Covid-19. The study included participants with self-identified generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder and agoraphobia (PA), illness anxiety disorder (IA), social anxiety disorder (SAD), depression (DP), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders (ED), schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (SP), other non-specified mental disorder (other) as well as mentally healthy controls (HC). The results of bayesian parameter estimation suggest that the symptom severity of DP, GAD, IA and BDD has deteriorated as a reaction to Covid-19. Across all mental disorders and HC, self-reported psychosocial stress levels were higher during the outbreak of Covid-19 compared to before. A reduced frequency of social contacts and grocery shopping was found for all participants. People with self-identified mental disorders showed higher personal worries about Covid-19 and a higher fear of contagion with Covid-19 than did HC.

We also characterized all subjects with an extensive test battery from which a cognitive, affective, and social functioning factor was constructed. These factors were subsequently related to functional responses in the ventral striatum (vST) and neural networks linked to it. We found that blunted vST responses were present in SZ, BP, and ASD but not in MD. Activation within the vST predicted individual differences in affective, cognitive, and social functioning across diagnostic boundaries. Network alterations extended beyond the reward network to include regions implicated in executive control. We further confirmed the robustness of our results in various control analyses. Our findings suggest that altered brain responses during reward anticipation show transdiagnostic alterations that can be mapped onto dimensional measures of functioning.

This study investigated whether patients with highly fearful chronic low back pain show distinct physiological reaction patterns compared with less fearful patients when anticipating aversive back pain-related movements. We used an idiosyncratic fear induction paradigm and collected 2 different measures of autonomic nervous system activation and muscle tension in the lower back. We identified 2 distinct psychophysiological response patterns. One pattern was characterized by a moderate increase in skin conductance, interbeat interval (IBI) increase, and muscle tension increase in the lower back. This response was interpreted as an attention reaction to a moderately stressful event. The other pattern, found in 58% of the participants, was characterized by a higher skin conductance response, IBI decrease, and muscle tension increase in the lower back. According to Bradley and Lang defense cascade model, this response is typical of a fear reaction. Participants showing the psychophysiological pattern typical of fear also had elevated scores on some self-report measures of components of the fear-avoidance model, relative to participants showing the reaction pattern characteristic of attention.

C.; Silk, J. S.","The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project's success rests on the assumption that constructs and data can be integrated across units of analysis and developmental stages. We adopted a psychoneurometric approach to establish biobehavioral liability models of sensitivity to social threat, a key component of potential threat that is particularly salient to the development of adolescent affective psychopathology. Models were derived from measures across four units of analysis in a community sample (n = 129) of 11- to 13-year-old girls oversampled for shy/fearful temperament. To test the ecological validity of derived factors, they were then related to real-world socioaffective processes in peer interactions over a 16-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol. Our results indicate that measures (i.e., amygdala reactivity to negative social feedback, eye-tracking bias toward social threat, parent- and adolescent-reports of social threat sensitivity) formed unit-specific factors, rather than one unified factor. These findings suggest that these factors were largely unrelated. Amygdala response to social punishment and attention bias toward threatening faces predicted real-world experiences with peers, suggesting that vigilance toward potentially threatening social information could be a mechanism through which vulnerable youth come to experience their peer interactions more negatively.

Recent reports suggest that better face recognition abilities coincide with a weaker reliance on shape information for face recognition. We examined contributions of second-order configuration to familiar face repetition priming by manipulating metric distances between facial features. S1 comprised familiar face primes as either: unaltered, with increased or decreased interocular distance, with increased or decreased distance between nose and mouth; or a different familiar face (unprimed). Participants performed a familiarity decision task on familiar and unfamiliar S2 targets, and completed a test battery consisting of three face identity processing tests. Accuracies, reaction times, and inverse efficiency scores were assessed for the priming experiment, and potential priming costs in inverse efficiency scores were correlated with test battery scores. Overall, priming was found, and priming effects were reduced only by primes with interocular distance distortions. Correlational data showed that better face recognition skills coincided with a weaker reliance on second-order configurations.

Simultaneous EEG-fMRI reveals attention-dependent coupling of early face processing with a distributed cortical network,"Bayer, M.; Rubens, M. T.; Johnstone, T.","The speed of visual processing is central to our understanding of face perception. Yet the extent to which early visual processing influences later processing in distributed face processing networks, and the top-down modulation of such bottom-up effects, remains unclear. We used simultaneous EEG-fMRI to investigate cortical activity that showed unique covariation with ERP components of face processing (C1, P1, N170, P3), while manipulating sustained attention and transient cognitive conflict employing an emotional face-word Stroop task. ERP markers of visual processing within 100 ms after stimulus onset showed covariation with brain activation in precuneous, posterior cingulate gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus and frontal operculum, and a left lateral parietal-occipital cluster, illustrating the impact of early stage processing on higher-order mechanisms. Crucially, this covariation depended on sustained attentional focus and was absent for incongruent trials, suggesting flexible top-down gating of bottom-up processing.",2018,Feb,Biol Psychol,132,,133-142,29246813.0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2017.12.002,,#2007,Bayer 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Purchasing under threat: Changes in shopping patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Schmidt, S.; Benke, C.; Pane-Farre, C. A.","The spreading of COVID-19 has led to panic buying all over the world. In this study, we applied an animal model framework to elucidate changes in human purchasing behavior under COVID-19 pandemic conditions. Purchasing behavior and potential predictors were assessed in an online questionnaire format (N = 813). Multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate the role of individually Perceived Threat of COVID-19, anxiety related personality traits (trait-anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty) and the role of media exposure in predicting quantity and frequency of purchasing behavior. High levels of Perceived Threat of COVID-19 were associated significantly with a reported reduction in purchasing frequency (b = -.24, p < .001) and an increase in the quantity of products bought per purchase (b = .22, p < .001). These results are comparable to observed changes in foraging behavior in rodents under threat conditions. Higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty (b = .19, p < .001) and high extend of media exposure (b = .27, p < .001) were positively associated with Perceived Threat of COVID-19 and an increase in purchasing quantity.

Preschoolers' Sensitivity to Negative and Positive Emotional Facial Expressions: An ERP Study,"Naumann, S.; Bayer, M.; Dziobek, I.","The study examined processing differences for facial expressions (happy, angry, or neutral) and their repetition with early (P1, N170) and late (P3) event-related potentials (ERPs) in young children (N = 33). EEG was recorded while children observed sequentially presented pairs of facial expressions, which were either the same (repeated trials) or differed in their emotion (novel trials). We also correlated ERP amplitude differences with parental and child measures of socio-emotional competence (emotion recognition, empathy). P1 amplitudes were increased for angry and happy as compared to neutral expressions. We also detected larger P3 amplitudes for angry expressions as compared to happy or neutral expressions. Repetition effects were evident at early and late processing stages marked by reduced P1 amplitudes for repeated vs. novel happy expressions, but enhanced P3 amplitudes for repeated vs. novel facial expressions. N170 amplitudes were neither modulated by facial expressions nor their repetition. None of the repetition effects were associated with measures of socio-emotional competence. Taken together, negative facial expressions led to increased neural activations in early and later processing stages, indicative of enhanced saliency to potential threating stimuli in young children. Processing of repeated facial expression seem to be differential for early and late neural stages: Reduced activation was detected at early neural processing stages particularly for happy faces, indicative of effective processing for an emotion, which is most familiar within this age range. Contrary to our hypothesis, enhanced activity for repeated vs. novel expression independent of a particular emotion were detected at later processing stages, which may be linked to the creation of new memory traces.

Skilled readers show different serial-position effects for letter versus non-letter target detection in mixed-material strings,"Schmitt, A.; Lachmann, T.","The study explored whether target detection in a five-character string depends on whether a letter or a non-letter was presented, as a predesignated target. Skilled readers had to identify a single letter or non-letter in a five-character string, randomly composed of letters and non-letters. It was found that an analytic processing strategy is automatically elicited if participants were instructed to detect a letter target. In this instance, a linear model best explained the RT variance for letters: with increasing RTs from left to right, suggesting a serial item-by-item reading-specific strategy comparable to alphabetic reading. For non-letters, in contrast, a symmetrical U-shaped function best explained the RT variance, suggesting a symmetrical scanning-out from the central to the terminal positions of the string. Since the design precludes orthographic and semantic influences, it can be concluded that a reading-specific strategy for alphabetic processing is automatically activated if the string is scanned for a letter-target. Thus, the pre-designated target triggers the strategy for processing the string and determines related position effects. The results suggest that effects from earlier studies, which showed an analytic processing preference for isolated letters (APPLE) in recognition tasks, as a consequence of literacy acquisition, generalize to the processing of letters in strings.",2020,Mar,Acta Psychol (Amst),204,,103025,32088389.0,10.1016/j.actpsy.2020.103025,,#2014,Schmitt 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
International standardisation of the test of masticating and swallowing solids in children,"Frank, U.; van den Engel-Hoek, L.; Nogueira, D.; Schindler, A.; Adams, S.; Curry, M.; Huckabee, M. L.","The Test of Masticating and Swallowing Solids (TOMASS) is a validated assessment tool measuring the efficiency of solid bolus intake by four quantitative parameters: discrete bites, masticatory cycles, swallows and time to ingest a single cracker.

The objective of this study was to investigate the applicability and reliability of the TOMASS in children and adolescents (TOMASS-C) and to establish the normative database for this younger population. We collected data from 638 participants (male: 311, female: 327) in five age groups (4-18 years) with five different but very similar test crackers in four countries. Significant effects of bolus type (cracker), age group and gender on the TOMASS parameters were identified, requiring stratification of the TOMASS-C database by these variables.

Neural correlates of a standardized version of the trail making test in young and elderly adults: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study,"Muller, L. D.; Guhn, A.; Zeller, J. B.; Biehl, S.

However, due to its paper-and-pencil nature it is difficult to adapt for functional brain imaging. Related neural underpinnings even in healthy aging are mostly unknown since no consistent administration for imaging is available. In this study a standardized implementation of the TMT for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is proposed to investigate associated frontal cortex activation in healthy young (mean age 25.7 +/- 3.02 years) and elderly adults (mean age 70.95 +/- 3.55 years). The TMT consisted of a number condition (TMT-A), an alternating number and letter condition (TMT-B) as well as a control task. Behavioral results demonstrated that elderly participants performed slower but committed a similar number of errors compared to younger adults. The fNIRS results showed that particularly the TMT-B provoked bilateral activation in the ventro- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC and dlPFC) as well as in premotor regions. Elderly participants displayed more significantly activated channels and a different activation pattern compared to younger participants especially manifesting in more bilateral dlPFC activation. In line with the hemispheric asymmetry reduction in elderly adults (HAROLD) model, the results were interpreted as an additional need for cognitive control resources in elderly participants. This study succeeded in implementing an appropriate version of the TMT for fNIRS and helps elucidating neural aging effects associated with this task.",2014,Apr,Neuropsychologia,56,,271-9,24524911.0,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.01.019,,#2018,Muller 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Craving in alcohol-dependent patients after detoxification is related to glutamatergic dysfunction in the nucleus accumbens and the anterior cingulate cortex,"Bauer, J.; Pedersen, A.; Scherbaum, N.; Bening, J.; Patschke, J.; Kugel, H.; Heindel, W.; Arolt, V.; Ohrmann, P.","The upregulation of glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission is thought to be partly responsible for the acute withdrawal symptoms and craving experienced by alcohol-dependent patients. Most physiological evidence supporting this hypothesis is based on data from animal studies. In addition, clinical data show that GABAergic and anti-glutamatergic drugs ameliorate withdrawal symptoms, offering indirect evidence indicative of glutamatergic hyperexcitability in alcohol-dependent subjects. We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify the glutamate (Glu) levels in healthy control subjects and in alcohol-dependent patients immediately after detoxification. The volumes of interest were located in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which are two brain areas that have important functions in reward circuitry. In addition to Glu, we quantified the levels of combined Glu and glutamine (Gln), N-acetylaspartate, choline-containing compounds, and creatine. The Glu levels in the NAcc were significantly higher in patients than in controls. Craving, which was measured using the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale, correlated positively with levels of combined Glu and Gln in the NAcc and in the ACC. The levels of all other metabolites were not significantly different between patients and controls. The increased Glu levels in the NAcc in alcohol-dependent patients shortly after detoxification confirm the animal data and suggest that striatal glutamatergic dysfunction is related to ethanol withdrawal. The positive correlation between craving and glutamatergic metabolism in both key reward circuitry areas support the hypothesis that the glutamatergic system has an important role in the later course of alcohol dependence with respect to abstinence and relapse.",2013,Jul,Neuropsychopharmacology,38,8,1401-8,23403696.0,10.1038/npp.2013.45,,#2020,Bauer 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Heart rate variability as an index of emotion (dys)regulation in psychosis?,"Clamor, A.; Ludwig, L.; Lincoln, T. M.","The vagally-mediated heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), has been proposed as a transdiagnostic marker for emotion regulation (ER). In people with psychotic disorders (PSY), HRV is profoundly reduced compared to healthy controls (HC). Similarly, questionnaire-based assessments of adaptive ER point to a deficit in PSY. To address HRV as a potential marker for ER in psychosis, we investigated a large sample including PSY (n = 40) and HC (n = 32) as well as vulnerable (n = 19 clinical high-risk) and clinical (n = 28 anxiety disorders) controls. We tested the differential effectiveness of an instructed adaptive ER strategy, whether resting-state HRV predicts adaptive ER, and whether HRV serves as a state index of ER effort. The participants repeatedly played a social exclusion ballgame while they applied either cognitive reappraisal or no regulation (""just-play"") in randomized order. PSY displayed overall higher levels of negative affect and paranoia than HC but both groups applied reappraisal successfully (i.e., more benefit: lower negative affect and paranoia after reappraisal compared to ""just-play""). Resting-state HRV did not predict successful reappraisal in the total sample. However, within PSY, a higher resting-state HRV predicted more benefit from reappraisal. State HRV did not differ between the reappraisal and ""just-play"" condition. Contrary to our expectations, participants with psychosis applied an instructed adaptive ER strategy successfully. As expected, the ANS marker of HRV predicted that benefit; however, this was only the case in PSY. Overall, HRV was not a robust but a tentative marker of ER in the present investigation.",2020,Dec,Int J Psychophysiol,158,,310-317,33075434.0,10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2020.08.016,,#2022,Clamor 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) is elicited with para-foveal hemifield oddball stimulation: An event-related brain potential (ERP) study,"Berti, S.","The visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) is a component of the human event-related brain potential (ERP) that indicates the automatic processing and detection of changes in the visual sensory input. The study tested whether the vMMN was observable when the visual input is restricted to one visual hemifield and, with this, only para-foveal input to one of the two primary sensory cortices in the visual system is available for stimulus processing. The vMMN was elicited by the stimulation restricted to a small portion of the visual field. This demonstrates that in general vMMN elicitation is not confined to stimulations covering a broad range of the visual field or to the propagation of sensory information to both sensory visual cortices. In addition, the vMMN amplitudes showed a high variability between the different conditions, including non-significant vMMN amplitudes.

The evolution of patients' concept of the alliance and its relation to outcome: A dynamic latent-class structural equation modeling approach,"Fluckiger, C.; Horvath, A. O.; Brandt, H.","The working alliance (WA) has been widely identified as the key concept for psychotherapy and allied health care services. The WA, measured at different phases of diverse kinds of therapies, has been shown to robustly predict posttreatment outcomes. But the way the clients' conceptualization of the alliance evolves overtime, and the relation between this kind of conceptual change and subsequent symptom improvements, has not been investigated. Dynamic Latent Class Structural Equation Models (DLC-SEM) were applied to data drawn from two randomized clinical trials of cognitive-behavioral therapy for generalized anxiety disorder (N = 57 and 80) to evaluate several potential models of the relation between the conceptual/structural changes in patients' self-reports of the quality of the alliance and subsequent treatment outcomes. Inspection of the DLC-SEM models suggests that, overtime, between 63% and 66% of the better session-level outcome clients switched from three factors (task, goal, bond) to an integrated single factor conceptualization of the therapeutic alliance. The study indicates that the majority of patients evolve their concept of the alliance overtime: The previously distinct alliance elements become integrated into a single factor construct. These findings suggest that if such overtime development is generalizable across diverse patient/treatment populations, future research ought to take these developments into account both methodologically (i.e., how alliance is measured) and in analyzing time-series data (e.g., using DLC-SEM). By modeling the patient's dynamic concept evolution, this initial study shows a potential to empirically explore prior theoretical propositions of the evolutions (or stability) of the alliance overtime.

Effects of Group-Based CBT on Post-Event Processing in Children with Social Anxiety Disorder Following an Experimental Social Stressor,"Asbrand, J.; Schmitz, J.; Kramer, M.; Nitschke, K.; Heinrichs, N.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.","Theoretical models and previous research suggest that post-event processing (PEP) after social situations maintains social anxiety disorder (SAD). To date, little is known about PEP in childhood, a critical period for disorder development, or about possible positive effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on PEP in children. Children with SAD (n = 71; aged 9-13 years) and healthy controls (n = 55) participated in a social stress task (Trier Social Stress Test for Children, TSST-C), which was repeated in children with SAD after either 12 sessions of CBT or a waiting period. PEP was assessed daily with regard to both valence and frequency, as well as in more detail regarding specific negative and positive ruminative thoughts 1 week after each TSST-C. Daily PEP after the TSST-C was more frequent and more negative in children with SAD compared to healthy controls, in particular during the first 2 days after the TSST-C. After CBT treatment, children with SAD reported more positive PEP but not less negative PEP compared to children in the waitlist control group. The current study suggests that negative PEP in children with SAD is most pronounced in the first days following social stress. Group-based CBT seems to be effective in building up positive cognitions after social stress in children, but developing specific interventions targeting negative PEP immediately after a social stressor may be necessary to further increase treatment efficacy.",2019,Dec,J Abnorm Child Psychol,47,12,1945-1956,31073879.0,10.1007/s10802-019-00558-x,,#2029,Asbrand 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

In order to overcome these limitations of previous studies, the present study investigated specific ER difficulties in 120 patients with different ED subtypes, including AN-R, AN-BP, bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED). As compared to 60 healthy normal-weight controls (NWC) and 29 healthy over-weight controls (OWC), all ED subtypes reported greater difficulties in ER. ED subtypes did not differ regarding most domains of ER except BED showing less severe ER difficulties in some domains. In addition, AN-BP but not BN reported greater impulse control difficulties than AN-R and BED. The findings underscore the relevance of ER difficulties in ED and support the trans-diagnostic view of ER difficulties being present across the whole spectrum of ED.

The main findings were an emotional flattening in subjective valences for affective stimuli after inhibition of the frontotemporal anterior insular network and of somatosensory cortices, being mirrored in visual evoked potentials as increased N2/decreased P3, indicating an initial orientation reaction followed by decreased attentional processing of positive stimuli. Moreover, cardiac and respiratory IAc were positively associated with P3 amplitudes and negatively related to positive valence ratings. Positive associations of decreases of cardiac/respiratory IAc with decreases of arousal ratings and decreases of P3 amplitudes for negative stimuli after inhibition of the frontotemporal insular network and after inhibition of somatosensory cortices allow the conclusion of a causal relationship between reduced activity in interoceptive network structures and blunted emotional processing of visual stimuli. Our results suggest that both arousal, and valence aspects of emotional processing are disturbed after inhibition of interoceptive network structures, confirming core assumptions of peripheral theories of emotions and models of interoceptive predictive coding.",2019,May 15,Neuroscience,406,,405-419,30880101.0,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.03.014,,#2032,Mai 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Can we differentiate between psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapy? - An empirical investigation of therapists' self-reports,"Henkel, M.; Huber, D.; Ratzek, M.; Benecke, C.; Klug, G.","Therapy differentiation is a crucial component of psychotherapy research. It refers to whether inspected treatments differ from one another. In the history of psychoanalysis, the differentiation between psychodynamic and analytic psychotherapy was often discussed but seldom inspected empirically. In this study, we propose a set of items which should in theory offer the possibility to differentiate between psychodynamic and analytic psychotherapy on session level. We inspect these items using therapists' self-reports concerning N = 295 cases of different psychodynamic and analytic therapies. Results of an exploratory factor analysis and subsequent inspections of the psychodynamic and analytic items in different forms of therapies strengthen the usability of these items for differentiating between psychodynamic and analytic therapy. However, further studies using different perspectives (e. g., observer ratings) are essential. The presented items are a promising step towards the development of an instrument for treatment differentiation which could later be used in treatment comparison studies.",2022,Dec,Z Psychosom Med Psychother,68,4,362-377,36511576.0,10.13109/zptm.2022.68.4.362,,#2033,Henkel 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Using network analysis for the prediction of treatment dropout in patients with mood and anxiety disorders: A methodological proof-of-concept study,"Lutz, W.; Schwartz, B.; Hofmann, S. G.; Fisher, A. J.; Husen, K.; Rubel, J. A.","There are large health, societal, and economic costs associated with attrition from psychological services. The recently emerged, innovative statistical tool of complex network analysis was used in the present proof-of-concept study to improve the prediction of attrition. Fifty-eight patients undergoing psychological treatment for mood or anxiety disorders were assessed using Ecological Momentary Assessments four times a day for two weeks before treatment (3,248 measurements). Multilevel vector autoregressive models were employed to compute dynamic symptom networks. Intake variables and network parameters (centrality measures) were used as predictors for dropout using machine-learning algorithms. Networks for patients differed significantly between completers and dropouts. Among intake variables, initial impairment and sex predicted dropout explaining 6% of the variance. The network analysis identified four additional predictors: Expected force of being excited, outstrength of experiencing social support, betweenness of feeling nervous, and instrength of being active. The final model with the two intake and four network variables explained 32% of variance in dropout and identified 47 out of 58 patients correctly. The findings indicate that patients' dynamic network structures may improve the prediction of dropout. When implemented in routine care, such prediction models could identify patients at risk for attrition and inform personalized treatment recommendations.",2018,May 18,Sci Rep,8,1,7819,29777110.0,10.1038/s41598-018-25953-0,,#2035,Lutz 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
The individual therapy process questionnaire: development and validation of a revised measure to evaluate general change mechanisms in psychotherapy,"Mander, J.","There is a dearth of measures specifically designed to assess empirically validated mechanisms of therapeutic change. To fill in this research gap, the aim of the current study was to develop a measure that covers a large variety of empirically validated mechanisms of change with corresponding versions for the patient and therapist. To develop an instrument that is based on several important change process frameworks, we combined two established change mechanisms instruments: the Scale for the Multiperspective Assessment of General Change Mechanisms in Psychotherapy (SACiP) and the Scale of the Therapeutic Alliance-Revised (STA-R). In our study, 457 psychosomatic inpatients completed the SACiP and the STA-R and diverse outcome measures in early, middle and late stages of psychotherapy. Data analyses were conducted using factor analyses and multilevel modelling. The psychometric properties of the resulting Individual Therapy Process Questionnaire were generally good to excellent, as demonstrated by (a) exploratory factor analyses on both patient and therapist ratings, (b) CFA on later measuring times, (c) high internal consistencies and (d) significant outcome predictive effects. The parallel forms of the ITPQ deliver opportunities to compare the patient and therapist perspectives for a broader range of facets of change mechanisms than was hitherto possible. Consequently, the measure can be applied in future research to more specifically analyse different change mechanism profiles in session-to-session development and outcome prediction. Key Practitioner Message This article describes the development of an instrument that measures general mechanisms of change in psychotherapy from both the patient and therapist perspectives. Post-session item ratings from both the patient and therapist can be used as feedback to optimize therapeutic processes. We provide a detailed discussion of measures developed to evaluate therapeutic change mechanisms.",2015,Jul-Aug,Clin Psychol Psychother,22,4,328-45,24604874.0,10.1002/cpp.1892,,#2036,Mander 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Investigation of implicit avoidance of displacement-related stimuli in offspring of trauma exposed, forcibly-displaced individuals","Wittekind, C. E.; Muhtz, C.; Moritz, S.; Jelinek, L.","There is an ongoing debate as to whether traumatization also affects the close relatives of trauma survivors who have symptoms of PTSD. Although many studies provide evidence favoring a transgenerational transmission, other studies have not found evidence to support this idea. The present study examined whether adult offspring of individuals exposed to trauma during forced displacement with (n=22) and without PTSD (n=24) exhibit an implicit avoidance of stimuli related to the parental trauma compared to children of non-trauma exposed control participants (n=23) using an Approach-Avoidance task (AAT). Offspring participants were requested to push (i.e., avoidance) or pull (i.e., approach) displacement-related and neutral pictures, whereby response direction depended on a non-affective dimension (color of the pictures). Results suggest that the offspring of non-PTSD participants exhibit implicit avoidance of displacement-related stimuli. This rather unexpected finding might either indicate resilience amongst offspring of PTSD participants or that offspring of non-PTSD participants are particularly affected. If these results were to replicate, they suggest that implicit avoidance tendencies amongst the offspring of trauma exposed participants might partially contribute to their heightened PTSD vulnerability. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate whether implicit avoidance tendencies are associated with increased stress vulnerability.",2017,Apr,J Anxiety Disord,47,,21-28,28196348.0,10.1016/j.janxdis.2017.02.002,,#2037,Wittekind 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Lower Emotion Regulation Competencies Mediate the Association between Impulsivity and Craving during Alcohol Withdrawal Treatment,"Reichl, D.; Enewoldsen, N.; Weisel, K.

To provide tailored interventions, a deeper understanding of the relation between IPTs and craving, namely mediating processes, is important. Based on previous literature, we proposed that lower emotion regulation competencies mediate the relation between attentional as well as non-planning IPTs and craving. To investigate these interrelations, we used data from the baseline assessment (n = 320) of the SmartAssistEntz project (pre-registered in the German Clinical Trials Register [DRKS00017700]). Inpatients with a primary AUD diagnosis were interviewed using standardized self-report measures (IPTs: BIS-15, emotion regulation competencies: ERSQ, craving: OCDS-G short version) during their withdrawal treatment. Indirect effects were calculated using the SPSS macro PROCESS v3.5. Attentional as well as non-planning, but not motor, IPTs were associated with craving. Emotion regulation competencies mediated the relationship between attentional as well as non-planning IPTs and craving. Given their mediating role in the present study, it is interesting to investigate if addressing emotion regulation competencies can mitigate the negative influences of attentional and non-planning IPTs. The direct effect of attentional IPTs implicates alternate mediating processes, which should also be investigated in future research.",2022,2022/02/10,Subst Use Misuse,57,4,649-655,35142599.0,10.1080/10826084.2022.2034878,,#2038,Reichl 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Cognitive bias modification in problem and pathological gambling using a web-based approach-avoidance task: A pilot trial,"Wittekind, C.

The aim of the present web-based study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of AppBM in reducing gambling-related symptoms. A self-selected sample of participants with problem/pathological slot-machine gambling completed an online survey and received either AppBM or Sham training (final N = 131). Attrition during study participation was high (66%). In both conditions slot-machine related and neutral pictures were presented. Within the AppBM condition all slot-machine related pictures had to be pushed and all neutral pictures had to be pulled, whereas in the Sham condition the contingency was 50:50. Eight weeks after baseline, participants were re-assessed. Both groups showed a similar reduction in gambling-related symptoms. Findings are at odds with the hypothesis claiming that only contingency trainings yield beneficial effects.

"Emotional Stress During Pregnancy - Associations With Maternal Anxiety Disorders, Infant Cortisol Reactivity, and Mother-Child Interaction at Pre-school Age","Zietlow, A. L.; Nonnenmacher, N.; Reck, C.; Ditzen, B.; Muller, M.","There is growing evidence that even milder forms of maternal stress or anxiety during pregnancy affect the fetus causing possible long-term consequences for infant and child development. The mechanisms through which prenatal maternal stress may affect the unborn are not yet entirely clarified. Due to limited self-regulatory skills after birth, infants depend on sensitive behavior of their parents to regulate affective states and physiological arousal. Dyadic affect regulation has been linked to various developmental patterns up to adolescence and thereby represents a key element of early social relationships. Aim of the study was to evaluate possible long-term consequences of emotional stress during pregnancy and postpartum anxiety disorders, as well as infant postpartum cortisol reactivity on mother-child-interaction at pre-school age. The sample comprised of N = 63 mother-infant dyads at study entry, n = 28 diagnosed with postpartum anxiety disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV), n = 35 were healthy controls. Mothers were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders at an average infant age of M = 4.1 months and filled out a questionnaire regarding emotional stress during pregnancy. Further, they were videotaped during the Face-to-Face-Still-Face paradigm (FFSF), a widely used mild socio-emotional stressor for infants. To determine infant stress-reactivity, infant salivary cortisol was collected before, immediately after and 20 min after the FFSF. Missing values were estimated by multiple imputations. At the age of M = 5.3 years, mother-child-interaction was re-assessed in a follow-up sample of n = 30 dyads via a free-play situation. Moreover, dimensional measures for anxiety were assessed. Mothers in the clinical group reported significantly higher stress scores than the control group. Infant stress reactivity in the early postpartum period and maternal anxiety symptoms at the 5-year follow-up assessment were significantly associated with dyadic interaction quality at pre-school age. Even though maternal stress during pregnancy did not directly predict mother-child interaction quality at pre-school age, it was significantly correlated with infant cortisol reactivity during postpartum period. Nevertheless, caution should be taken when interpreting the results considering the small sample size.",2019,2019/09/25,Front Psychol,10,,2179,31607996.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02179,,#2040,Zietlow 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Feeling lonely during the pandemic: Towards personality-tailored risk profiles,"Schemer, L.; Milde, C.; Lischetzke, T.; In-Albon, T.; Karbach, J.; Konen, T.; Glombiewski, J. A.","This is the first study to disentangle associations of within- and between-person fluctuations in loneliness and their effect on evening mood during a nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19. To contribute to the development of personality-tailored risk profiles, we additionally explored the moderating role of trait neuroticism and extraversion on the association of within- and between-person loneliness and mood. We employed an ambulatory assessment design during 21 days of nationwide lockdown in Germany (13/04/2020-03/05/2020) with two interval-based assessments. The final sample comprised 322 participants (74.5% women) aged between 15 and 82 years (M = 30.7, SD = 14.9) providing 6,084 evening assessments. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of within- and between-person fluctuations in loneliness on evening mood while controlling for unspecific effects of time, sex, and age. Moderation analysis was used to investigate the influence of neuroticism and extraversion on the relation between loneliness and mood, respectively. Results indicate that especially higher between-person loneliness (i.e. participants felt lonelier compared to the average participant) but also higher within-person loneliness (i.e. participants felt lonelier compared to their individual mean) were associated with a more unpleasant mood. Neuroticism augmented the effect of within-person loneliness, while extraversion seemed to buffer the effect of between-person loneliness on mood. Our findings underline the importance of carefully monitoring loneliness during COVID-19. The findings contribute towards the development of personality-tailored risk profiles (e.g. among newly arising risk groups for loneliness due to COVID-19).

Attention and interpretation biases were significantly correlated with anxiety. Mixed results were reported with regard to depression: evidence was found for an interpretation bias, and for an attention bias as measured with the EVST but not with the DPT. Furthermore, interpretation and attention biases predicted unique variance in anxiety and depression scores. These results indicate that attention and interpretation biases are unique processes in anxiety and depression.

One hundred and ninety-seven children aged 5 to 14 years completed a time-based PM task where working memory updating load was manipulated within individuals using a dual task design. Results revealed age-related increases in PM performance across childhood. Working memory updating load had a negative impact on PM performance and monitoring behavior in older children, but this effect was smaller in younger children. Moreover, the frequency as well as the pattern of time monitoring predicted children's PM performance. Our interpretation of these results is that processes involved in children's PM may show a qualitative shift over development from simple, nonstrategic monitoring behavior to more strategic monitoring based on internal temporal models that rely specifically on working memory updating resources.

TB and PB were associated with (passive/active) suicidal ideation, whereas the three-way interaction PB, TB, and H was not associated with active suicide ideation. Fearlessness about death in conjunction with active suicidal ideation was not associated with suicide intent and the interaction of PB, TB, and CS was neither predictive of recent suicide attempt status nor lifetime number of suicide attempts.

Facebook Addiction Disorder in Germany,"Brailovskaia, J.; Schillack, H.; Margraf, J.","This study explored the Facebook addiction disorder (FAD) in Germany. Of the 520 participants, 6.2 percent reached the critical polythetic cutoff score and 2.5 percent reached the critical monothetic cutoff score. FAD was significantly positively related to Facebook use frequency, the personality trait narcissism, as well as depression and anxiety symptoms, but also to subjective happiness. Its association with resilience was significantly negative. Furthermore, Facebook use frequency partly mediated the positive relationship between narcissism and FAD. Current results provide a first overview of FAD in Germany. They demonstrate that FAD is not only the consequence of excessive Facebook use. The positive relationship between FAD and happiness contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in the development and maintenance of FAD, and partly explains earlier inconsistencies. Practical applications for future studies and limitations of present results are discussed.",2018,Jul,Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw,21,7,450-456,29995531.0,10.1089/cyber.2018.0140,,#2062,Brailovskaia 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Association of parental characteristics and emotion regulation in children and adolescents with and without psychopathology: A case-control study,"Fassot, E. M.; Tuschen-Caffier, B.; Asbrand, J.","This study explores the difference in child emotion regulation (ER) and parenting between a heterogeneous clinical sample (ClinS) and a community sample (ComS). We hypothesized that parents of the ClinS would report more dysfunctional child ER and more dysfunctional parenting regarding the child's negative emotions than parents of the ComS. Further, we aimed to predict child ER by parenting behavior, parents' ER, and mental health. Parents of children and adolescents (aged 6-18 years) seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic were compared to a matched sample of parents in a ComS (n = 57 each group). As predicted, the children in the clinical group were reported to use less reappraisal and more suppression than ComS children. No difference was found in dysfunctional emotion parenting between the groups. Reappraisal in parents and supportive reactions to negative emotions predicted reappraisal in children. No predictor was found for child suppression. Child emotion regulation and parents' psychopathology were not associated. These results could suggest new elements for prevention and intervention programs with parents concerning their own emotion regulation and their reaction to negative emotions in children.",2022,2022/07/27,PLOS ONE,17,7,e0271486,35895666.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0271486,,#2063,Fassot 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Physical activity significantly moderated the positive relationship between depression symptoms and addictive SMU. The higher the physical activity, the weaker the link between depression symptoms and addictive tendencies. Depressed individuals often tend to intensive use of social media to escape negative mood and to find relief. This enhances their risk to develop addictive tendencies.

Rapid visuomotor processing of phobic images in spider- and snake-fearful participants,"Haberkamp, A.; Schmidt, F.; Schmidt, T.","This study investigates enhanced visuomotor processing of phobic compared to fear-relevant and neutral stimuli. We used a response priming design to measure rapid, automatic motor activation by natural images (spiders, snakes, mushrooms, and flowers) in spider-fearful, snake-fearful, and control participants. We found strong priming effects in all tasks and conditions; however, results showed marked differences between groups. Most importantly, in the group of spider-fearful individuals, spider pictures had a strong and specific influence on even the fastest motor responses: Phobic primes entailed the largest priming effects, and phobic targets accelerated responses, both effects indicating speeded response activation by phobic images. In snake-fearful participants, this processing enhancement for phobic material was less pronounced and extended to both snake and spider images. We conclude that spider phobia leads to enhanced processing capacity for phobic images.

Symptom outcome was assessed at post-treatment and at 1-year follow-up. The predictorxgroup interactions indicate that a longer duration of disorder predicted less improvement in negative symptoms in the CBTp but not in the wait-list group whereas jumping-to-conclusions was associated with poorer outcome only in the wait-list group. There were no CBTp specific predictors of improvement in positive symptoms. However, in the combined sample (immediate CBTp+the delayed CBTp group) baseline variables predicted significant amounts of positive and negative symptom variance at post-therapy and 1-year follow-up after controlling for pre-treatment symptoms. Lack of insight and low social functioning were the main predictors of drop-out, contributing to a prediction accuracy of 87%.

Main results showed that engaging in CR significantly reduced ERP amplitudes compared to the food watch condition.

Associative learning shapes visual discrimination in a web-based classical conditioning task,"Stegmann, Y.; Andreatta, M.; Pauli, P.; Wieser, M.

A fundamental function to improve threat detection is learning to differentiate between stimuli predicting danger and safety. Accordingly, aversive learning should lead to enhanced sensory discrimination of danger and safety cues. However, studies investigating the psychophysics of visual and auditory perception after aversive learning show divergent findings, and both enhanced and impaired discrimination after aversive learning have been reported. Therefore, the aim of this web-based study is to examine the impact of aversive learning on a continuous measure of visual discrimination. To this end, 205 participants underwent a differential fear conditioning paradigm before and after completing a visual discrimination task using differently oriented grating stimuli. Participants saw either unpleasant or neutral pictures as unconditioned stimuli (US). Results demonstrated sharpened visual discrimination for the US-associated stimulus (CS+), but not for the unpaired conditioned stimuli (CS-). Importantly, this finding was irrespective of the US's valence.

Patients more often wrongly identified anger, responded slower to all faces, and made faster saccades towards the eyes of briefly presented neutral faces and slower saccades away from fearful eyes compared with healthy volunteers. Latency of initial saccades and fixation duration correlated negatively with the patients' aggressiveness.

Threat induction biases processing of emotional expressions,"Flechsenhar, A.; Levine, S.; Bertsch, K.","Threats can derive from our physical or social surroundings and bias the way we perceive and interpret a given situation. They can be signaled by peers through facial expressions, as expressed anger or fear can represent the source of perceived threat. The current study seeks to investigate enhanced attentional state and defensive reflexes associated with contextual threat induced through aversive sounds presented in an emotion recognition paradigm. In a sample of 120 healthy participants, response and gaze behavior revealed differences in perceiving emotional facial expressions between threat and safety conditions: Responses were slower under threat and less accurate. Happy and neutral facial expressions were classified correctly more often in a safety context and misclassified more often as fearful under threat. This unidirectional misclassification suggests that threat applies a negative filter to the perception of neutral and positive information. Eye movements were initiated later under threat, but fixation changes were more frequent and dwell times shorter compared to a safety context. These findings demonstrate that such experimental paradigms are capable of providing insight into how context alters emotion processing at cognitive, physiological, and behavioral levels. Such alterations may derive from evolutionary adaptations necessary for biasing cognitive processing to survive disadvantageous situations.

Olfactory modulation of affective touch processing - A neurophysiological investigation,"Croy, I.; Drechsler, E.; Hamilton, P.; Hummel, T.; Olausson, H.","Touch can be highly emotional, and depending on the environment, it can be perceived as pleasant and comforting or disgusting and dangerous. Here, we studied the impact of context on the processing of tactile stimuli using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. This was achieved by embedding tactile stimulation in a variable olfactory environment. Twenty people were scanned with BOLD fMRI while receiving the following stimulus blocks: Slow stroking Touch, Civette odor (feces like), Rose odor, Touch+Civette, and Touch+Rose. Ratings of pleasantness and intensity of tactile stimuli and ratings of disgust and intensity of olfactory stimuli were collected. The impact of the olfactory context on the processing of touch was studied using covariance analyses. Coupling between olfactory processing and somatosensory processing areas was assessed with psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI). A subjectively disgusting olfactory environment significantly reduced the perceived pleasantness of touch. The touch fMRI activation in the secondary somatosensory cortex, operculum 1 (OP1), was positively correlated with the disgust towards the odors. Decreased pleasantness of touch was related to decreased posterior insula activity. PPI analysis revealed a significant interaction between the OP1, posterior insula, and regions processing the disgust of odors (orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala). We conclude that the disgust evaluation of the olfactory environment moderates neural reactivity in somatosensory regions by upregulation of the OP1 and downregulation of the posterior insula. This adaptive regulation of affective touch processing may facilitate adaptive reaction to a potentially harmful stimulus.",2016,Jul 15,NeuroImage,135,,135-41,27138206.0,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.04.046,,#2086,Croy 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

NE is suspected to contribute to generation of the P3 event-related potential. Recent evidence has produced equivocal evidence whether taVNS influences the P3 in healthy individuals during oddball tasks. We examined the effect of taVNS on P3 amplitudes using a novel visual Bayesian oddball task, which presented 200 sequences of three stimuli. The three consecutive stimuli in each sequence are labelled Draw 1, Draw 2 and Draw 3. In total, 47 Subjects completed this visual Bayesian oddball task under randomised sham and active taVNS stimulation in parallel with an electroencephalographic (EEG) recording. We conducted exploratory analyses of the effect of taVNS on P3 amplitudes separately for Draws. We found typical oddball effects on P3 amplitudes at Draws 1 and 2, but not Draw 3. At Draw 2, the oddball effect was enhanced during active compared to sham taVNS stimulation. These data provide evidence that taVNS influences parietal P3 amplitudes under specific circumstances.

Spatio-temporal associations with memory cues are linked to analogue traumatic intrusions,"Meyer, T.; Ikani, N.; Morina, N.","Trauma survivors with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently experience intrusive trauma memories associated with a feeling of ""nowness"". Information-processing models of PTSD ascribe these symptoms to an insufficient integration of memories with their spatio-temporal context in the past, turning them into powerful stressors. Here, we tested the idea that automatic associations of trauma reminders with the present or the past predict intrusive memories. We instructed 96 healthy participants to view two different traumatic films. Participants then underwent a computerized training that established implicit contingencies between film reminder pictures with the verbal responses ""now"" or ""past"" to increase and reduce intrusions, respectively. The training successfully altered implicit spatio-temporal associations for film reminder stimuli on a subsequent Implicit Association Test (IAT). There were no additional transfer effects for tense usage during a free recall task after one week and for the development of intrusion symptoms (one-week diary, retrospective questionnaire). However, participants who associated one film more strongly with the present and the other with the past consistently reported relatively more intrusive memories related to the former film. Thus, our results lend support to information processing models of PTSD and warrant further investigation of the causal role of implicit associations with spatio-temporal information.",2019,Dec,Behav Res Ther,123,,103481,31639528.0,10.1016/j.brat.2019.103481,,#2090,Meyer 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Uncertainty is associated with increased selective attention and sustained stimulus processing,"Dieterich, R.; Endrass, T.; Kathmann, N.","Uncertainty about future threat has been found to be associated with an overestimation of threat probability and is hypothesized to elicit additional allocation of attention. We used event-related potentials to examine uncertainty-related dynamics in attentional allocation, exploiting brain potentials' high temporal resolution and sensitivity to attention. Thirty participants performed a picture-viewing task in which cues indicated the subsequent picture valence. A certain-neutral and a certain-aversive cue accurately predicted subsequent picture valence, whereas an uncertain cue did not. Participants overestimated the effective frequency of aversive pictures following the uncertain cue, both during and after the task, signifying expectancy and covariation biases, and they tended to express lower subjective valences for aversive pictures presented after the uncertain cue. Pictures elicited increased P2 and LPP amplitudes when their valence could not be predicted from the cue. For the LPP, this effect was more pronounced in response to neutral pictures. Uncertainty appears to enhance the engagement of early phasic and sustained attention for uncertainly cued targets. Thus, defensive motivation related to uncertainty about future threat elicits specific attentional dynamics implicating prioritization at various processing stages, especially for nonthreatening stimuli that tend to violate expectations.",2016,Jun,Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci,16,3,447-56,26810702.0,10.3758/s13415-016-0405-8,,#2097,Dieterich 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
On the source and scope of priming effects of masked stimuli on endogenous shifts of spatial attention,"Palmer, S.; Mattler, U.","Unconscious stimuli can influence participants' motor behavior as well as more complex mental processes. Previous cue-priming experiments demonstrated that masked cues can modulate endogenous shifts of spatial attention as measured by choice reaction time tasks. Here, we applied a signal detection task with masked luminance targets to determine the source and the scope of effects of masked stimuli. Target-detection performance was modulated by prime-cue congruency, indicating that prime-cue congruency modulates signal enhancement at early levels of target processing. These effects, however, were only found when the prime was perceptually similar to the cue indicting that primes influence early target processing in an indirect way by facilitating cue processing. Together with previous research we conclude that masked stimuli can modulate perceptual and post-central levels of processing. Findings mark a new limit of the effects of unconscious stimuli which seem to have a smaller scope than conscious stimuli.",2013,Jun,Conscious Cogn,22,2,528-44,23562857.0,10.1016/j.concog.2013.03.002,,#2098,Palmer 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Masked stimuli modulate endogenous shifts of spatial attention,"Palmer, S.; Mattler, U.","Unconscious stimuli can influence participants' motor behavior but also more complex mental processes. Recent research has gradually extended the limits of effects of unconscious stimuli. One field of research where such limits have been proposed is spatial cueing, where exogenous automatic shifts of attention have been distinguished from endogenous controlled processes which govern voluntary shifts of attention. Previous evidence suggests unconscious effects on mechanisms of exogenous shifts of attention. Here, we applied a cue-priming paradigm to a spatial cueing task with arbitrary cues by centrally presenting a masked symmetrical prime before every cue stimulus. We found priming effects on response times in target discrimination tasks with the typical dynamic of cue-priming effects (Experiments 1 and 2) indicating that central symmetrical stimuli which have been associated with endogenous orienting can modulate shifts of spatial attention even when they are masked. Prime-Cue Congruency effects of perceptual dissimilar prime and cue stimuli (Experiment 3) suggest that these effects cannot be entirely reduced to perceptual repetition priming of cue processing. In addition, priming effects did not differ between participants with good and poor prime recognition performance consistent with the view that unconscious stimulus features have access to processes of endogenous shifts of attention.",2013,Jun,Conscious Cogn,22,2,486-503,23528730.0,10.1016/j.concog.2013.02.008,,#2099,Palmer 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Different Brain Circuitries Mediating Controllable and Uncontrollable Pain,"Brascher, A. K.; Becker, S.; Hoeppli, M. E.; Schweinhardt, P.","Uncontrollable, compared with controllable, painful stimulation can lead to increased pain perception and activation in pain-processing brain regions, but it is currently unknown which brain areas mediate this effect. When pain is controllable, the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) seems to inhibit pain processing, although it is unclear how this is achieved. Using fMRI in healthy volunteers, we examined brain activation during controllable and uncontrollable stimulation to answer these questions. In the controllable task, participants self-adjusted temperatures applied to their hand of pain or warm intensities to provoke a constant sensation. In the uncontrollable task, the temperature time courses of the controllable task were replayed (yoked control) and participants rated their sensation continuously. During controllable pain trials, participants significantly downregulated the temperature to keep their sensation constant. Despite receiving the identical nociceptive input, intensity ratings increased during the uncontrollable pain trials. This additional sensitization was mirrored in increased activation of pain-processing regions such as insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. Further, increased connectivity between the anterior insula and medial PFC (mPFC) in the uncontrollable and increased negative connectivity between dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and insula in the controllable task were observed. This suggests a pain-facilitating role of the mPFC during uncontrollable pain and a pain-inhibiting role of the dlPFC during controllable pain, both exerting their respective effects via the anterior insula. These results elucidate neural mechanisms of context-dependent pain modulation and their relation to subjective perception. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Pain control is of uttermost importance and stimulus controllability is an important way to achieve endogenous pain modulation. Here, we show differential effects of controllability and uncontrollability on pain perception and cerebral pain processing. When pain was controllable, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex downregulated pain-evoked activation in important pain-processing regions. In contrast, sensitization during uncontrollable pain was mediated by increased connectivity of the medial prefrontal cortex with the anterior insula and other pain-processing regions. These novel insights into cerebral pain modulation by stimulus controllability have the potential to improve treatment approaches in pain patients.",2016,May 4,J Neurosci,36,18,5013-25,27147654.0,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1954-15.2016,,#2100,Brascher 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Unpredictability impairs goal-directed target processing and performance,"Dieterich, R.; Endrass, T.; Kathmann, N.; Weinberg, A.","Unpredictability influences emotion and attention, but its effects on goal-directed behavior are unclear. We examined whether unpredictable events interfere with performance, using event-related potentials to specify underlying attentional dynamics. The paradigm involved task-irrelevant distracters of either predictable or unpredictable content (neutral/negative) preceding targets of a stimulus discrimination task. Mean and single-trial analyses showed that unpredictable compared to predictable distracters elicited larger late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes and were followed by diminished P300 amplitudes and slower responses to the target. Single-trial distracter LPP mediated the trial-wise effect of unpredictable distracters on target P300. Diminished single-trial target P300 predicted slower response times, but we did not observe mediation; distracter LPP was also unrelated to behavior. These findings suggest that unpredictability impairs target processing and performance. Diminished target processing appears to result from distracters and targets competing for limited attentional resources and behavioral output is directly related to attentional engagement with the target.",2019,Mar,Biol Psychol,142,,29-36,30668965.0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2019.01.007,,#2103,Dieterich 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Depression, not PTSD, is associated with attentional biases for emotional visual cues in early traumatized individuals with PTSD","Wittekind, C. E.; Muhtz, C.; Jelinek, L.; Moritz, S.","Using variants of the emotional Stroop task (EST), a large number of studies demonstrated attentional biases in individuals with PTSD across different types of trauma. However, the specificity and robustness of the emotional Stroop effect in PTSD have been questioned recently. In particular, the paradigm cannot disentangle underlying cognitive mechanisms. Transgenerational studies provide evidence that consequences of trauma are not limited to the traumatized people, but extend to close relatives, especially the children. To further investigate attentional biases in PTSD and to shed light on the underlying cognitive mechanism(s), a spatial-cueing paradigm with pictures of different emotional valence (neutral, anxiety, depression, trauma) was administered to individuals displaced as children during World War II (WWII) with (n = 22) and without PTSD (n = 26) as well as to non-traumatized controls (n = 22). To assess whether parental PTSD is associated with biased information processing in children, each one adult offspring was also included in the study. PTSD was not associated with attentional biases for trauma-related stimuli. There was no evidence for a transgenerational transmission of biased information processing. However, when samples were regrouped based on current depression, a reduced inhibition of return (IOR) effect emerged for depression-related cues. IOR refers to the phenomenon that with longer intervals between cue and target the validity effect is reversed: uncued locations are associated with shorter and cued locations with longer RTs. The results diverge from EST studies and demonstrate that findings on attentional biases yield equivocal results across different paradigms. Attentional biases for trauma-related material may only appear for verbal but not for visual stimuli in an elderly population with childhood trauma with PTSD. Future studies should more closely investigate whether findings from younger trauma populations also manifest in older trauma survivors.",2014,2015/01/06,Front Psychol,5,,1474,25610407.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01474,,#2106,Wittekind 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Do venepuncture procedures induce cortisol responses? A review, study, and synthesis for stress research","Weckesser, L. J.; Plessow, F.; Pilhatsch, M.; Muehlhan, M.; Kirschbaum, C.; Miller, R.","Venepuncture procedures are frequently employed to continuously monitor humoral stress markers. As such procedures are conceived as ""potent psychological and physiological stressors"", there is a need to determine whether venepuncture procedures themselves elicit cortisol responses and if so, how to deal with them appropriately. In order to assess the rate of cortisol responses to venepuncture, we conducted a literature review, which suggested that venepuncture procedures induce cortisol responses with a probability of approximately 30%. By utilizing Bayesian analysis, this result was integrated with the cortisol data of 18 healthy men who were exposed to a venepuncture procedure twice (time lag: 1 week). The currently observed response rate of 47% differed substantially from the earlier findings, which we attribute to a self-selective sampling of participants. In addition, participants showing a response to the first venepuncture were highly likely to also show a response to the second one. In this regard, we discuss the presumed conditioning of cortisol responses to venepuncture procedures. To prevent the superposition of venepuncture-induced cortisol responses and responses induced by target stressors, we propose a time- and selection-based strategy: cortisol samples taken about 110min after venepuncture should be virtually adjusted for its superimposing effects. Furthermore, previous experiences of venepuncture were highly predictive for cortisol responsiveness. This association could be utilized in further studies to identify participants who will probably show a cortisol response to venepuncture.",2014,Aug,Psychoneuroendocrinology,46,,88-99,24882161.0,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.04.012,,#2107,Weckesser 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Teachers' stress intensifies violent disciplining in Tanzanian secondary schools,"Hecker, T.; Goessmann, K.; Nkuba, M.; Hermenau, K.","Violent forms of discipline in schools continue to be widespread across the globe despite their damaging effects.

Results indicated a direct association between perceived stress and emotional violent discipline (beta=.18, p<.05) as well as physical violent discipline (beta=.37, p<.001).

Sense of presence and anxiety during virtual social interactions between a human and virtual humans,"Morina, N.; Brinkman, W. P.; Hartanto, D.; Emmelkamp, P. M.","Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) has been shown to be effective in treatment of anxiety disorders. Yet, there is lack of research on the extent to which interaction between the individual and virtual humans can be successfully implanted to increase levels of anxiety for therapeutic purposes. This proof-of-concept pilot study aimed at examining levels of the sense of presence and anxiety during exposure to virtual environments involving social interaction with virtual humans and using different virtual reality displays. A non-clinical sample of 38 participants was randomly assigned to either a head-mounted display (HMD) with motion tracker and sterescopic view condition or a one-screen projection-based virtual reality display condition. Participants in both conditions engaged in free speech dialogues with virtual humans controlled by research assistants. It was hypothesized that exposure to virtual social interactions will elicit moderate levels of sense of presence and anxiety in both groups. Further it was expected that participants in the HMD condition will report higher scores of sense of presence and anxiety than participants in the one-screen projection-based display condition. Results revealed that in both conditions virtual social interactions were associated with moderate levels of sense of presence and anxiety. Additionally, participants in the HMD condition reported significantly higher levels of presence than those in the one-screen projection-based display condition (p = .001). However, contrary to the expectations neither the average level of anxiety nor the highest level of anxiety during exposure to social virtual environments differed between the groups (p = .97 and p = .75, respectively). The findings suggest that virtual social interactions can be successfully applied in VRET to enhance sense of presence and anxiety.

Causal Interactive Links Between Presence and Fear in Virtual Reality Height Exposure,"Gromer, D.; Reinke, M.; Christner, I.; Pauli, P.","Virtual reality plays an increasingly important role in research and therapy of pathological fear. However, the mechanisms how virtual environments elicit and modify fear responses are not yet fully understood. Presence, a psychological construct referring to the 'sense of being there' in a virtual environment, is widely assumed to crucially influence the strength of the elicited fear responses, however, causality is still under debate. The present study is the first that experimentally manipulated both variables to unravel the causal link between presence and fear responses. Height-fearful participants (N = 49) were immersed into a virtual height situation and a neutral control situation (fear manipulation) with either high versus low sensory realism (presence manipulation). Ratings of presence and verbal and physiological (skin conductance, heart rate) fear responses were recorded. Results revealed an effect of the fear manipulation on presence, i.e., higher presence ratings in the height situation compared to the neutral control situation, but no effect of the presence manipulation on fear responses. However, the presence ratings during the first exposure to the high quality neutral environment were predictive of later fear responses in the height situation. Our findings support the hypothesis that experiencing emotional responses in a virtual environment leads to a stronger feeling of being there, i.e., increase presence. In contrast, the effects of presence on fear seem to be more complex: on the one hand, increased presence due to the quality of the virtual environment did not influence fear; on the other hand, presence variability that likely stemmed from differences in user characteristics did predict later fear responses. These findings underscore the importance of user characteristics in the emergence of presence.",2019,2019/01/30,Front Psychol,10,,141,30761054.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00141,,#2111,Gromer 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Top-down influence on gaze patterns in the presence of social features,"Flechsenhar, A.

In the present study we tested these predictions for socially relevant stimuli occurring in naturalistic scenes using eye tracking. We hypothesized that social features (i.e. human faces or bodies) would be processed preferentially over non-social features (i.e. objects, animals) regardless of their low-level saliency. To challenge this notion, we included three tasks that deliberately addressed non-social attributes. In agreement with our hypothesis, social information, especially heads, was preferentially attended compared to highly salient image regions across all tasks. Social information was never required to solve a task but was regarded nevertheless. More so, after completing the task requirements, viewing behavior reverted back to that of free-viewing with heavy prioritization of social features. Additionally, initial eye movements reflecting potentially automatic shifts of attention, were predominantly directed towards heads irrespective of top-down task demands. On these grounds, we suggest that social stimuli may provide exclusive access to the priority map, enabling social attention to override reflexive and controlled attentional processes. Furthermore, our results challenge the generalizability of saliency-based attention models.",2017,2017/08/24,PLOS ONE,12,8,e0183799,28837673.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0183799,,#2113,Flechsenhar 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Altered autonomic arousal in psychosis: an analysis of vulnerability and specificity,"Clamor, A.; Hartmann, M. M.; Kother, U.; Otte, C.; Moritz, S.; Lincoln, T.

At rest, skin conductance level was assessed and photoplethysmography was applied to measure time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV).

With the exception of sympathetic activity, participants with psychosis exhibited more extreme arousal than the control groups. First-degree relatives and participants with attenuated symptoms showed comparable autonomic activity to healthy controls.

In a sample of 327 Facebook users (age: M(SD) = 23.67(3.96), range: 18-56), both forms of narcissism were positively related to anxiety symptoms and FA. Moreover, the association between both forms of narcissism and FA was partly mediated by anxiety symptoms. Results enter new territory by revealing hidden similarities between vulnerable and grandiose narcissists, emphasizing that similar mechanisms might explain their enhanced risk to develop addictive tendencies of Facebook use. These findings should be considered when assessing individuals at risk for FA and when developing (therapeutic) intervention programs to deal with problematic use of social platforms.",2020,2020/11/02,PLOS ONE,15,11,e0241632,33137131.0,10.1371/journal.pone.0241632,,#2116,Brailovskaia 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"The Cycle of Violence: Associations Between Exposure to Violence, Trauma-Related Symptoms and Aggression--Findings from Congolese Refugees in Uganda","Hecker, T.; Fetz, S.; Ainamani, H.; Elbert, T.","War-related trauma exposure has been linked to aggression and enhanced levels of community and family violence, suggesting a cycle of violence. Reactive aggression--an aggressive reaction to a perceived threat--has been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In contrast, appetitive aggression--a hedonic, intrinsically motivated form of aggression--seems to be negatively related to PTSD in offender and military populations. This study examined the associations between exposure to violence, trauma-related symptoms and aggression in a civilian population. In semistructured interviews, 290 Congolese refugees were questioned about trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and aggression. War-related trauma exposure correlated positively with exposure to family and community violence in the past month (r = .31, p < .001), and appetitive (r = .18, p = .002) and reactive aggression (r = .29, p < .001). The relationship between war-related trauma exposure and reactive aggressive behavior was mediated by PTSD symptoms and appetitive aggression. In a multiple sequential regression analysis, trauma exposure (beta = .43, p < .001) and reactive aggression (beta = .36, p < .001) were positively associated with PTSD symptoms, whereas appetitive aggression was negatively associated (beta = -.13, p = .007) with PTSD symptoms. Our findings were congruent with the cycle of violence hypothesis and indicate a differential relation between distinct subtypes of aggression and PTSD.",2015,Oct,J Trauma Stress,28,5,448-55,26467328.0,10.1002/jts.22046,,#2117,Hecker 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Transgenerational trauma in a post-conflict setting: Effects on offspring PTSS/PTSD and offspring vulnerability in Cambodian families,"Burchert, S.; Stammel, N.; Knaevelsrud, C.","We assessed transgenerational effects of maternal traumatic exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder on trauma-related symptoms in Cambodian offspring born after the genocidal Khmer Rouge Regime. We conducted a randomized cross-sectional study. N=378 mothers from 4 provinces of the country and one of each of their grown-up children were interviewed. Lifetime traumatic exposure was determined using a context-adapted event list. Present posttraumatic stress symptoms and a potential posttraumatic stress disorder were assessed using the civilian version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist. We found no indication of transgenerational effects that were directly related to maternal traumatic exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms or posttraumatic stress disorder. Instead, a gender-specific moderating effect was found. Individual traumatic exposure had a stronger effect on posttraumatic stress symptoms in daughters, the higher the mother's lifetime traumatic exposure. There is evidence of an interaction between lifetime traumatic exposure of mothers and their offspring that can be interpreted as an increased vulnerability to symptoms of posttraumatic stress in daughters. The mechanisms of transgenerational trauma in the Cambodian context require further research, as learning from previous conflicts will be instructive when addressing the pressing humanitarian needs of today's world.",2017,Aug,Psychiatry Res,254,,151-157,28460286.0,10.1016/j.psychres.2017.04.033,,#2118,Burchert 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Sudden gains in two psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder,"Konig, J.; Karl, R.; Rosner, R.; Butollo, W.","We examined sudden, large, and stable shifts in symptoms from one therapy session to the next in two treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Shifts in a positive direction (sudden gains) have so far been more frequently analyzed than those in a negative direction (sudden losses). We analyzed data from 102 outpatients suffering from PTSD who received either a cognitive-behavioral or a Gestalt-based intervention. Sudden gains, at 22.5%, were more frequent than sudden losses (3.9% of patients). Participants who had experienced sudden gains had lower PTSD scores at posttreatment, but not at the 6-month follow-up. As sudden losses were so rare, they were not analyzed statistically. Sudden gains accounted for 52% of overall treatment gains or 26% of overall change in a positive direction. Among very successful patients, those with sudden gains were overrepresented, but in absolute terms, there were as many patients without sudden gains in this group. There was no connection between sudden gains and type of intervention or depressive symptoms.

Baseline Patient Characteristics Predicting Outcome and Attrition in Cognitive Therapy for Social Phobia: Results from a Large Multicentre Trial,"Hoyer, J.; Wiltink, J.; Hiller, W.; Miller, R.; Salzer, S.; Sarnowsky, S.; Stangier, U.; Strauss, B.; Willutzki, U.; Leibing, E.","We examined the role of baseline patient characteristics as predictors of outcome (end-state functioning, response and remission) and attrition for cognitive therapy (CT) in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Beyond socio-demographic and clinical variables such as symptom severity and comorbidity status, previously neglected patient characteristics (e.g., personality, self-esteem, shame, interpersonal problems and attachment style) were analysed. METHOD: Data came from the CT arm of a multicentre RCT with n = 244 patients having DSM-IV SAD. CT was conducted according to the manual by Clark and Wells. Severity of SAD was assessed at baseline and end of treatment with the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Multiple linear regression analyses and logistic regression analyses were applied. RESULTS: Up to 37% of the post-treatment variance (LSAS) could be explained by all pre-treatment variables combined. Symptom severity (baseline LSAS) was consistently negatively associated with end-state functioning and remission, but not with response. Number of comorbid diagnoses was negatively associated with end-state functioning and response, but not with remission. Self-esteem was positively associated with higher end-state functioning and more shame with better response. Attrition could not be significantly predicted. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the initial probability for treatment success mainly depends on severity of disorder and comorbid conditions while other psychological variables are of minor importance, at least on a nomothetic level. This stands in contrast with efforts to arrive at an empirical-based foundation for differential indication and argues to search for more potent moderators of therapeutic change rather on the process level. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Personality, self-esteem, shame, attachment style and interpersonal problems do not or only marginally moderate the effects of interventions in CT of social phobia. Symptom severity and comorbid diagnoses might affect treatment outcome negatively. Beyond these two factors, most patients share a similar likelihood of treatment success when treated according to the manual by Clark and Wells.

The relationship between prior night's sleep and measures of infant imitation,"Konrad, C.; Herbert, J. S.; Schneider, S.; Seehagen, S.","We examined whether sleep quality during the night and naps during the day preceding a learning event are related to memory encoding in human infants. Twenty-four 6- and twenty-four 12-month-old infants' natural sleeping behavior was monitored for 24 hr using actigraphy. After the recording period, encoding was assessed using an imitation paradigm. In an initial baseline phase, infants were allowed to interact with the stimulus to assess spontaneous production of any target actions. Infants then watched an experimenter demonstrate a sequence of three target actions and were immediately given the opportunity to reproduce the demonstrated target actions to assess memory encoding. Analyses revealed significant correlations between nighttime sleep quality variables (sleep efficiency, sleep fragmentation) and immediate imitation in 6-month-olds, but not in 12-month-olds. High sleep quality in the preceding night was thus positively associated with next day's memory encoding in 6-month-old infants.",2016,May,Dev Psychobiol,58,4,450-61,26762973.0,10.1002/dev.21387,,#2122,Konrad 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Spatial remapping in visual search: Remapping cues are provided at attended and ignored locations,"Bucher, L.; Bublak, P.; Kerkhoff, G.; Geyer, T.; Muller, H.; Finke, K.","We experience the world as stable and continuous, despite the fact that visual input is overwritten on the retina with each new ocular fixation. Spatial remapping is the process that integrates selected visual information into successive (continuous) representations of our spatial environment, thereby allowing us to keep track of objects, and experience the world as stable, despite frequent eye (re-)fixations. The present paper investigates spatial remapping in the context of visual pop-out search. Within standard instances of the pop-out paradigm, reactions to stimuli at previously attended locations are facilitated (faster and more accurate), and reactions to stimuli at previously ignored locations are inhibited (slower and less accurate). The mechanisms that support facilitation at previously attended locations, and inhibition at previously ignored locations, serve to enhance the efficiency of visual search. It is thus natural to expect that information about which locations were previously attended to or ignored is stored and remapped as a concomitant to successive representations of the spatial environment. Using variants of the pop-out paradigm, we corroborate this expectation, and show that information concerning the prior status of locations, as attended to or ignored, is remapped following attention shifts, with some degradation of information concerning ignored locations.",2018,Oct,Acta Psychol (Amst),190,,103-115,30056328.0,10.1016/j.actpsy.2018.07.004,,#2123,Bucher 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"We might be wrong, but we think that hedging doesn't protect your reputation","Collins, P. J.; Hahn, U.","We gain much of our knowledge from other people. Because people are fallible-they lie, mislead, and are mistaken-it seems essential to monitor their claims and their reliability as sources of information. An intuitive way to do this is to draw on our expectations about claims and sources: to perform expectation-based updating (Hahn, Merdes, & von Sydow, 2018). But this updating can have damaging consequences, leading us into a kind of confirmation bias. An alternative is to keep track of outcomes and record whether a claim proves true or false: to perform outcome-based updating (Hahn et al., 2018). This form of updating does not have the negative repercussions on belief accuracy. But both forms of updating might undermine the trust and cooperation assumed to be necessary for successful communication. We explore a potential boundary condition on these types of updating. We investigate whether speakers can protect their reputation when they make claims with low prior probability, with and without knowledge of the final outcome. We explore suggestions from McCready (2015) that speakers can protect themselves by hedging with evidential language: in particular with weaker propositional attitudes (""I suspect that . . ."") and so-called double hedges (""I might be wrong, but I think . . .""). We find that both forms of updating are robust to hedging with this evidential language and find no clear evidence for a protective effect. We discuss extra ingredients that may allow successful hedging.

The main outcome variable was the event-related potential P2, an indicator for social reward processing. Moreover, positive emotions were assessed. Twenty-eight patients with SAD, 29 patients with BPD and 28 healthy controls (HCs) participated. As expected, HCs and patients with BPD, but not patients with SAD, showed an increase in the P2 amplitude from the inclusion to the overinclusion condition.

The borderlands of waking: Quantifying the transition from reflective thought to hallucination in sleep onset,"Speth, C.; Speth, J.","We lose waking consciousness spontaneously and regularly over the circadian cycle. It seems that every time we fall asleep, reflective thinking gradually gives way to our interactions with an imaginary, hallucinatory world that brings multimodal experiences in the absence of adequate external stimuli. The present study investigates this transition, proposing a new measure of hallucinatory states. Reflective thinking and motor imagery were quantified in 150 mentation reports provided by 16 participants after forced awakenings from different physiology-monitored time intervals after sleep onset. Cognitive agency analysis and motor agency analysis--which are objective (grammatical-semantic) tools derived from linguistic theories--show (i) a decrease in reflective thinking which sleepers would need to acknowledge the hallucinatory quality of their state, and (ii) an increase in motor imagery, indicating interactions with a hallucinatory world.

We found that the N2pc component reflects a bias toward angry faces with excellent internal consistency. Similar results were obtained for explicit ratings. Reaction time (RT) differences, however, were not indicative of attentional biases and showed zero odd-even reliability. We further found that both higher (i.e., more negative) N2pc amplitudes and earlier peak latencies were associated with more severe symptoms of social anxiety even when controlling for general trait anxiety.

You see what you avoid: Fear of spiders and avoidance are associated with predominance of spiders in binocular rivalry,"Muller, U. W. D.; Gerdes, A. B. M.; Alpers, G. W.","What we see is the result of an efficient selection of cues in the visual stream. In addition to physical characteristics this process is also influenced by emotional salience of the cues. Previously, we showed in spider phobic patients that fear-related pictures gain preferential access to consciousness in binocular rivalry. We set out to replicate this in an independent unselected sample and examine the relationship of this perceptual bias with a range of symptom clusters. To this end, we recruited 79 participants with variable degrees of fear of spiders. To induce binocular rivalry, a picture of either a spider or a flower was projected to one eye, and a neutral geometric pattern to the other eye. Participants continuously reported what they saw. We correlated indices of perceptual dominance (first percept, dominance duration) with individual fear of spiders and with scores on specific symptom clusters of fear of spiders (i.e., vigilance, fixation, and avoidance coping). Overall, higher fear of spiders correlates with more predominace of spider pictures. In addition, this perceptual bias is uniquely associated with avoidance coping. Interestingly, this demonstrates that a perceptual bias, which is not intentionally controlled, is linked with an instrumental coping behavior, that has been implicated in the maintenance of pathological fear.",2022,Mar,J Anxiety Disord,86,,102513,34942504.0,10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102513,,#2135,Muller 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
The Whistleblower's Dilemma in Young Children: When Loyalty Trumps Other Moral Concerns,"Misch, A.; Over, H.; Carpenter, M.","When a group engages in immoral behavior, group members face the whistleblower's dilemma: the conflict between remaining loyal to the group and standing up for other moral concerns.

Children (n = 96) watched puppets representing their ingroup vs. outgroup members commit either a mild or a severe transgression. After the mild transgression, children tattled on both groups equally often. After the severe transgression, however, they were significantly less likely to blow the whistle on their ingroup than on the outgroup. These results suggest that children have a strong tendency to act on their moral concerns, but can adjust their behavior according to their group's need: When much is at stake for the ingroup (i.e., after a severe moral transgression), children's behavior is more likely to be guided by loyalty.",2018,2018/03/01,Front Psychol,9,,250,29545763.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00250,,#2136,Misch 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Indoor or Outdoor? Generalization of Costly Pain-Related Avoidance Behavior to Conceptually Related Contexts,"Kloos, T.; van Vliet, C.; Riecke, J.; Meulders, A.","When pain persists beyond healing time and becomes a ""false alarm"" of bodily threat, protective strategies, such as avoidance, are no longer adaptive. More specifically, generalization of avoidance based on conceptual knowledge may contribute to chronic pain disability. Using an operant robotic-arm avoidance paradigm, healthy participants (N = 50), could perform more effortful movements in the threat context (eg, pictures of outdoor scenes) to avoid painful stimuli, whereas no pain occured in the safe context (eg, pictures of indoor scenes). Next, we investigated avoidance generalization to conceptually related contexts (ie, novel outdoor/indoor scenes). As expected, participants avoided more when presented with novel contexts conceptually related to the threat context than in novel exemplars of the safe context. Yet, exemplars belonging to one category (outdoor/indoor scenes) were not interchangeable; there was a generalization decrement. Posthoc analyses revealed that contingency-aware participants (n = 27), but not non-aware participants (n = 23), showed the avoidance generalization effect and also generalized their differential pain-expectancy and pain-related fear more to novel background scenes conceptually related to the original threat context. In contrast, the fear-potentiated startle response was not modulated by context. PERSPECTIVE: This article provides evidence for contextual modulation of avoidance behavior and its generalization to novel exemplars of the learned categories based on conceptual relatedness. Our findings suggest that category-based generalization is a plausible mechanism explaining why patients display avoidance behavior in novel situations that were never directly associated with pain.",2022,Apr,J Pain,23,4,657-668,34793960.0,10.1016/j.jpain.2021.10.010,,#2138,Kloos 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

We investigated these questions using the speeded reasoning task with new mathematical items in a sample of 62 university students. Solution rates and reaction times indicated interference between naive and scientific mathematical theories.

Our experiment investigated the short-term effect of motivation and emotion manipulation in a group of young healthy subjects, and thus, the significance for patients in the locked-in state, who may be in need of a BCI, remains to be investigated.",2021,Aug,Psychophysiology,58,8,e13832,33945156.0,10.1111/psyp.13832,,#2141,Kleih-Dahms 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Development of a Short and ICD-11 Compatible Measure for DSM-5 Maladaptive Personality Traits Using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms,"Kerber, A.; Schultze, M.; Muller, S.; Ruhling, R.

In this study, we pursued the goal of developing a short and reliable assessment for maladaptive traits, which is compatible with both models, using the item pool of the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5). To this aim, we applied ant colony optimization algorithms in English- and German-speaking samples comprising a total N of 2,927. This procedure yielded a 34-item measure with a hierarchical latent structure including six maladaptive trait domains and 17 trait facets, the ""Personality Inventory for DSM-5, Brief Form Plus"" (PID5BF+). While latent structure, reliability, and criterion validity were ascertained in the original and in two separate validation samples (n = 849, n = 493) and the measure was able to discriminate personality disorders from other diagnoses in a clinical subsample, results suggest further modifications for capturing ICD-11 Anankastia.",2022,Apr,Assessment,29,3,467-487,33371717.0,10.1177/1073191120971848,,#2142,Kerber 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Differential Effects of Psychological Interventions in Online and Face-to-Face Settings on DSM-5 and ICD-11 Maladaptive Trait Domains: An Exploratory Pilot Study,"Kerber, A.; Schaeuffele, C.; Krieger, T.; Urech, A.; Riper, H.; Berger, T.; Boettcher, J.; Knaevelsrud, C.","While mental health treatments have proven to be effective for a range of mental health problems, there is comparably little research on its effects on personality disorders or difficulty (PD). New dimensional conceptualizations of PD such as the ICD-11 PD model enable the cost- and time-effective dimensional assessment of severity and style of PD. Furthermore, they constitute a promising tool to investigate PD, not only as a treatment endpoint but also as a predictive or influencing factor for mental health treatments. In this study, we investigated the effects in two different mental health treatment settings [online (N = 38); face-to-face and blended [FTF/blended] (N = 35)] on the reduction of maladaptive personality traits as well as the interaction between maladaptive personality patterns and the response on primary endpoints (i.e., mental distress). Results indicate that both treatment settings have comparable within-group effects on the reduction of distress symptoms, while the treatment in the FTF/blended setting seems to have a stronger impact on the reduction of maladaptive traits. Further, reduction of maladaptive trait expressions was a reliable predictor of treatment response in the FTF/blended setting while explaining less variance in the online setting.

Fear processing in dental phobia during crossmodal symptom provocation: an fMRI study,"Hilbert, K.; Evens, R.; Maslowski, N. I.; Wittchen, H. U.; Lueken, U.","While previous studies successfully identified the core neural substrates of the animal subtype of specific phobia, only few and inconsistent research is available for dental phobia. These findings might partly relate to the fact that, typically, visual stimuli were employed. The current study aimed to investigate the influence of stimulus modality on neural fear processing in dental phobia. Thirteen dental phobics (DP) and thirteen healthy controls (HC) attended a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) symptom provocation paradigm encompassing both visual and auditory stimuli. Drill sounds and matched neutral sinus tones served as auditory stimuli and dentist scenes and matched neutral videos as visual stimuli. Group comparisons showed increased activation in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and thalamus in DP compared to HC during auditory but not visual stimulation. On the contrary, no differential autonomic reactions were observed in DP. Present results are largely comparable to brain areas identified in animal phobia, but also point towards a potential downregulation of autonomic outflow by neural fear circuits in this disorder.

Relating experimentally-induced fear to pre-existing phobic fear in the human brain,"Levine, S. M.; Pfaller, M.; Reichenberger, J.; Shiban, Y.; Muhlberger, A.; Rupprecht, R.; Schwarzbach, J. V.","While prior work has demonstrated that fear-conditioning changes the neural representation of previously neutral stimuli, it remains unknown to what extent this new representation abstracts away from specific fears and which brain areas are involved therein. To investigate this question, we sought commonalities between experimentally-induced fear via electric shocks and pre-existing phobia. Using functional MRI, we tested the effect of fear-conditioning pictures of dogs in 21 spider-fearful participants across three phases: baseline, post-conditioning, and extinction. Considering phobic stimuli as a reference point for the state of fear allowed us to examine whether fear-conditioning renders information patterns of previously neutral stimuli more similar to those of phobic stimuli. We trained a classification algorithm to discriminate information patterns of neutral stimuli (rats) and phobic stimuli and then tested the algorithm on information patterns from the conditioned stimuli (dogs). Performing this cross-decoding analysis at each experimental phase revealed brain regions in which dogs were classified as rats during baseline, as spiders following conditioning, and again as rats after extinction. A follow-up analysis showed that changes in visual perception information cannot explain the changing classification performance. These results demonstrate a common neural representation for processing fear-eliciting information, either pre-existing or acquired by classical conditioning.",2018,Feb 1,Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci,13,2,164-172,29281096.0,10.1093/scan/nsx147,,#2146,Levine 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Do Mothers Benefit from a Child-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) for Childhood Functional Abdominal Pain? A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,"Calvano, C.; Gross, M.; Warschburger, P.","While the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) approaches for childhood functional abdominal pain (FAP) is well-established for child outcomes, only a few studies have reported on parent-specific outcomes.

Methods: The sample constituted of 15 mothers in the intervention group (IG) and 14 mothers in the waitlist control group (WLC). Outcome measures were assessed pre-treatment, post-treatment and at three months follow-up. Results: Analyses revealed significant, large changes in maladaptive maternal reactions related to the child's abdominal pain in the IG compared to the WLC-i.e., reduced attention (d = 0.95), medical help-seeking (d = 0.92), worries (d = 1.03), as well as a significant increase in behaviors that encourage the child's self-management (d = 1.03). In addition, maternal self-efficacy in dealing with a child's pain significantly increased in the IG as well (d = 0.92). Treatment effects emerged post-treatment and could be maintained until three months follow-up. There were no effects on general self-efficacy and maternal quality of life. Conclusion: While these results are promising, and underline the efficacy of the CBT approach for both the child and mothers, further studies, including long-term follow-ups, are warranted.",2017,Feb 15,Children (Basel),4,2,13,28212279.0,10.3390/children4020013,,#2147,Calvano 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Results from confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that alternative factor models for PTSD, including a new model derived from this population (anhedonia and affect model) resulted in a better fit than the current DSM V models. Taken together, the results showed that a good fit, as well as the measurement invariance of PTSD factors, could be obtained by applying the anhedonia and hybrid model.

A bias toward the unknown: individual and environmental factors influencing exploratory behavior,"Petzke, T. M.; Schomaker, J.","With limited resources, exploring new opportunities is crucial for survival. Exploring novel options, however, comes at the cost of uncertainty. Therefore, there is a trade-off between exploiting options with a known beneficial outcome and exploring novel options with a potentially higher gain. Computational models have suggested that novelty may promote exploratory behavior by inducing a so-called novelty bonus through reward-related processes. So far, few studies have provided behavioral evidence for such a novelty bonus. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether spatial novelty can stimulate exploratory behavior (Experiment 1), and whether age, novelty-seeking, and reduced action radius or social interactions due to COVID-19 restrictions influenced the exploration-exploitation trade-off (Experiment 2). In both experiments, we employed a novel paradigm in which participants made binary decisions between food items, while on rare trials, a surprise option was presented. Results from Experiment 1 are in line with a novelty bonus, with spatial novelty promoting exploratory behavior. In Experiment 2, we found that exploratory behavior declined with age, high novelty seekers made more exploratory choices than low novelty seekers, and participants with a smaller action radius made fewer exploratory choices. These findings are consistent with previous findings in animals and predictions from computational models.",2022,Jun,Ann N Y Acad Sci,1512,1,61-75,35218049.0,10.1111/nyas.14757,,#2151,Petzke 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Revisiting the Factor Structure of the German WISC-V for Clinical Interpretability: An Exploratory and Confirmatory Approach on the 10 Primary Subtests,"Pauls, F.; Daseking, M.","With the exception of a recently published study and the analyses provided in the test manual, structural validity is mostly uninvestigated for the German version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fifth Edition (WISC-V). Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to examine the latent structure of the 10 WISC-V primary subtests on a bifurcated extended population-representative German standardization sample (N=1,646) by conducting both exploratory (EFA; n=823) and confirmatory (CFA; n=823) factor analyses on the original data. Since no more than one salient subtest loading could be found on the Fluid Reasoning (FR) factor in EFA, results indicated a four-factor rather than a five-factor model solution when the extraction of more than two suggested factors was forced. Likewise, a bifactor model with four group factors was found to be slightly superior in CFA. Variance estimation from both EFA and CFA revealed that the general factor dominantly accounted for most of the subtest variance and construct reliability estimates further supported interpretability of the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ). In both EFA and CFA, most group factors explained rather small proportions of common subtest variance and produced low construct replicability estimates, suggesting that the WISC-V primary indexes were of lower interpretive value and should be evaluated with caution. Clinical interpretation should thus be primarily based on the FSIQ and include a comprehensive analysis of the cognitive profile derived from the WISC-V primary indexes rather than analyses of each single primary index.",2021,2021/09/14,Front Psychol,12,,710929,34594275.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.710929,,#2152,Pauls 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Does Repeated Testing Impact Concordance Between Genital and Self-Reported Sexual Arousal in Women?,"Velten, J.; Chivers, M. L.; Brotto, L.

The level of agreement between these two aspects of response is termed sexual concordance and has been increasingly investigated because of its implications for understanding models of sexual response and as a potential endpoint in clinical trials of treatments to improve women's sexual dysfunction. However, interpreting changes in sexual concordance may be problematic because, to date, it still is unclear how repeated testing itself influences sexual concordance in women. We are aware of only one study that evaluated temporal stability of concordance in women, and it found no evidence of stability. However, time stability would be necessary for arguing that concordance is a stable individual difference. The main goal of this study was to investigate the test-retest reliability of sexual concordance in a sample of 30 women with sexual difficulties. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we found that sexual concordance was not influenced by repeated testing 12 weeks later, but showed test-retest reliability suggesting temporal stability. Our findings support the hypothesis that sexual concordance is a relatively stable individual difference and that changes in sexual concordance after treatment or experimental conditions could, therefore, be attributed to effects of those conditions.",2018,Apr,Arch Sex Behav,47,3,651-660,28929390.0,10.1007/s10508-017-1076-4,,#2154,Velten 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Future Time Perspective in Occupational Teams: Do Older Workers Prefer More Familiar Teams?,"Gartner, L. U. A.; Hertel, G.","Working in teams is quite popular across different industries and cultures. While some of these teams exist for longer time periods, other teams collaborate only for short periods and members switch into new teams after goals are accomplished. However, workers' preferences for joining a new team might vary in different ways. Based on Carstensen's socioemotional selectivity theory, we predict that emotionally meaningful teams are prioritized when occupational future time perspective (OFTP) is perceived as limited. Building and expanding on studies outside of the work context, we expected that older as compared to younger workers prefer more familiar teams, and that this effect is mediated by workers' OFTP. Moreover, we assumed that experimentally manipulated OFTP can change such team preferences. The hypotheses were tested in an online scenario study using three experimental conditions (within-person design). Four hundred and fifty-four workers (57% female, age M = 45.98, SD = 11.46) were asked to choose between a familiar and a new team in three consecutive trials: under an unspecified OFTP (baseline), under an expanded OFTP (amendment of retirement age), and under a restricted OFTP (insolvency of the current company). Whereas the baseline condition was always first, the order of the second and third conditions was randomized among participants. In the baseline condition, results showed the expected mediation effect of workers' OFTP on the relation between workers' age and preference for a familiar over a new team. Higher age was associated with more limited OFTP, which in turn was associated with higher preference for a familiar over a new team. Moreover, experimentally restricting OFTP increased preference for a familiar team over a new team regardless of workers' age, providing further evidence for the assumed causal processes and showing interesting avenues for practical interventions in occupational teams.",2017,2017/09/26,Front Psychol,8,,1639,29018376.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01639,,#2156,Gartner 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Transfer Effects to a Multimodal Dual-Task after Working Memory Training and Associated Neural Correlates in Older Adults - A Pilot Study,"Heinzel, S.; Rimpel, J.; Stelzel, C.; Rapp, M. A.","Working memory (WM) performance declines with age. However, several studies have shown that WM training may lead to performance increases not only in the trained task, but also in untrained cognitive transfer tasks. It has been suggested that transfer effects occur if training task and transfer task share specific processing components that are supposedly processed in the same brain areas. In the current study, we investigated whether single-task WM training and training-related alterations in neural activity might support performance in a dual-task setting, thus assessing transfer effects to higher-order control processes in the context of dual-task coordination. A sample of older adults (age 60-72) was assigned to either a training or control group. The training group participated in 12 sessions of an adaptive n-back training. At pre and post-measurement, a multimodal dual-task was performed in all participants to assess transfer effects. This task consisted of two simultaneous delayed match to sample WM tasks using two different stimulus modalities (visual and auditory) that were performed either in isolation (single-task) or in conjunction (dual-task). A subgroup also participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the performance of the n-back task before and after training. While no transfer to single-task performance was found, dual-task costs in both the visual modality (p < 0.05) and the auditory modality (p < 0.05) decreased at post-measurement in the training but not in the control group. In the fMRI subgroup of the training participants, neural activity changes in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during one-back predicted post-training auditory dual-task costs, while neural activity changes in right DLPFC during three-back predicted visual dual-task costs. Results might indicate an improvement in central executive processing that could facilitate both WM and dual-task coordination.",2017,2017/02/24,Front Hum Neurosci,11,,85,28286477.0,10.3389/fnhum.2017.00085,,#2157,Heinzel 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Taking Care Triple P for Foster Parents With Young Children in Foster Care: Results of a 1-Year Randomized Trial,"Job, A. K.; Ehrenberg, D.; Hilpert, P.; Reindl, V.; Lohaus, A.; Konrad, K.; Heinrichs, N.","Young children with a history of maltreatment or neglect in foster families often confront their caregivers with particularly challenging behaviors. This may lead to more parenting stress, an increased risk for the child in foster care to experience further maltreatment, and placement disruptions. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a parent group training tailored to the special needs of foster families. We hypothesized significant short- and long-term improvements regarding foster parents' parenting competencies, child mental health problems, and related outcomes. Eighty-one families with 87 children in foster care aged 2 to 7 years participated in the trial. For the intervention study, 44 randomly selected families (54%) were offered to participate in the parent group training. Intervention and control group families were reassessed three times over a period of 1 year. Contrary to our expectations, we found no advantages of the intervention group compared with the usual care control group on any outcome measure. Instead, we found some significant changes in both groups across time. Placement into foster care is associated with some favorable outcomes for children in foster care. Additional support for foster families beyond the services delivered in the youth welfare system to foster parents was not associated with more favorable outcomes. The present intervention is likely associated with a low risk of harm but also with a high likelihood of a lack of significant benefits for foster parents and their young children going beyond feeling satisfied about the delivered services.

The role of violence perpetration in driving externalizing problems and offending behavior among youth from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo,"Dumke, L.; Haer, R.; Zawadka, A.; Salmen, C.; Hecker, T.","Youth in conflict-affected regions are exposed to a multitude of traumatic events. These individuals often witness violence; experience it firsthand; and, in some cases, become perpetrators. The interplay of events shapes systematic trauma histories that may have unique implications for youths' mental health. In a cross-sectional study conducted in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we interviewed 295 war-affected youth (63.4% boys, M(age) = 16.70 years), including former child soldiers (n = 171), regarding their traumatic experiences and mental health. Using latent class analysis, we identified four common trauma history classes categorized by (a) low exposure, (b) medium exposure, (c) high exposure, and (d) high exposure/perpetration. Across the sample, gradual increases in trauma load corresponded with increased vulnerability to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, eta(p) (2) = .36, and internalizing problems, eta(p) (2) = .12; however, only youth from the high exposure/perpetration class differed significantly from other youth in their levels of externalizing problems, eta(p) (2) = .13, and offending behaviors, eta(p) (2) = .17. A longer time in armed groups was related to a higher risk of both experiencing and perpetrating violence. The results indicate that it is not child soldier status, per se, but the perpetration of violence that reinforces a cycle of violence in conflict-affected societies by contributing to increased externalizing problems and offending behaviors. In conflict regions, integrated approaches are needed to address both trauma and externalizing problems of war-affected youth.",2022,Dec,J Trauma Stress,35,6,1696-1708,36047455.0,10.1002/jts.22871,,#2159,Dumke 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Gait Patterns and Mood in Everyday Life: A Comparison Between Depressed Patients and Non-depressed Controls,"Adolph, Dirk; Tschacher, Wolfgang; Niemeyer, Helen; Michalak, Johannes","Abstract Background Previous laboratory findings suggest deviant gait characteristics in depressed individuals (i.e., reduced walking speed and vertical up-and-down movements, larger lateral swaying movements, slumped posture). However, since most studies to date assessed gait in the laboratory, it is largely an open question whether this association also holds in more naturalistic, everyday life settings. Thus, within the current study we (1) aimed at replicating these results in an everyday life and (2) investigated whether gait characteristics could predict change in current mood. Methods We recruited a sample of patients (n = 35) suffering from major depressive disorder and a sample of age and gender matched non-depressed controls (n = 36). During a 2-day assessment we continuously recorded gait patterns, general movement intensity and repetitively assessed the participant’s current mood. Results We replicated previous laboratory results and found that patients as compared to non-depressed controls showed reduced walking speed and reduced vertical up-and-down movements, as well as a slumped posture during everyday life episodes of walking. Moreover, independent of clinical diagnoses, higher walking speed, and more vertical up-and-down movements significantly predicted more subsequent positive mood, while changes in mood did not predict subsequent changes in gait patterns. Conclusion In sum, our results support expectations that embodiment (i.e., the relationship between bodily expression of emotion and emotion processing itself) in depression is also observable in naturalistic settings, and that depression is bodily manifested in the way people walk.

Objective For children and adolescents in particular, we developed the screening-tools ChilD-S and DesTeen and assessed their validity as opposed to established instruments. Methods Both screeners were validated in a paediatric (228 children, 316 adolescents) and a clinical sample (77 children, 87 adolescents). Gold standard for validation were ICD-10 diagnoses of a depressive episode or dysthymia based on a structured interview. Using receiver operating characteristic analyses, the area under the curve (AUC) and the cut-offs with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity were computed. In addition, it was examined whether the instruments differed significantly in validity measures. Results Point-prevalences were 5.3% (children) and 9.8% (adolescents) in paediatric care and 23.5% and 26.1% in clinical care.The 8-item ChilD-S yielded AUCs of 98% and 93% in the paediatric and in the clinical sample.

1648 – What do adolescents know about depression? Efficacy and utility of an information booklet,"Allgaier, A.-K.; Schiller, Y.; Eberle-Sejari, R.; Schulte-Körne, G.","Adolescents still lack knowledge about depression and its treatment. As a result, depressed adolescents are confronted with stigmata that are barriers to treatment-seeking. Studies in adults demonstrated that depression literacy can be increased by educational material. We developed an information booklet on depression specifically addressing adolescents aged 13 to 17. For the first time, it was examined whether knowledge about depression in youth can be enhanced by reading an educational leaflet. The information booklet was evaluated in 628 German ninth graders (M= 15.1 years, 58% boys) in a pre-postfollow- up design.Using study-specific questionnaires, knowledge about seven topics on depression was assessed. Key subjects were symptoms and treatment of depression as well as suicidality.In addition, students evaluated the booklet's layout, content and utility.

"Social Comparison, Envy, and Depression on Facebook: A Study Looking at the Effects of High Comparison Standards on Depressed Individuals","Appel, Helmut; Crusius, Jan; Gerlach, Alexander L.","The co-occurrence of depression and envy is both plausible and empirically established. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this correlation. An account is proposed according to which low self-esteem in depressed individuals leads to upward social comparison and thus makes envy more likely. This effect should frequently occur in online social networks like Facebook because they allow for easy impression management and hence provide high comparison standards. In a quasi-experimental online study, depressed and nondepressed participants indicated their self-esteem and were then presented with specifically set up Facebook profiles that were either attractive or unattractive. Participants were asked to compare themselves to the profile owner and to report their resulting feelings of inferiority and envy. Depressed participants were more envious, especially after seeing the attractive profile. Envy was associated with higher self-reported inferiority and also correlated negatively with self-esteem. The connection between depression and envy is demonstrated with an experimental elicitation of envy for the first time. The results strongly suggest that low self-esteem and consequent feelings of inferiority play a crucial role in depressed individuals' elevated levels of envy. Practical implications and limitations are discussed.",2015,,Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology,34,4,277-289,,10.1521/jscp.2015.34.4.277,,#2164,Appel 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Ethnic Variation in Emotion Regulation,"Arens, Elisabeth A.; Balkir, Nazli; Barnow, Sven","Emotion regulation (ER) via cognitive reappraisal has been shown to be superior to the use of expressive suppression regarding several aspects of mental well-being. However, a cultural perspective suggests that the consequences of emotional suppression may be moderated by cultural values. In order to examine whether this also applies to clinical samples, we investigated healthy and depressed German women and healthy and depressed Turkish immigrants living in Germany. Groups were compared in terms of frequency of ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) and with which different aspects of mental well-being the same are associated. Healthy Turkish immigrants exhibited a greater ER balance (frequent use of suppression plus frequent use of reappraisal), which was associated with more positive outcomes of expressive suppression in Turkish than in German women. None of these differences were found in patient samples, both of which showed a greater use of emotional suppression than cognitive reappraisal. Results suggest that the cultural moderation of the link between emotional suppression and well-being is associated with a greater ER balance in healthy Turkish individuals. Depressed Turkish patients may not profit from suppression due to their more rigid use of it.",2012,,Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology,44,3,335-351,,10.1177/0022022112453314,,#2165,Arens 2012,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Are Acute Increases and Variability in Emotion Regulation Strategies Related to Negative Affect and Paranoid Thoughts in Daily Life?,"Bahlinger, Katrin; Lincoln, Tania M.; Clamor, Annika","Abstract Background Negative affect reliably predicts paranoid thoughts. Previous studies point to the importance of emotion regulation for paranoid thoughts but have not yet focused on effects of acute increases and variability in strategy use. Methods We conducted an experience-sampling study for one week in a subclinical sample. Acute increases in the intensity of strategy use from one measurement point until the next, between-strategy variability (i.e., standard deviation between all strategies at one measurement point), and within-strategy variability (i.e., standard deviation of each strategy over one day) were analyzed for effects on negative affect and paranoid thoughts. Results Multi-level-models indicated that acute increases in acceptance and reappraisal are associated with less negative affect. Acute increases in acceptance, but not in reappraisal, were related to less paranoid thoughts. In contrast, acute increases in rumination and suppression were associated with more negative affect and paranoid thoughts. Between- and within-strategy variability were no significant predictors. Conclusions Acute increases in the intensity of but not variability in emotion regulation strategies are related to negative affect and paranoid thoughts in daily life. Future studies are needed to examine whether improving emotion regulation leads to sustainable reductions in symptoms.",2021,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,46,1,62-72,,10.1007/s10608-021-10253-1,,#2169,Bahlinger 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Validation of the Readiness for End-of-Life Conversations (REOLC) scale in a German hospital setting,"Berlin, Pia; Seifart, Carola; von Blanckenburg, Pia","For every health behavior, readiness to engage is a necessary and crucial foundation for following conversations, interventions or behavior changes. The present study aims to support a one-factor structure for the Readiness for End-of-Life Conversations (REOLC) scale (Berlin et al., 2021) in a population of cancer patients (N = 295). For validation purposes, data of patients participating in a screening development study at a university clinic was used. Model adequacy was analyzed with structural equation modelling and controlled for with goodness of fit indices: χ2-test, SRMR, rRMSEA. Discriminant and convergent validity were assessed with correlations of REOLC and psychological or health behavior measures. Factor structure was supported with good fit indices, discriminant validity and convergent validity. Readiness correlated significantly with age and reported death anxiety. The REOLC scale is a reliable instrument to assess cancer patients' readiness for end-of-life conversations. Future studies may further address moderating and mediating effects of socio-demographic, medical and psychological factors. The assessment of readiness may further indicate anxiety levels of cancer patients and enables practitioners to provide interventions accordingly. However, in a clinical setting and especially for patients with a palliative prognosis, end-of-life care conversations may need to be introduced early.",2022,,PEC Innovation,1,,100045,,10.1016/j.pecinn.2022.100045,,#2179,Berlin 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Early cortical processing of vection-inducing visual stimulation as measured by event-related brain potentials (ERP),"Berti, Stefan; Haycock, Bruce; Adler, Julia; Keshavarz, Behrang","Abstract Visual motion stimuli can induce the perception of self-motion in stationary observers (known as vection). In the present study, we investigated the sensory processing underlying vection by measuring the human event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by the movement onset of a visual stimulus. We presented participants a visual stimulus consisting of alternating black-and-white vertical bars that moved in horizontal direction, creating the sensation of vection. The stimulus was presented on a screen that was divided into a central and a surrounding peripheral visual area. Both areas moved independently from each other, resulting in four different movement patterns: the peripheral and the central stimulus moved in the same or opposite direction, or one of the two visual areas of the stimulus moved while the other remained stable. In addition, two different stimulus types varying with respect to the bars’ width (narrow vs. wide) were used. Participants were presented with these stimuli in two phases of the experiment: During EEG-recording, only short phases (2.5–3.5 ms) of visual motion were applied. In a separate rating phase, visual motion was presented for 45 s. In this phase, vection onset, intensity, and duration were verbally recorded. Overall, the visual stimulation generated vection with different intensities (i.e., weakest vection with sole central stimulus movement). Stimulus type did not affect vection. In the ERPs, stimulus onset elicited parieto-occipital P2 and N2 components. The amplitudes of the ERP components differed significantly between the four movement patterns (irrespective of stimulus type), however, they did not fully align with the subjective vection ratings. Since the ERPs are associated with early sensory processing preceding vection, we argue that the ERPs mirror the contribution of sensory cortical processes to vection rather than the subjective sensation of vection per se.",2019,,Displays,58,,56-65,,10.1016/j.displa.2018.10.002,,#2180,Berti 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Neural correlates of emotional action control in anger-prone women with borderline personality disorder,"Bertsch, Katja; Roelofs, Karin; Roch, Paul Jonathan; Ma, Bo; Hensel, Saskia; Herpertz, Sabine C.; Volman, Inge","Difficulty in controlling emotional impulses is a crucial component of borderline personality disorder (BPD) that often leads to destructive, impulsive behaviours against others. In line with recent findings in aggressive individuals, deficits in prefrontal amygdala coupling during emotional action control may account for these symptoms.To study the neurobiological correlates of altered emotional action control in individuals with BPD, we asked medication-free, anger-prone, female patients with BPD and age- and intelligence-matched healthy women to take part in an approach-avoidance task while lying in an MRI scanner. The task required controlling fast behavioural tendencies to approach happy and avoid angry faces. Additionally, before the task we collected saliva testosterone and self-reported information on tendencies to act out anger and correlated this with behavioural and functional MRI (fMRI) data.We included 30 patients and 28 controls in our analysis. Patients with BPD reported increased tendencies to act out anger and were faster in approaching than avoiding angry faces than with healthy women, suggesting deficits in emotional action control in women with BPD. On a neural level, controlling fast emotional action tendencies was associated with enhanced activation in the antero- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex across groups. Healthy women showed a negative coupling between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right amygdala, whereas this was absent in patients with BPD.Specificity of results to BPD and sex differences remain unknown owing to the lack of clinical control groups and male participants.The results indicate reduced lateral prefrontal-amygdala communication during emotional action control in anger-prone women with BPD.

The relationship between self-traumatized and self-vulnerable automatic associations and posttraumatic stress symptoms among adults who have experienced a distressing life event,"Blackwell, Simon E.; Ehring, Thomas; Gladwin, Thomas E.; Margraf, Jürgen; Woud, Marcella L.","Abstract Convergent evidence supports a crucial role for dysfunctional appraisals in the development and maintenance of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, most research in this area has used self-report measures, assessing only explicit forms of such negative cognitions; the relevance of their more automatically-activated counterparts, as assumed by cognitive models, remains relatively unexplored. The current study aimed to further our understanding of the potential utility of measuring automatic dysfunctional associations in the context of posttraumatic stress. The relationship between scores on two different implicit association tests (IATs) and posttraumatic stress symptoms was investigated in a sample of adults ( N = 279) who reported having experienced a potentially traumatic negative life event. Participants completed the two IATs (one assessing self-traumatized associations, the other self-vulnerable associations), a self-report measure of dysfunctional appraisals, and measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms and other aspects of psychopathology online. Scores indicating higher levels of dysfunctional associations on both IATs were associated with higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Only scores on the IAT measuring self-vulnerable associations, and not the IAT measuring self-traumatized associations, continued to show an association with posttraumatic stress symptoms after controlling for explicit dysfunctional appraisals. Overall, the results indicate the value of investigating PTSD-relevant automatic associations to further develop our understanding of cognitive processes implicated in posttraumatic stress.",2021,,Current Psychology,,,,,10.1007/s12144-021-02441-9,,#2182,Blackwell 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

However, many empirical results show that attachments to different attachment figures differ substantially. In this study, 512 emerging adults rated their attachment quality to one parent, the romantic partner, and several friends over three measurement occasions. We used a multilevel structural equation model to examine the degree of consistency and different aspects of specificity. Attachment to parents was strongly associated with the attachment to friends (around r = .4) and less strongly with the attachment to romantic partners (around r = .3). However, most of the variance was specific to the different attachment figures. Attachments to different friends were more strongly correlated with each other than with the attachments to figures of other domains.

Brain Painting V2: evaluation of P300-based brain-computer interface for creative expression by an end-user following the user-centered design,"Botrel, L.; Holz, E.M.; Kübler, A.","Brain Painting is a brain-computer interface (BCI) application that allows for painting on a virtual canvas without requiring motor input. Following the user-centered design, we developed Brain Painting V2 (BP2) for two end-users with ALS (‘HP’ and ‘JT’) who use Brain Painting independently at home (BP1). After including line drawing and multiple shapes in BP2, we report the evaluation of 27 home use days by JT over 3.5 months. On scales from 0 to 10, the end-user indicated good satisfaction M = 7.1 (SD = 1.7), good enjoyment M = 6.9 (SD = 1.9) and low frustration M = 2.3 (SD = 2.5). Workload as measured once with the NASA Task Load Index was substantial (65/100). Satisfaction as assessed once with the QUEST2.0 was high (4.8/5) and maximum (5/5) for the BCI-specific aspects. Level of control predicted satisfaction, indicating the importance of maintaining high BCI accuracy. As results are based on one end-user only, they cannot be generalized to the population of potential BP2 end-users. However, the high satisfaction and the constant independent home use of BP2 by end-user JT illustrates that we provided JT with a BCI-controlled application which matches his needs and demonstrates the benefit of adopting user-centered design in BCI development.",2015,,Brain-Computer Interfaces,2,2-3,135-149,,10.1080/2326263x.2015.1100038,,#2186,Botrel 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

Furthermore, we investigated, whether there is a comparable relationship between narcissism and Facebook use in these countries. To this end, the data of 72 Russian platform members were collected and compared with the data of 122 German members. The narcissism values did not significantly differ between the two samples. This was also the case with the overall self-presentation and interaction. In contrast, some single measures of online behaviour differ. For example, German users set more Likes and had more online-friends than Russian users. Russian platform members used more applications than German users.

Work Overload and Addictive Social Media Use: A Relationship with Depression Symptoms and Life Satisfaction,"Brailovskaia, Julia; Frahsek, Marc; Margraf, Jürgen","Abstract Work overload is highly related to mental health issues. Online social media are often used to escape the feelings of overload. In the current study, 291 employees from various job sectors completed an online survey related to work overload, addictive social media use (SMU), and mental health (i.e., depression symptoms, life satisfaction). Work overload was significantly positively associated with addictive SMU ( r = 0.209, p &lt; 0.001) and depression symptoms ( r = 0.190, p &lt; 0.001). The relationship between work overload and life satisfaction was significantly negative ( r = −0.175, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, addictive SMU significantly mediated the association between work overload and depression symptoms (total effect: p = 0.002, direct effect: p = 0.052), and the association between work overload and life satisfaction (total effect: p = 0.006, direct effect: p = 0.064). The present result reveals that high work overload could foster addictive SMU that could impact employees’ mental health. Therefore, the attention of employees and employers should be attracted to the potential negative consequences of intensive SMU.

A two-week gaming abstinence reduces Internet Gaming Disorder and improves mental health: An experimental longitudinal intervention study,"Brailovskaia, Julia; Meier-Faust, Julius; Schillack, Holger; Margraf, Jürgen","Since the COVID-19 outbreak, digital gaming has become a welcome pastime and distraction for many people. However, this phenomenon can have severe consequences; intensive digital gaming can foster the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and negatively affect mental health. The present experimental longitudinal study investigated the consequences of a conscious abstinence from gaming in a German sample. The experimental group ( N = 131; age: M = 26.21, SD = 7.70) did not engage in gaming for two weeks; the control group ( N = 140; age: M = 25.10, SD = 4.94) maintained its gaming time and habits. Gaming-related variables and mental health-related variables were assessed via online surveys at five measurement time points (baseline, intermediate status, post-intervention, one-month follow-up, three-month follow-up). The intervention significantly reduced gaming time, gaming flow, IGD, daily stress, and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, we found a significant improvement in positive mental health. The effects were stable over the three months of the investigation. Thus, we could show that a conscious and controlled, short-term abstinence from gaming leads to reduced IGD and a better mental health. The present results emphasize that conscious periods of gaming abstinence could be an effective step in the clinical context and in mental health prevention programs, especially during a pandemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak. • Two-week gaming-abstinence reduces gaming time and gaming flow longitudinally. • Two-week gaming-abstinence reduces the level of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). • Two-week gaming-abstinence reduces the experience of daily stress and anxiety symptoms. • Two-week gaming-abstinence increases positive mental health. • Temporary gaming-abstinence can protect mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.",2022,,Computers in Human Behavior,134,,107334,,10.1016/j.chb.2022.107334,,#2193,Brailovskaia 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
"How to prevent side effects of social media use (SMU)? Relationship between daily stress, online social support, physical activity and addictive tendencies – A longitudinal approach before and during the first Covid-19 lockdown in Germany","Brailovskaia, Julia; Ozimek, Phillip; Bierhoff, Hans-Werner","• Daily stress positively predicts addictive social media use (SMU) three months later during Covid-19 lockdown. • Online social support mediates the link between daily stress and addictive SMU. • Physical activity moderates the link between online social support and addictive SMU. • Physical activity before Covid-19 outbreak can contribute to less addictive SMU during the pandemic. People who experience high levels of daily stress often resort to intensive social media use (SMU). In the short-term, this can contribute to relief and positive emotions. However, in the longer-term, intensive online activity can foster addictive tendencies. The present longitudinal study investigated the association between daily stress and addictive SMU.

In moderated mediation analyses, the positive relationship between daily stress (BL) and addictive SMU (BL) and (FU) was significantly mediated by the level of perceived online social support (BL). Physical activity (BL) (e.g., jogging and cycling) significantly moderated the relationship between online social support (BL) and addictive SMU (BL) and (FU). Specifically, the association between both variables was significant for medium and low frequency of physical activity, but not for high frequency.

Twelve-month suicidal ideation was reported by 10.2% of the medical students and by 11.5% of the other students. Medical students had significantly lower levels of depression symptoms and significantly higher levels of PMH than students from other disciplines. Complete mental health – according to the dual-factor model of mental health – was reported by more than 84% of the total sample. Data were assessed by a self-report survey that is prone to social desirability. Students in the present study displayed high rates of complete mental health – although the survey was conducted in the midst of the Corona pandemic. No evidence was found that medical students are particularly stressed.",2022,,Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,9,,100354,,10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100354,,#2198,Brailovskaia 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Physical activity mediates the association between daily stress and Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD) – A longitudinal approach among German students,"Brailovskaia, Julia; Teismann, Tobias; Margraf, Jürgen","Abstract Physical activity has regularly been demonstrated to be a protective factor against stressful experiences. The present study investigated whether physical activity buffers the association between daily stress and Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD) over a period of one year (first measurement time point, T1: October 2016; second measurement time point, T2: October 2017). In a sample of 122 German Facebook users (82.8% women; age at T1: M = 21.70, SD = 3.67, range: 17–38), physical activity at T1 mediated the significant positive relationship between chronic daily stress at T1 and FAD at T2 (total effect: p = .036; direct effect: p = .164). Furthermore, at T2, FAD was significantly negatively associated with positive mental health (i.e., high level of emotional, social, and psychological well-being). The current study provides first longitudinal results of possible risk associated with and potential protective factors of FAD. These results demonstrated that this addictive behavior is positively related to chronic daily stress and negatively related to physical activity.

The present longitudinal study investigated physical activity (for example jogging, cycling) and positive mental health (PMH) as potential factors that can reduce the risk of suicide ideation and suicidal behavior. Data of 223 participants (79.4% women; M age (SD age ) = 22.85 (4.05)) were assessed at two measurement time points over a three-year period (2016: first measurement = baseline (BL); 2019: second measurement = follow-up (FU)) via online surveys. The results reveal a significant positive relationship between higher physical activity (BL) and higher PMH (BL). Higher scores of both variables were significantly negatively linked to lower suicide-related outcomes (FU). Moreover, the association between higher physical activity (BL) and lower suicide-related outcomes (FU) was significantly mediated by higher PMH (BL). The current findings demonstrate that physical activity in combination with PMH can reduce the risk of suicide-related outcomes.

"The patterns of problematic social media use (SMU) and their relationship with online flow, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in Lithuania and in Germany","Brailovskaia, Julia; Truskauskaite-Kuneviciene, Inga; Kazlauskas, Evaldas; Margraf, Jürgen","Abstract The present study investigated problematic social media use (SMU) in Lithuania and in Germany. In two student samples (Lithuania: N = 1640; Germany: N = 727), problematic SMU, flow experienced during SMU, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were assessed by online surveys. Latent Class Analysis resulted in a four-group classification of participants due to their levels of problematic SMU characteristics: low-symptom , low-withdrawal , high-withdrawal , and high-symptom . The proportion of participants in the low-symptom group was significantly higher in Germany than in Lithuania. In contrast, significantly more Lithuanian participants belonged to both withdrawal groups. No significant country differences were found for the composition of the high-symptom group. In both countries, a series of Structural Equation Models showed that the level of flow, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms was the highest in the high-symptom group, and the lowest in the low-symptom group. Life satisfaction revealed the reversed result pattern. The current findings show that students from Lithuania and Germany can be grouped considering their problematic SMU level. Individuals in the four groups differ due to their level of mental health. Especially members of the high-symptom group might benefit from external controlling strategies of their time spent on SM, while members of the withdrawal groups are suggested to train their SMU self-control.",2021,,Current Psychology,42,5,3713-3724,,10.1007/s12144-021-01711-w,,#2201,Brailovskaia 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
The Differential Relationship Between Self-Reported Interoceptive Accuracy           and Attention With Psychopathology,"Brand, Sebastian; Petzke, Tara M.; Witthöft, Michael","Abstract. Background: Only recently has interoception been discussed as a common risk factor for psychopathology. Recent approaches distinguish between the ability to accurately perceive ( interoceptive accuracy) and the propensity to attend ( interoceptive attention) to internal signals. Objective: To examine the latent structure of self-reported interoceptive accuracy and attention and their relationships to psychopathology. Methods: We used a confirmatory factor analysis to clarify the latent structure of interoceptive accuracy and attention. Structural equation modeling was utilized to determine relationships between both abilities with internalizing and somatoform symptomatology according to the HiTOP model ( Kotov et al., 2017 ). Data from N = 619 persons from the German general population were analyzed. Results: Interoceptive attention showed significant positive relationships with all psychopathological traits ( r = .221 to r = .377), whereas interoceptive accuracy was negatively associated with internalizing symptomatology ( r = -.106). Conclusion: The present findings indicate that personal beliefs about interoceptive abilities have different influences on psychopathological developments.",2022,,Zeitschrift für Klinische Psychologie und Psychotherapie,51,3-4,165-175,,10.1026/1616-3443/a000678,,#2205,Brand 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Ambivalence over emotional expression in major depression,"Brockmeyer, Timo; Grosse Holtforth, Martin; Krieger, Tobias; Altenstein, David; Doerig, Nadja; Friederich, Hans-Christoph; Bents, Hinrich","High ambivalence over the expression of emotions (AEE) has consistently been associated with high levels of depression in previous research. However, there is a lack of studies examining this construct and its associations in a clinical sample of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Eight items of the ruminative response scale are sufficient to measure weekly within-person variation in rumination,"Brose, Annette; Raedt, Rudi De; Vanderhasselt, Marie-Anne","Abstract The Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) is commonly used to measure people’s general tendency to ruminate. In this study, we explored whether only few items from the RRS can be used to capture within-person variation in rumination in intensive longitudinal studies. Such a short RRS version would allow, for example, monitoring the development of rumination during clinical interventions. We measured rumination on five occasions, with at least one week in between. We used multilevel analyses to analyze the data at the within- and between-person level. Using only eight RRS items, we successfully modeled a reflective self-regulation and depressive brooding factor, similar to the two subfacets of rumination as distinguished by Treynor et al. (2003). We also established convergent validity of depressive brooding at the within- and between-person level of analysis and convergent validity of reflection at the between-person level. We thus introduced a short form of the RRS that captures within-person variation in depressive brooding and reflection well. The short RRS is readily applicable in studies on within-person variation or change in rumination.",2020,,Current Psychology,41,7,4210-4218,,10.1007/s12144-020-00913-y,,#2212,Brose 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Differences in the Between–Person and Within–Person Structures of Affect Are A Matter of Degree,"Brose, Annette; Voelkle, Manuel C.; Lövdén, Martin; Lindenberger, Ulman; Schmiedek, Florian","This study tested whether the structure of affect observed on the basis of between–person (BP) differences is equivalent to the affect structures that organize the variability of affective states within persons (WP) over time. Further aims were to identify individual differences in the degree of divergence between the WP and BP structure and examine its association to dispositional and contextual variables (neuroticism, extraversion, well–being and stress). In 100 daily sessions, 101 younger adults rated their mood on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Variability of five negative affect items across time was so low that they were excluded from the analyses. We thus worked with a modified negative affect subscale. WP affect structures diverged reliably from the BP structure, with individual differences in the degree of divergence. Differences in the WP structural characteristics and the degree of divergence could be predicted by well–being and stress. We conclude that BP and WP structures of affect are not equivalent and that BP and WP variation should be considered as distinct phenomena. It would be wrong, for example, to conceive of positive and negative affect as independent at the WP level, as suggested by BP findings. Yet, individual differences in WP structural characteristics are related to stable BP differences, and the degree to which individuals’ affect structures diverge from the BP structure can provide important insights into intraindividual functioning.

Prevention of ADHD related problems: a universal preschool program,"Christiansen, Hanna; Hirsch, Oliver; König, Anika; Steinmayr, Ricarda; Roehrle, Bernd","Purpose – Early onset of behavioral disorders is predictive of long term adverse outcomes. There are some indicated and selective early prevention programs for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common behavioral disorders in childhood and adolescence. The purpose of this paper is to present a universal preschool program for preventing the development of ADHD related symptoms for children aged three to six. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 413 preschool children (experimental group (EG)=193; control group (CG)=220), and their teachers participated in the study. Children in the EG were randomized to two conditions: universal intervention (behavior modification (BM)=99) vs additional ADHD specific elements (BM+attention training; BM+AT=94) to evaluate effects of a universal intervention vs additional ADHD specific elements. The universal intervention trained general behavior modification (BM) techniques to enhance start behavior (i.e. following color based rules, positive participation in activities, enhancement of skills related to attentional function), and to extinguish stop behavior (i.e. hyperactive behavior such as uncontrolled running around, disturbing others, quarreling, etc.). These techniques were based on published intervention programs (Phelan and Schonour, 2004). The AT consisted of thirteen teacher led 45 minute based sessions in a small group format with an introductory play activity, 15 minutes picture based AT tasks (task analysis, action planning, action, reappraisal), a social interaction game, and a game to enhance perception of visual, auditory, olfactory, haptic, and gustatory senses. To determine effects, the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Behavior Rating for Preschoolers (VBV) were used. A high risk group with high scores on those measures was analyzed separately. Findings – Children in all three groups did not differ significantly at baseline in all relevant variables (ADHD symptoms measured with the SDQ and VBV, socio-economic status (SES), gender, age: MANCOVA: F 10,796 =1.732, p =0.07) and none of the children had a diagnosis of ADHD. After training participation, children in the EG showed significantly less ADHD related problem behavior compared to children in the CG ( F 8,1,506 =2.717, p =0.006); this was especially so for the high risk group ( F 4,754 =2.60, p =0.035). Multi-level analyses revealed significant influences of age, gender, and SES on post-training symptom ratings (SDQ: t -statistic=3.03, p =0.003; VBV 3-6: t -statistic=4.151, p &lt; 0.001). Research limitations/implications – This is a quasi-experimental study, since due to time restriction half the preschools did not want to participate in the experimental study. Thus, participating children were not randomly assigned to the experimental and control conditions, though children were randomly assigned to two different treatments within the intervention group (EG1/EG2). Due to the design of the study and to ensure high participation rates, only preschool teachers rated children’s behavior, though the predictive value of teacher ADHD symptoms exceeds parental ones. Finally, inclusion of parent training elements would most probably enhance effects. Practical implications – General BM techniques are easily taught and seem to positively influence children’s ADHD related symptoms while not harming children without such symptoms. Since studies showed that after a bogus instruction teacher expected children to exhibit ADHD symptoms and rated them as more disturbed (Rosenthal effect), a universal approach is less stigmatizing and possibly more effective, especially when interventions start early in life before symptoms result in full diagnoses. Social implications – This study established positive universal effects, and moderate to large effects for the subgroup of high risk children with ADHD related symptoms. General behavior management in preschools might thus be a possible strategy for preventive interventions of ADHD related symptoms. Originality/value – The is one of the first studies on a preventive ADHD preschool program. General BM techniques of this study were easily taught and implemented, and showed positive effects. Since selective and indicated interventions depend on high program fidelity, are harder to implement, and related to higher costs, general BM techniques as introduced in this study, might be an option for universal prevention strategies for ADHD related symptoms in preschool settings.",2015,,Health Education,115,3/4,285-300,,10.1108/he-03-2014-0040,,#2224,Christiansen 2015,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Paranoid Delusions as an Adaptive Response to Social Evaluative Stress?,"Clamor, Annika; Krkovic, Katarina","Abstract. Learning mechanisms may serve as a framework for understanding the formation of paranoia. Specifically, if paranoid thoughts after social stressors produce a short-term benefit for coping (e.g., downregulating arousal), the encountered negative reinforcement could lead to their excessive application and subsequently to long-term maladaptive convictions. The Trier Social Stress Test was utilized in healthy participants to examine this putative benefit. Participants rated paranoia at baseline and after the stressor. Subjective stress levels, negative affect, heart rate, and heart rate variability were assessed in the following rest phase (N = 59). Semipartial correlations showed that participants who responded with larger increases in paranoia were characterized by a lower heart rate in the subsequent rest phase. No associations were found with heart rate variability or psychological measures. Thus, paranoid thinking in healthy individuals could be an adaptive means for reestablishing some aspects of physiological homeostasis after a social stressor but further research is needed.",2018,,Zeitschrift für Psychologie,226,3,191-196,,10.1027/2151-2604/a000332,,#2225,Clamor 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Subsequently, they were randomly assigned to either mindfulness training or progressive muscle relaxation and received manuals accompanied by audio files. All participants were approached for reassessment six weeks later. Results No changes on any of the scales could be found in either the experimental or control group at post-assessment, even though all participants exercising mindfulness found the manual to be useful. Limitations Due to the mode of application, the study leaves open the possibility that mindfulness training is beneficial for OCD patients when delivered as a therapist guided intervention.

Attentional biases of vigilance and maintenance in obsessive-compulsive disorder: An eye-tracking study,"Cludius, Barbara; Wenzlaff, Frederike; Briken, Peer; Wittekind, Charlotte E.","Attentional biases play an important role in the development and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous studies using reaction time tasks in OCD have produced inconsistent results. This is the first study to measure attentional biases in patients with several subtypes of OCD using eye tracking. Twenty-eight patients with OCD and 21 healthy controls were assessed using a free-viewing paradigm, incorporating contamination-related, checking-related, and neutral stimuli. Attentional patterns were measured using an eye tracker. A possible vigilance bias was assessed using entry time, and a possible maintenance bias was assessed using dwell time. Patients with checking-related symptoms of OCD showed a maintenance bias but no vigilance bias in regard to checking-related compared to neutral stimuli. No differences in attention were found in patients with contamination-related symptoms. Internal validity is restricted due to a high overlap between subgroups, the lack of negative (not OCD-related) control stimuli, and the absence of a clinical control group. Patients with checking-related symptoms of OCD showed a maintenance bias to checking-related stimuli. Due to methodological limitations, the results should be considered preliminary and need to be replicated before firm conclusions can be drawn.",2019,,Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders,20,,30-38,,10.1016/j.jocrd.2017.12.007,,#2227,Cludius 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Reflective functioning in an adolescent community sample,"Cropp, Carola; Alexandrowicz, Rainer W.; Taubner, Svenja","Abstract The Reflective Functioning Scale (RFS) is a widely used psychodynamic measure that has been thoroughly studied in adult samples. However, to date empirical data regarding reflective functioning (RF) in adolescence has been sparse. The present study examines RF in a German sample of 96 adolescent pupils (aged 15–18). The study assesses the RF capacities of the adolescent pupils and examines its association to intelligence, language skills, sociodemographic data, and psychological adaptation. As expected theoretically, the mean RF score of the adolescent sample was significantly lower than that of adult community samples. Furthermore, sex, migration background and language skills were significantly related to RF. High RF capacities were associated with lower levels of externalizing symptoms especially in adolescents with psychopathy, however RF was unrelated to internalizing symptoms. The results of the study give further evidence for the importance of examining RF in adolescent individuals. The possible importance of RF as a protective factor in dealing with adversities should be considered in psychotherapy and prevention programs.",2019,,Mental Health &amp; Prevention,14,,200156,,10.1016/j.mph.2019.200156,,#2228,Cropp 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Methods We investigated explicit, decision-based, and more implicit, reaction time-based interpretation bias in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD; N = 29), social anxiety disorder (SAD; N = 36), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; N = 22), and non-clinical controls (NC; N = 32), using an adapted Word Sentence Association Paradigm (WSAP). Results Results indicated that interpretation bias occurred transdiagnostically, while content-specific bias patterns varied meaningfully across groups. BDD and SAD shared explicit and, more inconsistently, implicit interpretation biases for appearance-related and social situations. The GAD group exhibited an explicit and implicit negative interpretation bias for general situations, and an additional implicit lack of positive bias. Mechanistic Wiener diffusion model analyses revealed that interpretation bias patterns were mainly driven by speeded information uptake, potentially mirroring disorder-specific associative memory organization.

Methods: Psychology students took part in two courses on the development of diagnostic competencies ( N = 59) and on intervention skills ( N = 51). We applied active and experience-based learning strategies, including exercises on self-awareness, mindfulness, peer role-play, and the use of SPs. Competence gain as well as a general evaluation of the seminars were assessed by self-report. Results: For both seminars, self-reported competence increased significantly with a large effect.

"Relations between perceived teacher’s autonomy support, cognitive appraisals and boredom in physics learning among lower secondary school students","Ekatushabe, Margaret; Kwarikunda, Diana; Muwonge, Charles M.; Ssenyonga, Joseph; Schiefele, Ulrich","Abstract Background Boredom during learning activities has the potential of impeding attention, motivation, learning and eventually achievement. Yet, research focusing on its possible antecedents seems to have received less attention especially within the physics domain. Based on assumptions of the Control Value Theory of Achievement Emotions (CVTAE), this study aimed at examining gender differences and structural relationships between students’ reported perceived teacher autonomy support (PTAS), cognitive appraisals (self-efficacy and task value) and learning-related boredom in physics. A sample of 375 (56% females) randomly selected 9 th grade students (mean age = 15.03 years; SD = 1.02) from five secondary schools in Masaka district of Uganda took part in the study. Results Data collected from students’ self-reports using standardised instruments revealed that higher levels of PTAS, self-efficacy, and task value were significantly associated with lower levels of boredom during physics learning. Females reported significantly greater task value for learning physics than the males. Self-efficacy (β = − .10, p &lt; .05) and task value (β = − .09, p &lt; .01) partially mediated the relationship between PTAS and boredom. PTAS showed significant direct negative contributions to boredom (β = − .34, p &lt; .001). Conclusion These findings provide support for theory and practice about the importance of promoting autonomy among students by adjusting instructional behaviours among teachers of physics. Teacher autonomy supportive behaviours influence formation of students’ beliefs about ability, subjective value and learning-related boredom in physics.

"The Relationship Between Cognitive Activation, Self-Efficacy, Achievement Emotions and (Meta)cognitive Learning Strategies Among Ugandan Biology Learners","Ekatushabe, Margaret; Nsanganwimana, Florien; Muwonge, Charles M.; Ssenyonga, Joseph","According to the control-value theory of achievement emotions, the influence of cognitive activation teaching strategies on students’ effective use of Cognitive and Meta-Cognitive (CMC) learning strategies is mediated by control appraisals (e.g. self-efficacy) and achievement emotions (i.e. enjoyment and boredom). However, there is limited and contrasting empirical evidence to support this assertion despite claims of cross-cultural and domain consistency. The present study was aimed at examining the multiple mediational roles of self-efficacy and achievement emotions on the relationship between perceived cognitive activation during instruction and four CMC learning strategies among Ugandan biology students. Data were collected using anonymous questionnaires from 587 (50.6% females) tenth grade students with a mean age of 17 years (SD = 1.16) from 10 secondary schools in Uganda. We tested the mediation hypothesis in separate models with each CMC learning strategy. Indirect effects from cognitive activation through self-efficacy and/or enjoyment to CMC learning strategies were all significant confirming their mediational roles. There were significant (p < 0.001) direct effects from cognitive activation to: self-efficacy (β = 0.41), enjoyment (β = 0.26) and cognitive learning strategies, i.e. rehearsal (β = 0.30), organisation (β = 0.30) and elaboration (β = 0.33). Self-efficacy and enjoyment fully mediated the relationship between cognitive activation and metacognition. Except for self-efficacy, direct effects to or from boredom were not significant. Clearly, instructional strategies in biology that stimulate thought among learners are relevant for increasing effective use of any one of CMC learning strategies.",2021,,"African Journal of Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education",25,3,247-258,,10.1080/18117295.2021.2018867,,#2237,Ekatushabe 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

This study investigated whether a positive leadership climate prevents emotional exhaustion and buffers the negative impact of work effort in police officers. Data from a cross-sectional health survey in a German police department ( N = 570) were used to test the assumptions. Results of the hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that high work effort was correlated with high levels of emotional exhaustion and positive leadership climate was associated with low levels of emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, both predictor variables interacted, indicating a buffer effect of a positive leadership climate under stressful working conditions. This is the first study to show both direct and indirect protective effects of a positive leadership climate in police officers. In police work, stressful working conditions such as high work effort are hard to avoid. Thus, it is crucial to promote preventive factors such as a positive leadership climate to protect police officers’ health. Suggestions of how police supervisors and departments might establish a positive leadership climate are presented.",2018,,International Journal of Police Science &amp; Management,20,3,217-224,,10.1177/1461355718786295,,#2239,Engel 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Social anxiety in adolescents and young adults from the general population: an epidemiological characterization of fear and avoidance in different social situations,"Ernst, Julia; Ollmann, Theresa Magdalena; König, Elisa; Pieper, Lars; Voss, Catharina; Hoyer, Jana; Rückert, Frank; Knappe, Susanne; Beesdo-Baum, Katja","Abstract Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and, more generally, social fears are common in young people. Although avoidance behaviors are known to be an important maintaining factor of social anxiety, little is known about the severity and occurrence of avoidance behaviors in young people from the general population, hampering approaches for early identification and intervention. Symptoms, syndromes, and diagnoses of DSM-5 mental disorders including SAD were assessed in a random population-based sample of 14-21-year-olds (n = 1,180) from Dresden, Germany, in 2015/2016 using a standardized diagnostic interview (DIA-X-5/D-CIDI). An adapted version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale was used to ascertain the extent of social fears and avoidance. Diagnostic criteria for lifetime SAD were met by n = 82 participants, resulting in a weighted lifetime prevalence of 6.6%. Social anxiety was predominantly reported for test situations and when speaking or performing in front of others. Avoidance was most prevalent in the latter situations. On average, anxiety and avoidance first occurred at ages 11 and 12, respectively, with avoidance occurring in most cases either at about the same age as anxiety or slightly later. In the total sample, lifetime prevalence for most DSM-5 disorders increased with the severity of social anxiety and avoidance. Results underline the need for preventive or early intervention efforts especially regarding test anxiety and fear and avoidance of speaking in front of others. These situations are particularly relevant in youth. Avoidance behaviors may also be discussed as diagnostic marker for early case identification.",2022,,Current Psychology,,,,,10.1007/s12144-022-03755-y,,#2241,Ernst 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Event-related potentials in an associative word pair learning paradigm,"Farshad, Maryam; Pavlov, Yuri G.; Kotchoubey, Boris","The study investigated the effect of unintentional learning of semantically unrelated word pairs on event-related brain potentials. Two experiments were conducted, in whose acquisition phase participants listened to five pairs of semantically unrelated words, each pair being repeated twenty times. In the test phase of Experiment 1, these “old” pairs were presented mixed with “new” pairs containing other words. In the test phase of Experiment 2, a third condition was added in which the first word in a pair was one of the words presented during acquisition but the second word was new. In both experiments, the second word in new word pairs elicited an N400 and a late (550–1000 ms) frontal positivity. The amplitude of the N400 to new second words in Experiment 2 was significantly larger when the first word in the pair was an old (previously learnt) word, as compared with the condition in which both first and second words were new. The results indicate that, in addition to a repetition effect, unintentional learning of word pairs results in building new associations between previously unrelated words.",2021,,Journal of Neurolinguistics,59,,101001,,10.1016/j.jneuroling.2021.101001,,#2242,Farshad 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Ambient Light Conveying Reliability Improves Drivers’ Takeover Performance without Increasing Mental Workload,"Figalová, Nikol; Chuang, Lewis L.; Pichen, Jürgen; Baumann, Martin; Pollatos, Olga","Drivers of L3 automated vehicles (AVs) are not required to continuously monitor the AV system. However, they must be prepared to take over when requested. Therefore, it is necessary to design an in-vehicle environment that allows drivers to adapt their levels of preparedness to the likelihood of control transition. This study evaluates ambient in-vehicle lighting that continuously communicates the current level of AV reliability, specifically on how it could influence drivers’ take-over performance and mental workload (MW). We conducted an experiment in a driving simulator with 42 participants who experienced 10 take-over requests (TORs). The experimental group experienced a four-stage ambient light display that communicated the current level of AV reliability, which was not provided to the control group. The experimental group demonstrated better take-over performance, based on lower vehicle jerks. Notably, perceived MW did not differ between the groups, and the EEG indices of MW (frontal theta power, parietal alpha power, Task–Load Index) did not differ between the groups. These findings suggest that communicating the current level of reliability using ambient light might help drivers be better prepared for TORs and perform better without increasing their MW.",2022,,Multimodal Technologies and Interaction,6,9,73,,10.3390/mti6090073,,#2243,Figalová 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Enhancing motivation for exposure to disgust - A feasibility study with a non-clinical sample,"Fink-Lamotte, Jakob; Lüders, Juliane; Exner, Cornelia","Abstract The most effective therapy for patients with a contamination-related sub-type of obsessive-compulsive disorder is exposure with response prevention. However, several studies show that a notable proportion of patients do not benefit from exposure. One possible reason is the high functionality of compulsive thoughts and actions in shortly reducing aversive thoughts and feelings, which might cause high ambivalence and low willingness towards exposure. The present study investigates whether ambivalence and willingness can be influenced by additional motivational strategies to more effectively reduce disgust during exposure. Therefore, 54 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to either a standard exposure condition or an exposure condition whereby self-reference and action competences were amplified. The results show that disgust habituated strongly and willingness as well as persuasiveness were significant predictors of exposure success. However, the motivational intervention had no impact on disgust reduction. In light of the few experimental studies and the general difficulty of operationalizing motivational processes, four concrete implications of the study for future research are discussed.",2020,,Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders,25,,100524,,10.1016/j.jocrd.2020.100524,,#2245,Fink-Lamotte 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
"Mechanisms and Effectiveness of Imagery Strategies in Reducing Disgust in Contamination-Related Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder: Comparing Imagery Rescripting, Imagery Self-compassion and Mood-Focused Imagery","Fink-Lamotte, Jakob; Platter, Pauline; Stierle, Christian; Exner, Cornelia","Abstract Background Strong feelings of disgust and anxiety are maintaining factors in contamination-related obsessive–compulsive disorder (C-OCD). To this day there are not many studies that investigated strategies for changing pathological disgust. In a previous study, it was shown that imagery rescripting could successfully change disgust. However, whether imagery rescripting or more general imagery processing, helps to reduce pathological disgust, remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate how successful imagery rescripting is in comparison to imagery self-compassion and a passive positive imagery condition in reducing disgust. Methods For this, the three strategies were compared to each other on 2 days (within-subject) in a laboratory experiment. The study included 24 subjects with diagnosed C-OCD, and 24 matched, healthy controls (between-subject). Results The results show that all three strategies changed disgust, they do not differ from each other and that different traits appear to influence the strategies’ success or failure. The theoretically derived underlying mechanisms of the strategies were found in an elaborate content analysis. Conclusions The present study provides first indications that imagery in general can help to change pathological disgust experience.",2021,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,46,4,747-763,,10.1007/s10608-021-10275-9,,#2246,Fink-Lamotte 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Self-Resemblance Modulates Processing of Socio-Emotional Pictures in a Context-Sensitive Manner,"Finke, Johannes B.; Zhang, Xinwei; Best, Daniel R.; Lass-Hennemann, Johanna; Schächinger, Hartmut","Abstract. Relevance of emotional information varies with self-involvement. The current study was undertaken to test whether subtle facial self-resemblance is sufficient to affect attentional and affective processing of complex socio-emotional pictures. Faces digitally manipulated to resemble the participants’ (final sample: N = 21) own versus unfamiliar control faces (form and color morphs) were presented in pictures of emotionally evocative social interactions, that is, threat versus sex scenes. At stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of either 300 ms or 3,000 ms after picture onset, startle responses were elicited by acoustic white noise bursts (50 ms, 105 dB), and recorded at the orbicularis oculi via electromyography (EMG). The majority of participants remained unaware of the morphing manipulation, and awareness did not affect the principal results. As indexed by inhibition of startle at short lead intervals and by picture-evoked heart rate deceleration, facial self-resemblance modulates effects of motivational salience in a context-sensitive way, increasing prepulse inhibition with threat-related, but not erotic cues. Overall, the present study suggests that visual cues of general motivational significance and of self-relevance are integrated in a fast, presumably automatic manner.",2019,,Journal of Psychophysiology,33,2,127-138,,10.1027/0269-8803/a000216,,#2247,Finke 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Cognitive behavior therapy for driving fear: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Fischer, Carolin; Heider, Jens; Taylor, Joanne E.; Schröder, Annette","Fear of driving is common in clinical practice, while its treatment programs are understudied. This is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate a newly developed protocol for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for driving fear compared with a wait list and to use specific assessment scales. 34 participants (30 women, 4 men) in an outpatient psychotherapy clinic were randomly allocated to either 18 sessions of CBT or a wait list (n = 17 each). After treatment, CBT was significantly more efficacious than the wait list with large effect sizes on the Instrument for Fear of Driving (IFD) (Cohen’s d = 2.58) and on the Driving Cognitions Questionnaire (DCQ) (Cohen’s d = 2.14).

Measuring Driving Fear,"Fischer, Carolin; Schröder, Annette; Taylor, Joanne E.; Heider, Jens","Abstract. Presently, there is no instrument to support the diagnosis of driving fear and its severity. To enable a reliable and valid diagnosis, the 5-item German-language Instrument for Fear of Driving (IFD) was developed. The items, by DSM-5 criteria for a specific phobia, measure the emotional, cognitive, and physiological components of driving fear as well as the degree of avoidance and impairment. The present paper comprises two studies that describe the development of the IFD and its psychometric properties. In Study 1, the IFD was administered to 810 non-clinical participants in an online survey and demonstrated good reliability and construct validity. In Study 2, fifty-four people with a clinical diagnosis, including clinically relevant driving fear, completed the IFD and a clinical interview. The IFD demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity, and a cut-off score resulted in 95% sensitivity and 97% specificity. While the findings are preliminary and further studies with larger samples are needed, the IFD is a promising screening instrument for driving fear and its severity.",2023,,European Journal of Psychological Assessment,39,1,49-60,,10.1027/1015-5759/a000683,,#2249,Fischer 2023,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

INTEGRATIVE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY FOR PEOPLE WITH MILD ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE: RESULTS OF AN RCT,"Forstmeier, S.; Maercker, A.; Savaskan, E.; Roth, T.","About 90% of all mild Alzheimer dementia (AD) cases experience neuropsychiatric symptoms. Although some research has supported the effectiveness of specific psychotherapeutic approaches for mild AD, there are only few attempts to evaluate a multi-component treatment programme. This randomized controlled trial evaluates the effect of an integrative psychotherapy approach on the health of patients with mild AD and their caregivers. It consists of 25 weekly sessions, including eight modules: goal setting; psychoeducation; engagement in pleasant activities; cognitive restructuring; live review; behavior management; interventions for the caregiver; and couples counselling. 50 participants and their caregivers have been randomized to either the CBT-based intervention group (CBT) or to the control group, which received treatment-as-usual (TAU). Before and after the treatment phase, participants have been assessed. Follow-ups took place at 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The primary outcome was depression in the patient with AD. The secondary outcome measures were apathy, other neuropsychiatric symptoms, functional abilities, quality of life, and quality of the relationship to the caregiver. CBT reduced depression significantly more than TAU (interaction: F = 5.3, p < .05), with a moderate-to-large effect size (d = 0.76). There were also a significant advantage for CBT with regard to apathy (F = 4.7, p <.05; d = 0.71) and quality of the relationship to the caregiver (F = 4.3, p <.05; d = 0.77).

Quality of Life Assessment in schizophrenia - development of a short version of the QLiS,"Franz, M.; Senin, T.; Meyer, T.","The QLiS (Quality of Life in Schizophrenia) is a disease-specific questionnaire with high content validity and sound psychometric properties. It comprises 54 items related to 12 subscales. However, its use in surveys or clinical studies is limited due to its length. Our aim was to develop and validate a short form of the QLiS. Four steps were taken to develop the short form (QLiS-SF) using samples from the Clinical Analysis of the Treatment of Schizophrenia study. 1. A model with second order scales was developed using exploratory factor analysis. 2. The resulting model was tested in an independent sample using confirmative factor analysis (CFA). 3. Based on this model, items were selected on grounds of distributional properties, content reviews, and item loadings. 4. The resulting short form was validated independently through CFA. Results Three second order scales were constructed: illness-related quality of life, social life, and global subjective well-being. CFA of the new theoretical model resulted in a CFI of 0.67 and absolute fit indices of CMIN/df = 2.55, RMSEA = 0.08, SRMR = 0.09. We selected 13 items that showed good statistical properties and good fit of content to subscale. Fit of the underlying theoretical model with the 13 items was satisfactory (CFI = 0.95, CMIN/df = 2.23, RMSEA = 0.06, SRMR = 0.04). Composite reliability scores for the three subscales were above 0.70. The QLiS-SF showed adequate model fit and reliability.

Deceptive and non-deceptive placebos to reduce sadness: A five-armed experimental study,"Friehs, Thilo; Rief, Winfried; Glombiewski, Julia A.; Haas, Julia; Kube, Tobias","• Objective: Examining the effects of deceptive and non-deceptive placebos in sadness. • N=147 participants underwent a 2 × 2 + 1 design (factors: placebo, rationale style; CG). • Deceptive but not open-label placebos reduced sadness. • Personalized and scientific rationale styles evoked deceptive placebo effects. Placebo effects play an important role in psychopharmacological treatment of depression. Among the most potent mechanisms are positive treatment expectations. However, there is large heterogeneity in how they are induced. We studied the protective effects against sadness of deceptive (DP) and open-label placebos (OLP) combined with one of two new rationale styles. Healthy participants (N = 147) were randomly assigned to one of five groups. In this ”2x2+1” design, two factors were varied: The rationale style (personal-emotional style vs. scientific-matter-of-fact style) and the type of placebo (DP vs. OLP). The placebo was introduced as a protection from sadness. In addition, there was a no-treatment control group (CG). Participants viewed a sad movie scene after placebo application. The primary outcome was pre-post change in sadness, a major component of depression. Participants in the DP groups showed a significant protective effect against sadness, whereas sadness increased in both the OLP groups and the CG. There were no differences between the rationale styles. Short-term induced sadness has limited external validity in a heterogeneous long-term mental disorder like depression. In line with other OLP studies, no OLP effect could be observed in this healthy sample. In contrast, DP significantly reduced sadness. While placebo effects contribute substantially to antidepressant treatment, the potential of OLP in the treatment of depression appears to be limited in non-clinical samples. In addition, our results suggest that different ways to induce treatment expectations are possible.",2022,,Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,9,,100349,,10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100349,,#2259,Friehs 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Investigation of early night sleep effects on subsequent fear extinction learning and recall,"Friesen, Edith; Sopp, M. Roxanne; Brueckner, Alexandra H.; Ferreira de Sá, Diana; Michael, Tanja","Extinction learning is considered an important underlying process of successful treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, sleep disturbances may impede this learning process: Current accounts postulate that sleep facilitates encoding by promoting neural plasticity during slow wave sleep (SWS). Based on this hypothesis, we tested whether early night sleep, with high amounts of SWS, facilitates subsequent extinction learning and recall. Sixty-three participants took part in a trauma-adapted fear conditioning experiment. One group received a three-hour sleep opportunity in the early night half, whereas the other group stayed awake. Thereafter, both groups underwent extinction training and a return-of-fear test. Retention was assessed after another sleep opportunity in both groups. Linear mixed-effects models and Bayesian inference did not support the hypothesis of strengthened fear extinction by prior early night sleep. Subsequent exploratory analyses, in contrast, point to a role of rapid eye movement sleep in promoting successful fear extinction learning.

This study investigated to what extent psychology students currently accept and use AI and what affects their perception and usage. Therefore, an AI acceptance model based on established technology acceptance models was developed and tested in a sample of 218 psychology students. An acceptable fit with the data was found for an adapted version. Perceived usefulness and ease of use were most predictive for the students’ attitude towards AI; attitude itself, as well as perceived usefulness, social norm, and perceived knowledge, were predictors for the intention to use AI. In summary, we identified relevant factors for designing AI training approaches in psychology curricula.

Visual angle modulates affective responses to audiovisual stimuli,"Gall, Dominik; Latoschik, Marc Erich","What we see influences our emotions. Technology often mediates the visual content we perceive. Visual angle is an essential parameter of how we see such content. It operationalizes visible properties of human–computer interfaces. However, we know little about the content-independent effect of visual angle on emotional responses to audiovisual stimuli. We show that visual angle alone affects emotional responses to audiovisual features, independent of object perception. We conducted a 2 × 2 × 3 factorial repeated-measures experiment with 143 undergraduate students. We simultaneously presented monochrome rectangles with pure tones and assessed valence, arousal, and dominance. In the high visual angle condition, arousal increased, valence and dominance decreased, and lightness modulated arousal. In the low visual angle condition, pitch modulated arousal, and lightness affected valence. Visual angle weights the affective relevance of perception modalities independent of spatial representations. Visual angle serves as an early-stage perceptual feature for organizing emotional responses.

You See What you Fear: Spiders Gain Preferential Access to Conscious Perception in Spider-Phobic Patients,"Gerdes, Antje B. M.; Alpers, Georg W.","In phobic individuals, behavioral responses to phobia-related cues are facilitated and brain responses are augmented. It has rarely been investigated whether this preferential processing is accompanied by an altered conscious perception of phobia-related cues. We used binocular rivalry to investigate conscious perception of phobia-related cues in phobic individuals. 21 spider-phobic patients and 20 non-anxious control participants viewed pictures of spiders or flowers, each paired with a neutral pattern under conditions of binocular rivalry. Spider-phobic patients more often reported that they saw spider pictures as the first percept, and the total duration of seeing spider percepts was significantly longer in patients than in non-anxious participants. A second experiment was conducted to rule out that these differences were caused by different response criteria. Results support the validity of self-report in Experiment 1. In sum, predominance of phobia-related cues in binocular rivalry provides evidence that phobia-related cues gain preferential access to visual awareness in phobic individuals.",2013,,Journal of Experimental Psychopathology,5,1,14-28,,10.5127/jep.033212,,#2265,Gerdes 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Thirty-seven outpatients with OCD according to DSM-IV criteria were randomly allocated to individual, weekly 14-sessions of therapy with either MCT or ERP. Analyses focused on treatment efficacy at post-treatment and 3-months follow-up, treatment fidelity and credibility. Participants showed a significant reduction in OCD symptoms in both treatment conditions and with no differences between MCT and ERP.

Neural and endocrine stress reactions in healthy women with and without severe early life trauma,"Golde, Sabrina; Wingenfeld, Katja; Otte, Christian","Maladaptive responses to negative affective stimuli are pervasive, including clinically ill and healthy people, and men and women respond differently at neural and hormonal levels. Inspired by the Research Domain Criteria initiative, we used a transdiagnostic approach to investigate the impact of sex and dysphoric mood on neural-hormonal responses to negative affective stimuli.Participants included 99 individuals with major depressive disorder, psychosis and healthy controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was complemented with real-time acquisition of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and -gonadal (HPG) hormones. fMRI data were analyzed in SPM8 and task-related connectivity was assessed using generalized psychophysiological interaction.Across all participants, elevated cortisol response predicted lower brain activity in orbitofrontal cortex and hypothalamus-amygdala connectivity. In those with worse dysphoric mood, elevated cortisol response predicted lower activity in hypothalamus and hippocampus. In women, elevated cortisol response was associated with lower activity in medial prefrontal cortex and low hypothalamo-hippocampal connectivity. In women with high dysphoric mood, elevated cortisol response was associated with low hypothalamo–hippocampal connectivity. There were no interactions with diagnosis or medication.There was limited power to correct for multiple comparisons across total number of ROIs and connectivity targets; cortisol responses were relatively low.We conclude that the pathophysiology in neural-hormonal responses to negative affective stimuli is shared across healthy and clinical populations and varies as a function of sex and dysphoric mood.

In one subgroup, the game app sent push notifications (GN+); in the other subgroup, no notifications (GN−) were sent. In the control group (C), participants did not play a game. After the reading, participants took a multiple-choice quiz. We compared quiz scores and reading times of the groups (G) and (C) and within the gaming group (GN+, GN−) and observed no differences. Since the statistical non-significance of these tests does not entail the absence of an effect, we conducted equivalence tests, which did not demonstrate equivalence either. The experiment ensured high internal validity, yet remained inconclusive. Reasons for the similarity of performance in all groups could be non-specific exercise effects (all participants owned a smartphone), low similarity between the tasks, low variance of participants’ ability and motivation (high achieving, low ADHD scores) or low game complexity.

Receiving push-notifications from smartphone games reduces students learning performance in a brief lecture: An experimental study,"Graben, Katharina; Doering, Bettina K.; Barke, Antonia","Many university students use mobile phones during study tasks for unrelated activities. It is known that using social networking while studying reduces the learning performance. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether using smartphone games during a lecture reduces the learning performance, and whether this is influenced by receiving push notifications. Ninety-three students were randomized to three conditions: In two gaming conditions (G), participants played a custom-made gaming-app (20 s) at 2-min intervals while watching a video mimicking a lecture. In one subgroup (GN+), the game app sent push notifications; in the other (GN-), no notifications were sent. Participants in the control group (C) watched the lecture without playing. Subsequently, participants answered multiple choice questions and estimated their own quiz performance. Comparing the quiz scores and subjective performance estimates of the three groups showed that the learning performance in GN+ was lower than in C ( d = 0.51); no other differences were observed. Participants’ subjective performance estimations remained unaffected by the experimental condition.

This study aimed to determine whether individuals with BIID experience mental images and, if so, whether they differ to those experienced by individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and healthy controls. A semi-structured interview on mental images and their qualities was delivered to a sample of 22 individuals with BIID and 19 with BDD, and 22 healthy controls. Both the BIID ( n = 15, 68.2%) and BDD ( n = 14, 73.7%) groups reported significantly more mental images than healthy controls ( n = 3, 13.6%), but no differences between the two clinical groups were found. While mental images in BDD were focused on ‘flawed’ body parts, images in BIID involved the desired handicap. Mental images in BIID were experienced as less distressing and more sexually arousing compared to BDD. No further differences were found between the groups (e.g., regarding sensory multimodality, dominance of a specific body part). Although the two groups reported a similar frequency of mental images, images appear to serve different functions across conditions. Clinically, it may be necessary to target the positive mental images in BIID to improve treatment outcome.",2018,,Behaviour Change,35,3,174-184,,10.1017/bec.2018.17,,#2272,Grocholewski 2018,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
‘I can succeed at this’: engagement in service learning in schools enhances university students’ self-efficacy,"Gutzweiler, Raphael; Pfeiffer, Simone; In-Albon, Tina","Engaging in service learning has been linked to multiple positive outcomes in students, such as an increase in self-efficacy. Effects have been found on both general and domain-specific self-efficacy. Research on service learning has indicated that feedback and gender had an impact on the increase in self-efficacy, though findings are mixed. The present study aimed to determine how service learning experiences at a university can be optimally designed to boost college students’ self-efficacy, while examining the effects of feedback and gender on general and teaching self-efficacy. Over 2 years, 267 bachelor’s students in psychology (Mage = 23.08 years, SD = 3.61; 80.5% female) conducted modularized prevention programs in the context of mental health at primary and secondary schools. Students rated their general and teaching self-efficacy before (T1), during (T2), and after (T3) conducting the program. The results indicate a positive effect of engaging in service learning on students’ general (d = 0.30) and teaching (d = 0.68) self-efficacy from T1 to T3 with significant increases only in female students, and after receiving feedback. Engaging in service learning reduced gender-specific differences in self-efficacy. Feedback increased general and teaching self-efficacy.

Contamination-fear in subclinical obsessive-compulsive disorder: A further proof for no preferential processing of disorder-related stimuli,"Haberkamp, Anke; Schmidt, Filipp; Hansmeier, Jana; Glombiewski, Julia Anna","Abstract How do individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) process and respond to images of rotten food or dirty toilets? In contrast to other fear-related disorders, evidence for attentional biases and preferential processing of disorder-related stimuli in samples of OCD is mixed. To address methodological problems of previous studies and to increase validity, we used two independent samples of participants with contamination fear and two sets of standardized stimuli in an established experimental paradigm. In two experiments, we compared evaluation and visual processing of contamination-fear related (CFr) stimulus material in individuals with high (HCF) and low (LCF) contamination fear. In experiment 1, we selected CFr stimuli from a database with disgust-related images (DIRTI). Even though the HCF group rated CFr images as being more unpleasant, arousing, and disgusting, we found no indicators of preferential processing (larger priming effects or faster responses). In experiment 2, we selected CFr stimuli from a database with images specifically chosen to evoke symptom-related anxiety in OCD patients (BOCD-PS). Again, negative evaluations of stimuli did not transfer into enhanced information processing. We conclude that early information processing of CFr stimuli is fundamentally different to that of fear-related stimuli in anxiety disorders; probably because of the triggered disgust response.",2019,,Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders,21,,26-36,,10.1016/j.jocrd.2018.11.004,,#2279,Haberkamp 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
P58. Sleep in humans stabilizes hippocampal pattern separation performance,"Hanert, A.; Weber, F.D.; Pedersen, A.; Born, J.; Bartsch, T.","Sleep supports the formation of long-term memories in an active system consolidation process. Episodic memories encoded during wakefulness are temporarily stored in the hippocampus before they are transferred to the neocortex for the long term storage. During NonREM sleep, especially slow wave sleep, a reactivation of hippocampal neural representations is thought to promote this transfer, via synchronization of distinct oscillatory activity in hippocampus and neocortex. However, how this reprocessing of memory during sleep affects the memory representation in the hippocampus itself, is unclear. For this purpose, we tested hippocampal stimulus processing, i.e., pattern separation, before and after periods of sleep and wakefulness in humans. Pattern separation refers to the capability of the hippocampus to form non-overlapping orthogonal neural representations from similar episodic stimulus inputs. We found that pattern separation performance deteriorated across the wake period but remained stable across sleep (p = 0.013). Stimuli with highest similarity showed a reversed pattern with reduced pattern separation after sleep (p  With those features of NonREM sleep, serving as markers of sleep-dependent memory consolidation and hippocampal reactivation, our findings provide first-time evidence in humans supporting the notion that reactivation-based consolidation processes during sleep affect the hippocampal representation itself.",2018,,Clinical Neurophysiology,129,8,e91,,10.1016/j.clinph.2018.04.695,,#2280,Hanert 2018,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
A test of the metacognitive model of obsessive-compulsive disorder,"Hansmeier, J.; Exner, C.; Rief, W.; Glombiewski, J.A.","Abstract The question of the relative importance of dysfunctional cognitive beliefs and metacognitions in the development and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms is still a matter of debate. This study aims to investigate the relevance of OC-specific metacognitions, such as thought fusion beliefs, beliefs about rituals and stop signals for OC symptoms. Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) ( n  = 71), anxiety disorders ( n  = 51), and depressive disorders ( n  = 81), and a nonclinical sample ( n  = 300), were assessed for (meta)cognitive beliefs and OC symptoms. Analyses of variances indicated that the OCD group reported significantly more positive beliefs about rituals and stop signals than did the other three groups, also when controlling for comorbidity of depression disorder. No differences were found with regard to thought fusion beliefs. In regression analyses in the OCD sample, OC-specific metacognitions such as thought fusion beliefs explained incremental variance in OC symptoms, when controlling for cognitive beliefs and general, non OC-specific metacognitions. Overall, these findings provide further evidence for the relevance of specific metacognitions to OCD. Metacognitive therapy might address these metacognitive beliefs and thereby lead to a reduction of OC symptoms in OCD patients.",2016,,Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders,10,,42-48,,10.1016/j.jocrd.2016.05.002,,#2282,Hansmeier 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Exploring the Potential Distinction Between Continuous Traumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Stress in an East African Refugee Sample,"Hecker, Tobias; Ainamani, Herbert E.; Hermenau, Katharin; Haefele, Eva; Elbert, Thomas","Posttraumatic stress (PTS) indicates a continuous stress response that persists though threats to life had been experienced in the past. However, threats to life are frequently ongoing. For these contexts, the concept of continuous traumatic stress (CTS) has been put forward. Based on structured clinical interviews with Congolese refugees ( N = 226), this study investigated the CTS concept and whether it can be distinguished from PTS. We found that current exposure to violence correlated positively with concerns about its recurrence in the CTS group ( r = .46). An ANCOVA indicated that higher intrusion symptom severity in the PTS group (no symptom reduction under safe conditions) was explained by higher lifetime trauma exposure (η 2 = .125). In contexts of continuous trauma exposure, symptom-like responses may be regarded as appropriate responses to realistic danger. In these contexts, the possibility that symptom changes are a response to real threats should be considered to avoid overestimation of PTSD prevalences.",2017,,Clinical Psychological Science,5,6,964-973,,10.1177/2167702617717023,,#2284,Hecker 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Drugs Boosting Conflict?

Due to its characteristics, narcotics are considered to be one of the most influential resources. However, the dynamics of how this particular commodity is linked to conflict is still not well understood.

Prospective mental imagery, i.e. future-directed voluntary imagery-based thought, about potentially-rewarding activities may offer a mechanistically-informed intervention that targets deficits in reward processing, a core clinical feature of depression. We propose that the previously described impact of prospective mental imagery on motivation for everyday activities is facilitated by affective forecasting , i.e. predictions about an individual’s emotional response to the imagined activities. Methods Participants ( N = 120) self-nominated six activities to engage in over the following week and were randomized to either: (1) an affective forecasting imagery condition ( n = 40); (2) a neutral process imagery condition ( n = 40); or (3) a no-imagery control condition ( n = 40). Results As predicted, increases in motivation ratings from pre to post experimental manipulation were significantly higher following affective forecasting imagery compared to both neutral process imagery ( d = 0.62) and no-imagery ( d = 0.91). Contrary to predictions, the number of activities participants engaged in did not differ between conditions. Conclusions Results provide initial evidence for a potentially important role of affective forecasting in prospective mental imagery.

Self- and observer ratings of capacity limitations in patients with neurological conditions,"Henning, Anne; Linden, Michael; Muschalla, Beate","Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the self- and observer ratings of capacity limitations in patients with neurological conditions. Research on this topic is relevant for assessing the patients’ ability to participate in work and social life and improving collaborative patient-clinician relationships. Method: The self- and observer ratings of capacity limitations in a sample of N = 245 patients with neurological conditions from a rehabilitation facility were compared and assessed using the short rating of activity limitations and participation restrictions in mental disorders according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (Mini-ICF-APP) and the equivalent self-rating questionnaire (Mini-ICF-APP-S). Results: Paired-samples t -tests revealed significant differences between the self- and observer ratings for six out of 13 capacity dimensions. On average, the patients rated the capacity dimensions adherence to regulations , planning and structuring of tasks , professional competency and endurance as significantly less limited, in comparison to the observers (small to medium effect sizes). The self-ratings for limitation of contact with others and self-care were only marginally higher than the observer ratings. Conclusions: The findings show that psychological capacity limitations occur in patients with neurological conditions. In clinical practice, limitations in each capacity dimension and discrepancies in patient- and clinician-ratings should be thoroughly assessed. This is especially relevant in patients with neurological conditions who have a potential tendency to underestimate or deny their disability.",2022,,Brain Impairment,,,1-15,,10.1017/brimp.2022.26,,#2291,Henning 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The benefits of physical exercise on state anxiety: Exploring possible mechanisms,"Herzog, Eva; Voß, Maria; Keller, Viktoria; Koch, Sophia; Takano, Keisuke; Cludius, Barbara","Although several studies have shown that one acute bout of physical exercise can reduce state anxiety in healthy samples, studies that examine this effect in subclinical and clinical samples are still rare and have found mixed results. In the present study, we investigated the effect of a single session of acute exercise on state anxiety in a subclinical sample with moderate to high anxiety sensitivity. Potential mediators, including self-efficacy, self-esteem, mindfulness, subjective vitality, rumination and emotional competencies were explored. Participants ( N = 88) with moderate to high anxiety sensitivity were assigned randomly to either an active group ( n = 44) or a control group ( n = 44). State anxiety and the mediator variables were assessed before and after the intervention. State anxiety was reduced from baseline to post-intervention, but no difference was found between groups. Exploratory analyses suggested that in the active intervention condition, a reduction in state anxiety was partly mediated by an increase in positive affect and mediated by an increase in subjective vitality. One acute bout of exercise might not be enough to decrease state anxiety in subclinical individuals with moderate to high anxiety sensitivity. However, the results of this study suggest that positive affect and subjective vitality could be two mechanisms that might explain the beneficial effect of exercise on anxiety. This should be further investigated in future studies. • Exercise does not reduce state anxiety more than a control condition. • Positive affect and subjective vitality mediate the reduction of state anxiety. • One bout of exercise is not sufficient to reduce anxiety in a subclinical sample.",2022,,Mental Health and Physical Activity,23,,100478,,10.1016/j.mhpa.2022.100478,,#2292,Herzog 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
How Expectations Shape the Formation of Intrusive Memories: An Experimental Study Using the Trauma Film Paradigm,"Herzog, Philipp; Barth, Charlotte; Rief, Winfried; Brakemeier, Eva-Lotta; Kube, Tobias","Abstract Background Although intrusions are the hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder, there is still limited knowledge about the processes that contribute to the development of intrusions. Here, we used the well-established trauma film paradigm (TFP) to investigate how expectations about the intensity and controllability of intrusions influence their occurrence. Methods 90 healthy participants underwent the TFP before they were randomized to one of three conditions manipulating their expectations about intrusions: positive expectations group; negative expectations group; control group. The primary outcome was the frequency and severity of intrusive memories as assessed with an intrusion diary over seven days. Results The TFP was well implemented, as indicated by significant post-film anxiety and a substantial number of intrusions reported for the subsequent week. The three groups did not differ in their expectations about intrusions and, relatedly, in their experience of intrusions. A mediation analysis revealed that the influence of post-film anxiety on intrusive memories was fully mediated by expectations. Conclusions Despite the failure of the expectation manipulation, the results of the mediation analysis support the hypothesis that post-film expectations influence the formation of intrusive memories, suggesting that intrusions may result from maladaptive dynamics between emotional and cognitive processes following trauma(like) experiences.",2022,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,46,4,809-826,,10.1007/s10608-022-10290-4,,#2293,Herzog 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,JD

Additionally, data on the reliability and validity of the Valued Living Questionnaire (VLQ) are reported. We analyzed the pre-, post-, and 6-month-follow-up-data of 3687 patients of a university psychotherapy outpatient clinic, most of which suffered from reliably diagnosed anxiety and mood disorders.

Over the course of therapy significant improvements in value-oriented action were found (d = .34), especially in treatment responders (d = .51). Increase of value-oriented action significantly explained satisfaction with life at end of treatment, even after controlling for symptom reduction. Temporally preceding improvement on the VLQ predicted further symptom reduction until follow-up.

While emotional abuse was associated with faster detection of negatively associated faces, emotional neglect was associated with an impaired recognition of familiar stimuli regardless of the emotional content.Results indicated that interindividual differences in cognitive biases may be due to the activation of diverse cognitive schemas based on differential experiences of maltreatment.",2020,,Frontiers in Psychology,11,,,,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00732,,#2300,Iffland 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD

This study investigated whether foster parents’ reports of their dyadic coping competencies differ from biological parents, whether there are differences with regard to the temporal associations between maternal and paternal dyadic coping in the two samples, and whether parental dyadic coping competencies predict future mental health problems in children. A total of 94 foster children and 157 children living in their biological families, both samples aged 2–7 years, as well as their (foster) parents were assessed three times over a 12-month period. The mothers’ and fathers’ dyadic coping competencies were assessed using the Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI). Child psychopathology was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and a standardized clinical interview (Kinder-DIPS), both mainly based on maternal report. Foster parents reported better dyadic coping competencies across the three assessments than did biological parents. There were no significant differences with regard to the temporal associations between mothers’ and fathers’ report over time between the two samples. Cross-lagged panel models yielded a high within person stability across the three assessments for both, mothers and fathers (actor effects), as well as some significant interpersonal effects primarily from paternal to maternal dyadic coping (partner effects). In contrast to the expectation, mothers’ and fathers’ dyadic coping did not predict child mental health problems at the third assessment.

First, a field study was conducted with N = 52 teachers and N = 1135 students. Structural equation modeling revealed an effect of student achievement on teacher judgments of student engagement and an effect of student engagement on teacher judgments of student achievement—above and beyond the association of each student characteristic with teacher judgments of that characteristic.

"The effects of student characteristics on teachers’ judgment accuracy: Disentangling ethnicity, minority status, and achievement.","Kaiser, Johanna; Südkamp, Anna; Möller, Jens","Teachers’ judgments of students’ academic achievement are not only affected by the achievement themselves but also by several other characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, and minority status. In real-life classrooms, achievement and further characteristics are often confounded. We disentangled achievement, ethnicity and minority status and examined whether the achievement of ethnic minority students is judged according to the predominant expectation (expectation hypothesis) and whether teachers’ judgment accuracy is influenced by students’ ethnicity or their minority status (ethnicity hypothesis or minority hypothesis). We conducted 4 experimental studies with a computer simulation (the Simulated Classroom). In Studies 1 and 2 with N = 34 and N = 30 participants, we implemented Turkish (Study 1) and Asian students (Study 2) as minorities. In contrast to the expectation hypothesis, the expectations attributed to the achievement of ethnic minority students did not bias teachers’ judgments. In both studies we found greater judgment accuracy for ethnic minority students, thereby probing the ethnicity hypothesis. In Study 3 with N = 48 participants, we further disentangled ethnicity and minority using German students as minority students, thus probing the minority hypothesis. Again, minority students were judged more accurately. Implementing gender (male vs. female) as the minority characteristic in Study 4, with N = 52 participants, yielded the same result: Minority students were judged more accurately, therefore supporting the minority hypothesis. Thus, classroom characteristics need to be considered in research on teachers’ judgment accuracy to clarify the influence of individual student characteristics and composition effects beyond individual effects.

Nature and evoked culture: Sex differences in personality are uniquely correlated with ecological stress,"Kaiser, Tim","Abstract Sex differences in personality were found to be larger in more developed and more gender-equal societies. However, the studies that report this effect either have methodological shortcomings or do not take into account possible underlying effects of ecological variables. Here, a large, multinational (N = 867,782) dataset of personality profiles was used to examine sex differences in Big Five facet scores for 50 countries. Gender differences were related to estimates of ecological stress as well as socio-cultural variables. Using a regularized partial-correlation approach, the unique associations of those correlates with sex differences were isolated. Sex differences were large (median Mahalanobis' D = 1.97) and varied substantially across countries (range 1.49 to 2.48). Global sex differences are larger in more developed countries with higher food availability, less pathogen prevalence, higher gender equality and an individualistic culture. After controlling for confounds, only cultural individualism, historic pathogen prevalence and food availability remained. Sex differences in personality are uniquely correlated to ecological stress.

Background: Chronically stressed people often suffer from anxiety and depressive mood. Hypnosis is a technique that can induce a relaxation response and reduce negative stress symptoms. Objective: This explorative study investigated the impact of a single relaxation hypnosis session on stress-related psychological symptoms. Method: 47 suggestible, stressed individuals (87 % female) were randomized to a hypnosis group ( n = 23, 20-minute hypnosis) or a control group ( n = 24, 20-minute scientific documentary). Before and after the intervention, we assessed perceived stress, negative affect, anxiety, and depressive mood.

Negative Priming in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and Schizophrenia: Association with Symptom Patterns,"Kathmann, Norbert; Bogdahn, Bettina; Endrass, Tanja","Negative priming (NP) is assumed to indicate the effect of an inhibitory mechanism in selective attention. Previous studies showed inconsistent reductions of the NP effect in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and schizophrenia. The aim of the present study was to relate NP alterations in two different NP tasks with specific symptom patterns of OCD and schizophrenia patients. Twenty-eight patients with a diagnosis of OCD, 27 patients with schizophrenia, and 27 healthy comparison participants performed a spatial and an identity priming task. Robust NP effects were found in the spatial priming task across groups and symptom patterns. However, OCD patients with a predominance of obsessive thoughts as well as schizophrenia patients with predominantly positive symptoms showed no identity NP effects, whereas OCD patients who primarily presented with compulsive rituals and schizophrenia patients with predominant negative symptoms tended to have increased identity NP compared to healthy participants. It is concluded that obsessions as well as positive psychotic symptoms are related to identity NP deficits possibly reflecting a shared basic cognitive mechanism leading to deficient thought control.",2013,,Journal of Experimental Psychopathology,4,4,405-419,,10.5127/jep.031512,,#2316,Kathmann 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Selfies reflect actual personality – Just like photos or short videos in standardized lab conditions,"Kaurin, Aleksandra; Heil, Lutz; Wessa, Michèle; Egloff, Boris; Hirschmüller, Sarah","Abstract Social media sites are overflowing with millions of selfies, because people increasingly share what they do and who they are with the rest of the world. We examined whether self-expressions based on selfies elicit enhanced, consensual and accurate interpersonal perceptions compared to commonly employed laboratory conditions. Perceived narcissism was relatively higher and conscientiousness lower when ratings were based on selfies. This effect did not extend to the accuracy of ratings: Across all conditions, unacquainted observers agreed with each other and their ratings were correlated with a criterion measure of target personality. Except for agreeableness and self-esteem, accuracy correlations were somewhat higher when ratings were based on selfies.

M162. FRONTO-STRIATAL-THALAMIC CIRCUITRY ABNORMALITIES IN WHITE MATTER TRACTS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH 22Q11.2 DELETION SYNDROME,"Heller, Carina; Steinmann, Saskia; Makris, Nikos; Charron, Lily; Antshel, Kevin M; Fremont, Wanda; Coman, Ioana L; Schweinberger, Stefan R; Weiß, Thomas; Bouix, Sylvain; Kubicki, Marek; Kates, Wendy; Shenton, Martha; Levitt, James; Kikinis, Zora","Abstract Background Cognitive decline is considered a fundamental component in schizophrenia. Abnormalities in fronto-striatal-thalamic (FST) sub-circuits are present in schizophrenia and are associated with cognitive impairments. However, it remains unknown whether abnormalities in FST sub-circuits are present before psychosis onset. This may be elucidated by investigating young adults with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), of whom 30% will develop schizophrenia in adulthood. In 22q11DS, cognitive decline, most pronounced in Verbal IQ (VIQ), precedes the onset of psychosis and those who develop psychosis diverge more strongly from a typical cognitive trajectory. Based on these findings, studies of young adults with 22q11DS without overt psychosis but with prodromal symptoms may increase our understanding of cognitive manifestations and early pathology in FST sub-circuits in schizophrenia. Here we examined white matter (WM) tracts in FST sub-circuits, especially those involving dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and their associations with VIQ in young adults with 22q11DS with and without prodromal symptoms. Methods We compared Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity (AD), and Radial Diffusivity (RD) in tracts of the FST sub-circuits in 21 individuals with 22q11DS with prodromal symptoms (age: M=21.43) and 30 individuals without prodromal symptoms (age: M=20.73) to 30 healthy controls (age: M=20.89). Two-tensor tractography was applied to reconstruct WM fiber tracts of the whole brain, followed by applying the White Matter Query Language (WMQL) method to select tracts between striatum and thalamus, with the rostral middle frontal gyrus (rMFG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), representing DLPFC and VLPFC. This yielded four tracts of interest: thalamus-rMFG, thalamus-IFG, striatum-rMFG, and striatum-IFG tracts. Additionally, correlations between the dMRI measures and scores on VIQ were performed. Results FA was significantly increased, while RD was significantly decreased in most WM tracts in both 22q11DS groups when compared to healthy controls. In the whole 22q11DS group, VIQ correlated negatively with FA in the right thalamus-IFG tract (r=-0.336, p=.018), while RD correlated positively with VIQ in the right thalamus-IFG tract (r=0.290, p=.043) in individuals with 22q11DS, such that increased FA and decreased RD were associated with a lower VIQ. We followed up on the results in individuals with 22q11DS with prodromal symptoms to determine whether the presence of prodromal symptoms drove the correlations. VIQ correlated significantly with FA (r=-0.491, p=0.024, FDR-adjusted=0.048) and significantly at trend level with RD (r=0.487, p=0.025, FDR-adjusted=0.050) in the right thalamus-IFG tract in individuals with 22q11DS with prodromal symptoms. Discussion Microstructural abnormalities in brain WM tracts connecting the thalamus and the striatum with prefrontal cortices are present in young adults with 22q11DS with and without prodromal symptoms compared to healthy controls. These abnormalities are associated with the individuals’ cognitive performance in VIQ in individuals with 22q11DS with prodromal symptoms and therefore emphasize the potential involvement of the FST sub-circuits in schizophrenia. While changes in FST circuitry have been reported in patients with schizophrenia, we observed that changes in FST circuitry are also present in young adults with 22q11DS at risk for but without psychotic symptoms. Our results suggest that psychosis onset in 22q11DS may be associated with a complex pattern of WM alterations. Furthermore, cognitive abnormalities, especially in VIQ, present an important preclinical risk factor for psychosis in 22q11DS.",2020,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,46,Supplement_1,S197-S198,,10.1093/schbul/sbaa030.474,,#2320,Heller 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
ODP029 Associations between Objective and Subjective Indicators of Stress and Sleep Disturbance in Adolescents and Young Adults from the General Population,"Kische, Hanna; Voss, Catharina; Pieper, Lars; Beesdo-Baum, Katja","Abstract Background Sleep is a complex and dynamic vital state, occupying one third of human's lifetime. Disturbed sleep can be a symptom of and a risk factor for a wide range of mental disorders and somatic diseases. One pathway through which sleep problems may lead to health problems is by dysregulation of the body's physiological stress response system as indicated by aberrant cortisol. Previous findings showed that poor sleep quality and sleep disruption were associated with elevated cortisol levels in adults. Regarding adolescents, there is evidence that sleep problems are linked to hyper-reactivity to stress with effects being stronger in girls than boys. In addition, adolescence itself was associated with decreased sleep quality and an increase in perceived stress dependent on age. However, little evidence is available for the association between objective and subjective stress markers and sleep in the daily life of adolescents from the general population. The aim of this study was to examine the association between 1) cortisol and 2) subjective stress with sleep in adolescents and young adults. Methods We used baseline data (11/2015–12/2016) of the Behavior and Mind Health(BeMIND) study, an epidemiological study based on a random community sample of individuals aged 14 to 21 years (Dresden, Germany, N = 1,180). We assessed sleep disturbance with the short form of the PROMIS Sleep-Disturbance questionnaire (8 items) via Ecological Momentary Assessment, conducted on four days directly after awakening, calculated mean. Cortisol was measured in hair (pg/mg) and saliva (nmol/l). Cortisol awakening response and total cortisol were calculated. Subjective stress was assessed via 1) the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), 2) the Trier Inventory of the Assessment of Chronic Stress-Screening (TICS), and 3) two items for time urgency (subjective stress in school/at work/university and leisure, self-developed). Weighted linear regressions with robust standard errors were performed after exclusions (n = 1132, 48.4% female). Models were adjusted for sex, age, pubertal development and rerun in sex-specific analyses. Results Mean age was 17.83 (SD 0. 07). Neither hair, nor saliva cortisol was associated with PROMIS Sleep (hair cortisol: unstandardized β-coefficient: -0. 002, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0. 012; 0. 007). All analyzed subjective stress variables were associated with PROMIS Sleep. We found positive associations between PSS (β-coefficient: 0.151, 95% CI: 0.117; 0.183), TICS (β-coefficient: 0. 056, 95% CI: 0. 045; 0. 066), and time urgency (β-coefficient: 0.114, 95% CI: 0. 061; 0.166) with sleep. There was no evidence for sex-specific effects. Conclusion Results confirmed the association between perceived stress and sleep in a population-based study with adolescents and young adults, that was previously shown mainly in adults. No evidence for a link between cortisol and sleep was found. Further analyses would benefit from a longitudinal perspective and consideration of mediating/moderation variables to elucidate the complex interplay between stress and sleep.

Assessing Procrastination,"Klein, Eva M.; Beutel, Manfred E.; Müller, Kai W.; Wölfling, Klaus; Brähler, Elmar; Zenger, Markus","Abstract. The short form of the General Procrastination Scale (GPS-K; Klingsieck &amp; Fries, 2012 ; Lay, 1986 ) is a reliable self-report scale measuring general procrastination. The presumed one-dimensional factor structure of the scale, however, has never been examined. Thus, the purposes of this representative study were to examine its dimensionality and factorial invariance across age and sex, and to provide norm values of the German general population. The GPS-K was administered to a representative community sample ( N = 2,527; age range 14–95 years). A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted. To explore convergent validity, standardized scales of distress and life satisfaction were used. Measurement invariance across sex and age was tested. The CFA revealed an unsatisfactory model fit of the presumed unidimensional factor structure of the GPS-K. Therefore, a 5-item one-dimensional version of the scale was suggested (General Procrastination Scale – Screening; GPS-S). Correlations between GPS-S, distress and reduced life satisfaction provide evidence on its convergent validity. The one-dimensional GPS-S can be assumed to be scalar invariant across sex and for participants older than 29 years. The scale can be administered in only a few minutes providing an economic screening for research and practice.",2019,,European Journal of Psychological Assessment,35,5,633-640,,10.1027/1015-5759/a000441,,#2327,Klein 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Methodology: We recruited 338 individuals (19–27 y, 59 % female) from a random community sample with NR, SR, or no DSM-5 addictive disorder. Predictors were the Big Five personality traits (NEO-FFI) and reward and punishment sensitivity (BIS/BAS questionnaire). Outcomes were the slopes of addictive behaviours (i. e., quantity, frequency, and number of DSM-5 criteria) over three years. Bayesian multiple regressions were used to analyse the probabilities for each hypothesis. Results: The evidence that higher neuroticism, lower conscientiousness, lower agreeableness, higher extraversion, lower openness, higher reward sensitivity, and lower punishment sensitivity predict increased addictive behaviours over time was, overall, moderate to high (69 % to 99 %) and varied by trait and outcome. Predictive associations were mostly higher for NR compared with SR addictive behaviours. Conclusions: Personality traits predict the course of addictive behaviours, but associations were only about half as large as expected. While some personality traits, such as lower conscientiousness, predict increases in both NR and SR addictive behaviours over time, others, such as lower punishment sensitivity, seem to specifically predict increases in NR addictive behaviours.",2022,,SUCHT,68,5,263-277,,10.1024/0939-5911/a000780,,#2334,Kräplin 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Retest reliabilities of decision-making and cognitive control measures in addictive disorders,"Kräplin, Anja; Scherbaum, Stefan; Bühringer, Gerhard; Goschke, Thomas","Abstract. Aims: Longitudinal and intervention studies are needed on impaired decision-making and cognitive control deficits as putative risk factors for Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders (SAD). Adequate stability of measures is essential for this approach. To improve our knowledge, we aimed 1) to analyse retest reliabilities of such behavioural measures and 2) to compare retest reliabilities between SAD and controls. Methods: In a quasi-experimental design we recruited a convenience sample of three groups: A Gambling Disorder group (n = 26), a Nicotine Dependence group (n = 42), both diagnosed according to DSM-IV, and a healthy control group (n = 52). Participants performed two test sessions within 3 – 4 weeks with six tasks assessing decision-making and cognitive control. Results: Retest reliabilities, indicated by intraclass correlation coefficients, varied extremely between tasks and parameters ranging from 0.31 (poor) to 0.82 (excellent) with the majority ranging from 0.40 (fair) to 0.74 (good). Importantly, retest reliabilities differed significantly between the SAD groups and the control group. Conclusions: Retest reliabilities of decision-making and cognitive control measures are adequate for longitudinal and intervention studies of SAD, although tasks parameters should be selected carefully. However, group differences in retest reliabilities may result in misleading group and intervention effects. To minimize measurement error, studies investigating longitudinal designs may apply latent variable models.",2016,,SUCHT,62,4,191-202,,10.1024/0939-5911/a000430,,#2336,Kräplin 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Assessing Collaborative Behavior in Students,"Krkovic, Katarina; Wüstenberg, Sascha; Greiff, Samuel","Abstract. Skilful collaborative problem-solving is becoming increasingly important in various life areas. However, researchers are still seeking ways to assess and foster this skill in individuals. In this study, we developed a computer-assisted assessment for collaborative behavior (COLBAS) following the experiment-based assessment of behavior approach (objective personality tests; Cattell, 1958 ). The instrument captures participants’ collaborative behavior in problem-solving tasks using the MicroDYN approach while participants work collaboratively with a computer-agent. COLBAS can thereby assess problem-solving and collaborative behavior expressed through communication acts. To investigate its validity, we administered COLBAS to 483 German seventh graders along with MicroDYN as a measure of individual problem-solving skills and questions regarding the motivation to collaborate. A latent confirmatory factor analysis suggested a five-dimensional construct with two problem-solving dimensions (knowledge acquisition and knowledge application) and three collaboration dimensions (questioning, asserting, and requesting). The results showed that extending MicroDYN to include collaborative aspects did not considerably change the measurement of problem-solving. Finally, students who were more motivated to collaborate interacted more with the computer-agent but also obtained worse problem-solving results.",2016,,European Journal of Psychological Assessment,32,1,52-60,,10.1027/1015-5759/a000329,,#2339,Krkovic 2016,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"Factorial invariance of the Emotion-Dysregulation-Scale for Canadian and German treatment-seeking adults with borderline personality disorder, major depression or substance dependence","Kröger, Christoph; Schulz, Julia; Kosfelder, Joachim; Schweiger, Ulrich; McMain, Shelley; Kliem, Sören","• A deficit in emotion regulation is thought to be as a trans-diagnostic factor of mental disorders . • Canadian and German clinical samples completed several self-report measures, including the Emotional-Dysregulation-Scale . • Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses indicated at least partial measurement invariance . • Psychometric properties were found to be appropriate and results can be compared cross-nationally. A deficit in emotion regulation is thought to be a trans-diagnostic factor of several mental disorders and is mostly assessed by using self-report measures. Comparing values and results cross-nationally presupposes that these scores are based on the invariance of psychometric properties. The present study aims to compare the psychometric properties and the factorial invariance of the Emotional-Dysregulation-Scale (ED-Scale) cross-nationally. Analyses were based on data of treatment-seeking Canadian and German clinical samples ( n = 144; n = 115). They were diagnosed using structured clinical interviews and completed self-report measures. We calculated reliability and validity indices. In order to determine the factorial invariance (configural, metric, scalar, and residual invariance), we conducted several multi-group confirmatory factor analyses. For both samples, Cronbach’s α s proved to be excellent. Convergent, divergent and discriminant validity were supported. Comparing increasingly stringent models, tests of measurement invariance indicated at least partial measurement invariance . These findings suggest that the ED-Scale operates in a similar fashion among English and German-speaking clinical samples. Therefore, we conclude that the psychometric properties of the ED-Scale are appropriate and that results can be compared cross-nationally. Future research should examine the measurement invariance in different cultures and ethnic minority groups.",2014,,Personality and Individual Differences,71,,124-129,,10.1016/j.paid.2014.07.031,,#2342,Kröger 2014,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Depression is not related to deficits in emotional reasoning skills,"Kube, Tobias; Friehs, Thilo; Glombiewski, Julia Anna; Gollwitzer, Mario","Several lines of research have examined whether people with depressive symptoms have deficits in social-cognitive abilities, such as emotional reasoning skills. While many depressed people report having such deficits, it is less clear whether depressive symptoms are related to actual objective performance deficits. We examined the relationship between emotional reasoning skills (as assessed with the TEMINT) and depressive symptoms (i.e., BDI-II) in a mini meta-analysis of 11 studies with data from 1503 participants with varying levels of depression, from healthy people to clinical samples with severely depressed people. Using a random effects approach, we found a small but significant correlation between depressive symptoms and TEMINT performance (mean r z = 0.065), indicating that depressive symptoms were associated with higher emotional reasoning skills. These findings suggest that depression is unrelated to deficits in emotional reasoning, though assessed with only one test. If anything, depressive symptoms are associated with improved performance in the TEMINT. The current results point to a discrepancy between depressed people's self-evaluation of their abilities (as shown in previous research) and their actual performance. Our findings also have practical implications as they suggest that clinicians may focus on modifying depressed people's negative views of themselves, rather than on improving their skills. • Objective: to examine the association of depression and emotional reasoning skills • Depression was not related to deficits in emotional reasoning skills ( n = 1503). • Conclusion: People with depression may systematically underestimate their abilities • Clinicians may focus on improving depressed people's self-view rather than skills.",2022,,Personality and Individual Differences,196,,111728,,10.1016/j.paid.2022.111728,,#2344,Kube 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
How Depressive Symptoms Hinder Positive Information Processing: An Experimental Study on the Interplay of Cognitive Immunisation and Negative Mood in the Context of Expectation Adjustment,"Kube, Tobias; Glombiewski, Julia Anna","Abstract Background People with depression maintain negative expectations despite disconfirming positive experiences by reappraising or discarding novel positive information, referred to as “cognitive immunisation”. A second body of literature suggests that negative mood can negatively affect information processing. Bridging these two lines of research, the present study examined the interplay of cognitive immunisation and negative mood in the context of expectation modification. Methods In a student sample ( N = 152), we used a well-established experimental paradigm to examine the adjustment of performance expectations in response to positive performance feedback, and its relation to depressive symptoms. In a 2 × 2 design, participants received either a negative mood induction, a cognitive immunisation manipulation, both, or no further manipulation. Results Participants from all experimental groups revised their previous expectations significantly in line with positive performance feedback. However, depressive symptoms were a negative predictor of expectation adjustment, and a moderation analysis indicated that this effect was particularly pronounced if participants underwent the negative mood induction. Conclusions Consistent with previous work, depressive symptoms were associated with a reduced ability to integrate positive information. Furthermore, our results suggest that the activation of negative mood in people with elevated levels of depression may hamper learning from new positive experience.",2020,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,45,3,517-528,,10.1007/s10608-020-10191-4,,#2345,Kube 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Further Specifying the Cognitive Model of Depression: Situational Expectations and Global Cognitions as Predictors of Depressive Symptoms,"Kube, Tobias; Herzog, Philipp; Michalak, Charlotte M.; Glombiewski, Julia A.; Doering, Bettina K.; Rief, Winfried","The cognitive model of depression assumes that depressive symptoms are influenced by dysfunctional cognitions. To further specify this model, the present study aimed to examine the influence of different types of cognitions on depressive symptoms, i.e., situational expectations and global cognitions. It was hypothesized that situational expectations predict depressive symptoms beyond global cognitions. The present study examined a clinical (N = 91) and a healthy sample (N = 80) using longitudinal data with a baseline assessment and a follow-up five months later. Although the study was not designed as an interventional trial, participants from the clinical study received non-manualized cognitive-behavioral treatment after the baseline assessment. We examined situational expectations, intermediate beliefs, dispositional optimism, and generalized expectancies for negative mood regulation as predictors of depressive symptoms. Hypotheses were tested using multiple hierarchical linear regression analyses. Results indicate that, although there were significant correlations between the cognitive factors and depressive symptoms, in both samples neither global cognitions, nor situational expectations significantly predicted depressive symptoms at the five-month follow-up. The present study could, contrary to the hypotheses, not provide evidence for a significant impact of cognitive vulnerabilities on depressive symptoms, presumably due to high drop-out rates at follow-up. Limitations of the study and directions for future research are critically discussed. Situational and global cognitions were examined as predictors of depressive symptoms. In a healthy and a clinical sample, cognitive factors were correlated with depressive symptoms. However, in both samples depressive symptoms at follow-up were not predicted by cognitive factors. Situational and global cognitions were examined as predictors of depressive symptoms. In a healthy and a clinical sample, cognitive factors were correlated with depressive symptoms.

Unlike traditional learning models, we hypothesized a tipping point in which the discrepancy between expectation and outcome becomes so large that new information is perceived as lacking credibility, thus entailing little updating of expectations. Consistent with the hypothesized tipping point, new information was deemed most valid if it was moderately positive. Moreover, descriptively, expectation update was largest for moderate expectation violations, but this effect was small (Study 2) or even nonsignificant (Study 1).

The aims of the current analogue study were to develop and to validate English and German versions of the DOCS-SF. In the online surveys, 304 German and 187 English-speaking students participated. In addition to the DOCS-SF, they answered a battery of established questionnaires on OCD, depression and anxiety. For determining retest reliability, 51 German students participated in another survey. Results confirmed the single factor structure of the DOCS-SF and indicated good internal consistency (α = 0.89) as well as retest reliability (r = 0.75). Concerning convergent validity, the DOCS-SF was strongly correlated with other OCD scales. Although correlations with anxiety were strong as well, correlations with measures of depression, health anxiety, disgust, and health-related well-being were significantly weaker.

Both a model with a general factor and method effect of items with negative wording and a unidimensional model were tested for structure validity. Measurement equivalence and latent mean comparisons were conducted across the samples. The SOC-L9 showed good reliability and validity in all countries. Rather than the unidimensional model, the model with additional method effect showed excellent fit across countries. Cross-national measurement invariance testing found partial strong measurement invariance across the three samples. The latent means of the SOC-L9 in the US sample were higher than those in German and Russian samples.

"Bullies Get Away With It, But Not Everywhere: Mental Health Sequelae of Bullying in Chinese and German Students","Lin, Muyu; Wolke, Dieter; Schneider, Silvia; Margraf, Jürgen","Bullying victimization is associated with adverse mental health consequences, while bullies suffer few or no adverse consequences in Western societies. Yet the universality of these consequences across western and eastern cultures is unknown. The current study investigated retrospective bullying experience in primary and secondary schools and its effects on adult mental health (depression, anxiety, stress, lifetime suicidal behavior, positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, and sense of control) in 5,012 Chinese and 1,935 German university students. School bullying victimization was far less frequently recalled by the Chinese sample (6.2%–12.6%) than the German sample (29.3%–37.0%), but victims had similar adverse mental health in both countries. In Germany, bullies and not-involved had equally good mental health, whereas bullies in China had poor mental health comparable to victims.

Overregulation in Physical Education – Teaching Behavior Effects on Self-Regulated Motor Learning,"Lindberg, Sven; Hasselhorn, Marcus; Lehmann, Martin","This study examines students’ use of self-regulated motor learning strategies related to a congruent or incongruent teacher-student fit-constellation of perceived and preferred teaching behavior. In a cross-sectional study in German grammar schools, 1452 students and 18 physical education teachers participated. The results of the study indicate that students apply more self-regulated motor learning strategies in specific fit-constellation. In addition, when the teachers’ self-perception of teaching behavior exceeds the respective perception and preference of the students, this overregulation impairs the satisfaction with and interest in physical education as well as self-regulated motor learning",2013,,International Journal of Learning and Development,3,3,19,,10.5296/ijld.v3i3.3557,,#2354,Lindberg 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The Influence of Perceived Teacher-Student Congruence on Students’ Satisfaction in Physical Education,"Lindberg, Sven; Hasselhorn, Marcus; Lehmann, Martin","The purpose of this study was to adapt the Leadership Scale for Sports (LSS; Chelladurai &amp; Saleh, 1980) to physical education (PE) classes, for measuring teacher behavior by taking consideration of the perspectives of students and teachers. We moreover examined the influence of teacher behavior and the perceived teacher-student congruence on the satisfaction of students. Two cross-sectional studies, an online survey with PE teachers and a school study where students responded to a questionnaire assessing students’ perception and the preferred teacher behavior and teachers fill in a self-description form regarding their own behavior. Participants for study 1 were 527 PE teachers (254 females and 273 males), aged 21-64 years ( M = 42.11; SD = 11.21). Participants in study 2 were 1452 students (625 females, 798 males and 29 unstated), aged 9-17 years ( M = 13.31; SD = 1.49) and 18 PE teachers (8 females and 10 males), age 28-60 years ( M = 49.87; SD = 14.99). Confirmatory factor analysis and the reliability coefficients supported the view that the LSS is adequate for usage in PE. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that teacher behavior influences the satisfaction of students. Moreover, perceived teacher-student congruence had a positive effect on students’ satisfaction. The findings support the assumption that the LSS is a suitable instrument for an application in PE. Teachers should be concerned with their students’ perception of their preferred teaching behavior in order to adapt to their needs and to foster their satisfaction with, and interest in, PE.",2013,,Journal of Studies in Education,3,2,,,10.5296/jse.v3i2.3555,,#2355,Lindberg 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Gender Differences in Children’s Math Self-Concept in the First Years of Elementary School,"Lindberg, Sven; Linkersdörfer, Janosch; Ehm, Jan-Henning; Hasselhorn, Marcus; Lonnemann, Jan","In the course of elementary school children start to develop an academic self-concept reflecting their motivation, thoughts, and feelings about a specific domain. For the domain of mathematics, gender differences can emerge which are characterized by a less pronounced math self-concept for girls. However, studies are rather sparse regarding the early years of elementary school education, hence, the point in time when such gender differences emerge yet remains a matter of debate. In our study, we found that the math self-concept of elementary school children (n = 81) declined from first to second grade. While no differences in math achievement were observed between girls and boys, it became apparent that girls’ math self-concept was already less pronounced than the math self-concept of boys in the first years of elementary school.

Narcissistic self-promotion is not moderated by the strength of situational cues,"Maaß, Ulrike; Ziegler, Matthias","The present study examined whether situational differences moderate the influence of narcissism on self-promotion. As the strong situation hypothesis would assume, personality influences would be lowest in strong situations that include clear cues for self-promotion. Therefore, 219 participants received different situational cues (no prime, subliminal prime, or explicit request to self-present) prior to the task to self-describe. We rated the self-descriptions to the degree of a favorable and narcissistic impression (in an agentic or communal way). Results showed that all participants promoted themselves more favorably and narcissistically in situations with an explicit request only. The impact of narcissism on self-promotion was invariant across conditions. It was concluded that narcissism leads to enhanced self-promotion irrespective of situational strength. Implications for the way we study the strong situation hypothesis are discussed.",2017,,Personality and Individual Differences,104,,482-488,,10.1016/j.paid.2016.09.008,,#2361,Maaß 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
A Pilot Study on the Effect of an Energy Drink on Interoception in 					High vs. Low Anxiety Sensitivity Individuals,"Mai-Lippold, Sandra A.; Dettlinger, Clara M.; Khalsa, Sahib S.; Pollatos, Olga","Abstract. Background: The market for energy drinks has grown quickly over the past 20 years. While the physiological and psychological effects of different ingredients have been studied, the influence of energy drinks on interoceptive processes is unclear. Anxiety has been associated with amplified interoceptive functioning, suggesting potentially exaggerated reactions to energy drinks. Aims: Investigate the effect of energy drink consumption and anxiety sensitivity (AS) as well as their possible interactions on cardiorespiratory dimensions of interoception. Method: Thirty-nine healthy students consumed an energy drink via a placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, crossover design. Cardiac and respiratory interoceptive accuracy (IAcc), interoceptive sensibility (IS), and interoceptive evaluation (IE) were assessed. Heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs) were analyzed to evaluate neural processing of the heartbeat. Results: Consumption of one energy drink did not influence IAcc, IS, or IE. However, high AS subjects reported reduced interoceptive confidence after energy drink intake. While HEP amplitudes did not differ depending on the type of drink, high AS subjects showed reduced HEPs overall compared to low AS subjects. Heart rate was significantly lower following energy drink consumption as compared to the placebo condition. Limitations: The sample size was small, energy dosages low, and physiological parameters should be assessed in more detail. Conclusion: Energy drink consumption was associated with an interoceptive bias in high AS individuals suggesting possible interaction effects between changes in physical state, interoception, and anxiety.",2020,,European Journal of Health Psychology,27,4,171-187,,10.1027/2512-8442/a000061,,#2362,Mai-Lippold 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Validation of the URICA-S in Group Therapy: Associations of Stages of Change with Therapeutic Factors and Treatment Outcome,"Mander, Johannes; Vogel, Eva; Blanck, Paul; Bents, Hinrich","Stages of change could be driving forces to activate the realization of therapeutic factors and symptom change. Consequently, the aims of the present study were to investigate whether the stages of change concept is valid in group therapy settings shown by factor analysis, internal consistencies, and criterion validity. A total of 377 patients completed measures of stages of change, symptom change, and therapeutic factors. A confirmatory factor analysis replicated the stages of change factors for group therapy. Related to the criterion validity, stages of change demonstrated only low, non-significant associations with symptom change, but some stages of change were significant predictors of certain therapeutic factors.

The patient perspective on therapeutic change: The investigation of associations between stages of change and general mechanisms of change in psychotherapy research.,"Mander, Johannes; Wittorf, Andreas; Klingberg, Stefan; Teufel, Martin; Zipfel, Stephan; Sammet, Isa","In this study, we explored intersections between two influential integrative frameworks in psychotherapy research. Specifically, we analyzed associations between stages of change from Prochaska’s transtheoretical model and general mechanisms of change from Grawe’s psychological therapy in a longitudinal design. Our central hypothesis, which we could derive from theorectical concepts of both frameworks, was as follows: Experiential change mechanisms (emotional bond, problem actuation, and clarification of meaning) should be especially relevant in early stages of change (precontemplation and contemplation), and behavioral change mechanisms (resource activation, mastery, and agreement on collaboration) should be especially relevant in late stages of change (action and maintenance). Therefore, 253 inpatients completed the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment, short version (URICA-S), the Scale for the Multiperspective Assessment of General Change Mechanisms in Psychotherapy (SACiP), and diverse outcome measures in early, middle, and late stages of psychotherapy. Crosslagged panel analyses and multilevel analyses partially supported our hypothesis and revealed trends for interactive effects between change mechanisms and stages of change in outcome prediction. More specifically, our results suggest that experiences of both experiential and behavioral change mechanisms predicted increases in the action stage of change. Contemplation predicted increases in behavioral change mechanisms experiences.

Emerging Street Youth Violent Groups in Musoma: What is the Role of Individual Parents’ Socio-Economic Status (SES)?,"Masath, Faustine","This study presents findings regarding violence among emerging street youth violent groups in Musoma, Tanzania using a total sample of 94 (M = 20.02 years, SD = 4.05) respondents purposefully selected from four violent groups. Specific objectives included: examining the variation in violence involvement among the violent groups; establishing the level of relationship between individual parents’ SES and the level of violent behaviour among the members of the violent groups; and examining to determine if individual parents’ SES is a significant predictor of the development of violence among members of the violent groups. Findings revealed higher level of involvement in violent behaviours among groups (M = 70.85, SD = 11.14). The ANOVA results indicated a statistical significant difference [F (3, 90) = 6.035, p = 0.001] in the mean scores of the level of involvement in violent behaviour among the violent groups comprised of members drawn from different socio-economic status. The contribution of parents’ socio-economic status (SES) on individual’s violent behaviours measured by multiple regression analysis was weak (R² =.112, p =.161). Thus, parents’ SES is a weak and non-statistical significant predictor for individual’s involvement in violence and violent acts.

Prevalence of and factors contributing to violent discipline in families and its association with violent discipline by teachers and peer violence,"Masath, Faustine Bwire; Nkuba, Mabula; Hecker, Tobias","Using a multi-informant approach, we assessed 914 children (mean age = 12.58 years, standard deviation [SD] = 1.43) and 893 caregivers (98.3 per cent female, mean age = 40.07 years, SD = 11.46) in Tanzania. Results showed that 93.3 per cent (n = 828/893) of caregivers reported using violent discipline, while 91.0 per cent (n = 832/914) of the children experienced it in their families. Further, 95.0 per cent (n = 868/914) and 93.7 per cent (n = 853/914) of students experienced violent discipline by teachers and peer violence at school, respectively.

Social comparison modulates acute responses to traumatic footage and the development of intrusive memories,"Meyer, Thomas; Morina, Nexhmedin","The psychosocial environment is pivotal for the adjustment to traumatic experiences, yet the role of social cognition in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains obscure. We theorize that comparison with other trauma survivors reporting high or low levels of stress-related symptomatology might attenuate or amplify the development of PTSD, depending on perceived similarities with the standard. 90 healthy participants viewed traumatic footage and read ostensible testimonials from a fellow participant from a similar background, reporting high levels of PTSD symptoms (i.e. a similar-vulnerable social comparator), low distress (similar-resilient) or by a demographically dissimilar person reporting low distress (different-resilient). A separate no-comparison group ( n = 30) served to gauge the presence of assimilative responding. Relative to similar-vulnerable comparison, a similar-resilient comparator tended to attenuate acute negative affect, but this did not translate to a similar effect on seven-day intrusive memories. Here, the similar-vulnerable group tended to report fewer intrusive memories compared to control, indicating a contrastive response. Taken together, we provide preliminary evidence that social comparison modulates the adjustment to adversity, whereby acute affect and intrusion development may be influenced differentially.",2022,,Journal of Experimental Psychopathology,13,1,204380872210758,,10.1177/20438087221075889,,#2371,Meyer 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Individual differences in spatial configuration learning predict the occurrence of intrusive memories,"Meyer, Thomas; Smeets, Tom; Giesbrecht, Timo; Quaedflieg, Conny W. E. M.; Girardelli, Marta M.; Mackay, Georgina R. N.; Merckelbach, Harald","The dual-representation model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Brewin, Gregory, Lipton, & Burgess, Psychological Review, 117, 210-232 2010) argues that intrusions occur when people fail to construct context-based representations during adverse experiences. The present study tested a specific prediction flowing from this model. In particular, we investigated whether the efficiency of temporal-lobe-based spatial configuration learning would account for individual differences in intrusive experiences and physiological reactivity in the laboratory. Participants (N = 82) completed the contextual cuing paradigm, which assesses spatial configuration learning that is believed to depend on associative encoding in the parahippocampus. They were then shown a trauma film. Afterward, startle responses were quantified during presentation of trauma reminder pictures versus unrelated neutral and emotional pictures. PTSD symptoms were recorded in the week following participation. Better configuration learning performance was associated with fewer perceptual intrusions, r = −.33, p < .01, but was unrelated to physiological responses to trauma reminder images (ps > .46) and had no direct effect on intrusion-related distress and overall PTSD symptoms, rs > −.12, ps > .29. However, configuration learning performance tended to be associated with reduced physiological responses to unrelated negative images, r = −.20, p = .07.

Development and preliminary validation of the sports competition rumination scale (SCRS),"Michel-Kröhler, Alena; Krys, Sabrina; Berti, Stefan","This article presents the development and the preliminary validation of the Sports Competition Rumination Scale (SCRS). The SCRS is designed to measure ruminative thoughts referring to competition-related problems in athletes. It is an adapted version of an existing rumination scale in which we have changed the context for sport-specific purposes. The SCRS consists of eight items, which capture key characteristics of rumination (e.g., repetitiveness, intrusiveness) in the competitive context. In two studies, we investigated its construct validity in terms of its factorial validity and its position within a nomological network. Data collected from 355 athletes (NStudy1 = 157, NStudy2 = 198) revealed a good factorial validity for the scale across samples. The SCRS showed a good internal consistency. Moreover, moderate relations to established rumination measures from clinical and general psychology supported its position in the nomological network. In addition, the SCRS showed low to moderate relations to different general as well as sports-specific anxiety measures. The present study provides an important preliminary evidence for a useful, reliable, and ecological measure of rumination about competition-related problems.Lay Summary: Repetitive and intrusive thoughts (rumination) are a prominent topic in psychology due to the strong relation to depression, individuals’ well-being, and various performance parameters. However, little research has focused on rumination in the context of sports.

Caregiver-specific factors and orphanage-context factors contributing to maltreatment of children in institutional care: A multi-level analysis of 24 orphanages in Tanzania,"Mkinga, Getrude; Kirika, Anette; Nkuba, Mabula; Mgode, Simeon; Huth, Mira; Hecker, Tobias","Background: High rates of maltreatment and low caregiving quality in institutional care settings have been identified in various low-and middle-income countries. Many studies have focused on children living in institutions. Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of maltreatment, caregiver-specific, orphanage-context factors, and their relation to maltreatment of orphans from the caregivers’ perspective. Participants and setting: In this cross-sectional study, 227 caregivers (67% female) with a mean age of 36.84 years ( SD age = 12.89) of 24 childcare centres in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania participated. Methods: The primary outcome was the maltreatment of children assessed through structured interviews of caregivers. Further information on individual (like work-related stress) and structural variables (working conditions) was gathered. Results: Caregivers’ work under extreme and exhausting conditions, with very high caregiver-child ratios, low salaries, and almost no possibility to recover. Results also showed significant differences in the maltreatment level and structural and individual factors (e.g., payment and days of entitlement) between the orphanages. Caregiver’s positive attitudes towards violence ( ƒ 2 attitudes = 0.19) and difficulties in the relationship with children ( ƒ 2 relationship = 0.05) significantly predicted maltreatment with moderate and small effects. Conclusions: The overall poor working conditions highlight the urgent need to reduce the caregivers’ burden. In addition to this, addressing caregivers’ positive attitudes and improving their interaction competencies with children may be a starting point to prevent maltreatment of children. Further investigation of structural factors contributing to maltreatment is essential to develop recommendations for the improvement and re-organization of childcare institutions.",2022,,Developmental Child Welfare,4,2,154-173,,10.1177/25161032221099979,,#2377,Mkinga 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Measuring Appearance-Related Comparisons: Validation of the Comparison Standards Scale for Appearance,"Morina, Nexhmedin; McCarthy, Peter; Meyer, Thomas; Schlechter, Pascal","Abstract Background Humans constantly compare their attributes to different reference frames. According to the theoretical framework of the general comparative-processing model, such comparisons may be perceived as aversive (i.e., appraised as threatening the motives of the comparer) or appetitive (i.e., appraised as consonant with, or positively challenging the motives). However, we lack a measure that adequately captures multi-standard comparisons. Methods Considering appearance-related comparisons as a relevant comparison domain, we introduce the Comparison Standards Scale for Appearance (CSS-A) that assesses appearance-related social, temporal, counterfactual, criteria-based, and dimensional upward and downward comparisons regarding their (a) frequency, (b) perceived discrepancy, and (c) engendered affect. We administered the CSS-A to 1121 participants, along with measures of appearance social comparison, body satisfaction, physical self-concept, self-esteem, well-being, and depression. Results A two-factor model ( aversive and appetitive comparisons ) fit the data better than a bifactor model with an additional general domain-factor ( comparative thinking ). The validity of the CSS-A was supported by correlations with external validators beyond appearance, social comparison, and body satisfaction.

Individuals with work anxiety are at risk for long-term sick leave and create high costs for society, companies, and their own work biography. Understanding psychological return-to-work predictors is important for early reintegration of these persons into the work context. This longitudinal study for the first time investigates the predictive value of workplace perception and objective work ability impairment for future sick leave duration in persons with work anxiety. The investigation was carried out with 103 individuals with work anxieties. They were of working age and confronted with a return-to-work situation after somatic illness. Work ability impairment was assessed in a structured interview by a state-licensed sociomedical specialist using the established Mini-ICF-APP Scale. Participants completed a questionnaire on their workplace perception (KFZA). The degree of work ability impairment (Mini-ICF-APP) was predictive of longer sick leave as well as workplace perception (KFZA dimensions scope of action, social support, need for cooperation).

Group therapists: combine alliance building with paying specific attention to the patient’s perception,"Muschalla, Beate","Abstract In slow-open groups as well as therapies of less than ten sessions, each group session holds importance. Patients, therapists and co-therapists have different perspectives and may gain different experiences from a group session. This study investigates the perspectives of patients, therapists and co-therapists on alliance, new insights and therapist techniques in the same group session. Do the three actors perceive these group aspects similarly or differently? Which group aspects are related with the outcome coping? One hundred and forty-nine sessions of a cognitive behaviour therapy group have been investigated. Patients, therapists and co-therapists gave ratings on their perceived alliance, group topics and insights as well as therapists’ technique competency. Concerning new insights, there was concordance between patients and co-therapists ( r = .211, p &lt; .05). Concerning alliance, there was a concordance between patients and therapists ( r = .327, p &lt; .01). Therapists focusing on alliance building was associated with lower patient outcomes in terms of work coping (β = –.391). The quality of therapeutic techniques was the same in groups with higher and lower outcomes. Patients’ perception of whether they felt good in the group session was explanative for session outcome, while therapists’ perceptions and context conditions (supervision, number of participants) was not. Patients, therapists and co-therapists have different perspectives on the same group therapy session. Patients’ perceptions are associated with session outcomes. A lower session outcome must not be associated with a poor technique performance of the therapist. Therapists should not only be aware of alliance building and correct technical performance, but they must also be aware of patients’ perceptions of the group process and outcome. Key learning aims The present research is the first evaluation of group session aspects and session outcomes in rehabilitation patients with work anxieties in slow-open groups. We will learn: (1) Whether patients’, therapists’ and co-therapists’ perceptions of the same group session are similar or different; (2) Whether group sessions that result in worse outcomes are different from group sessions resulting in a better outcome; (3) Which aspects of the group session are predictive for a better outcome.",2020,,The Cognitive Behaviour Therapist,13,,,,10.1017/s1754470x20000124,,#2386,Muschalla 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Patients completed the Unwanted Events in Group Therapy Scale (UE-G scale).In the work-coping group, 41.9% of the patients reported at least one relevant side effect, as compared to 28.9% in the recreational group. These included an increase in the perception of anxiety and work-problems, feelings of exposure to criticism and the development of negative views on group therapy as such.This is the first randomized, controlled, therapy study in anxiety patients to systematically investigate side effects. Work-coping group interventions have, despite their useful main effects, specific negative effects, when compared with group encounters. Group psychotherapists or group moderators should be aware of the potential side effects in anxiety patients.",2020,,Psychiatria Danubina,32,1,115-121,,10.24869/psyd.2020.115,,#2389,Muschalla 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,JD
Mental work ability: young professionals with mental health problems perceive lower levels of soft skills,"Muschalla, Beate; Kutzner, Isabel","Abstract This article published in Gruppe Interaktion Organisation (GIO) reports study results on soft skills and mental work ability in young professionals ready to enter the job market. The so-called soft skills (psychological capacities) are nowadays an entrance ticket into the modern working world. Thus, the question is to which degree young professionals who will soon enter the labor market are fit in their soft skills. Are physical or mental health problems related with deficits in soft skills? Which dimensions of soft skills are impaired? 365 young professionals in advanced education from a technical college, who will soon enter the labor market, were investigated via online-questionnaire. Participants were asked to rate their self-perceived capacity level according to Mini-ICF-APP, mental and physical health problems, exam and education-related anxiety, self-efficacy and procrastination. Students with mental health problems had higher exam anxiety, and lower study-related self-efficacy as compared to students without health problems at all, or students with physical health problems. But, procrastination behavior was similarly present among students with mental health problems and students with physical health problems. Students with health problems did not report globally weaker capacity levels. Lower levels of capacities depend on the type of health problem: In students with mental health problems, social soft skills were impaired rather than content-related capacities. Physical health problems do not affect the self-perceived psychological capacities. In conclusion, focusing on specific soft skills in training and work adjustment could be fruitful in addition (or as an alternative) to training of profession-specific expertise.",2021,,Gruppe.

Specific event-related data presentation changes embitterment affect - an experimental study,"Muschalla, Beate; Monne, Emilia","Background: During the corona pandemic increased rates of embitterment have been found in the general population. As embitterment occurs reactive to triggers related to experienced negative events, and as people were steadily exposed to pandemic-related information, the research question arises: Can embitterment be triggered by pandemic-related information in form of infection rates displayed in figures? Method: Within an experimental design we investigated whether a figure presenting infection rates in an aggravated manner (seemingly strong infection increase and then stable course, experimental group, EG, n=138) leads to stronger embitterment increase, as compared to a figure presenting infection rates seemingly stable (control group, CG, n=155). Accompanying characteristics with potential influence on embitterment have been assessed: wisdom, general belief in a just world, perceived injustice events during the pandemic. Results: In contrast to the experimental hypothesis, the EG decreased in embitterment after reading the aggravated infection rates figure, whereas the CG rested stable. People with higher wisdom scores had a lower embitterment level after watching the infection data. There was no association between perceived pandemic-related injustice events and embitterment after watching the infection data. Belief in a just world slightly decreased over the course in both groups. Discussion: By means of pandemic-related data presentation, embitterment affect can be changed. Contradictory to expectation, the aggravated presentation led to a reduction of embitterment. This example shows that even simple but specific information presentations can induce changes in state affect, and this happens independently from other relevant characteristics (such as perceived injustice events during pandemic, or general belief in a just world). Professionals who present event-related data in public should explain these data and be aware that information and data presentation may relevantly impact on peoples affects.",2022,,Medical Research Archives,10,3,,,10.18103/mra.v10i3.2701,,#2392,Muschalla 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Capacities rather than psychopathology or information explain how high school finishers are attracted by academic studies,"Muschalla, Beate; Weimann, Margó","The number of academic students has risen. But, there are differences between academic studies and vocational training. The fit of one´s capacities to the demands is important for education success.

Prediction of Therapeutic Outcome in a Naturalistic Setting Using Pretreatment Psychological Distress Indicators,"Mütze, Kaline; Witthöft, Michael; Bräscher, Anne-Kathrin","Background: Outcome predictions allow to improve psychotherapy and to increase economic benefit. The efficient translation into practice requires simple prediction methods. The present study evaluates the prediction of treatment outcome based on initial distress level. Methods: Routine data of a university psychotherapy outpatient clinic were used (N = 3,145, Mage = 35.8, 67% female). Low versus high distress patients (classified by overall psychological distress, symptomatology, and previous treatment) were compared on total reduction in psychopathology, (early) response, remission, and premature treatment discontinuation using t tests and logistic regressions. Response and remission were assessed via relative (percentage improvement) and absolute measures (Reliable Change Index; RCI). Results: Distress level was inversely related to percentage improvement (OR = 0.62) and remission (OR = 0.34). It was positively related to total reduction in psychopathology (d = 0.63), RCI response (OR = 2.37), and treatment discontinuation (OR = 2.15). Early response and treatment discontinuation partially mediated the relationship between distress level and treatment outcome. Conclusions: Treatment success tends to be lower when initial distress is high, but this finding appears contingent on the operationalization of treatment outcome. The presented classification approach is easy to implement in practice and may be useful in order to counter an excessive workload in psychotherapy trainees.",2020,,Verhaltenstherapie,,,1-9,,10.1159/000510272,,#2394,Mütze 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The effects of a self-esteem manipulation on body dissatisfaction in binge eating disorder,"Naumann, Eva; Tuschen-Caffier, Brunna; Trentowska, Monika; Caffier, Detlef; Svaldi, Jennifer","Current cognitive-behavioral models on the etiology of eating disorders propose low self-esteem to be causally linked with body image disturbances. Thus, the aim of the present study was to experimentally test the influence of state self-esteem on actual body dissatisfaction in binge eating disorder (BED). Twenty-six women with BED were assigned to either a positive or negative implicit manipulation of self-esteem. Thereafter, participants' actual body dissatisfaction and emotions were measured prior to and after a one minute mirror exposure. Main results reveal that after the negative compared to the positive self-esteem manipulation body dissatisfaction was significantly lower both prior to and after the mirror exposure. By contrast, no effects of the self-esteem manipulation were found on emotional ratings. In line with predictions by current cognitive-behavioral models, the results yield some evidence of the deteriorating effects of low self-esteem on body dissatisfaction in BED.",2015,,Journal of Experimental Psychopathology,6,1,28-39,,10.5127/jep.040213,,#2395,Naumann 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Trait Worry and Neural Correlates of Emotion 					Regulation,"Neudert, Marie Kristin; Stark, Rudolf; Kress, Laura; Hermann, Andrea","Abstract. Pathological worrying is of high transdiagnostic relevance and is related to maladaptive emotion regulation processes. Dysfunctional emotion regulation and its underlying neural mechanisms might contribute to the maintenance of fear over time. Therefore, this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aims at investigating the association of trait worry with neural correlates of emotion regulation. Twenty-six healthy females were instructed to passively look at aversive pictures, to distract themselves with a neutral thought, or to down- and up-regulate negative feelings via cognitive reappraisal in response to repeatedly presented aversive pictures. Trait worry was not related to cognitive reappraisal but to distraction, which leads to a greater reduction of self-reported negative feelings and insula activation in individuals with higher trait worry. The current study indicates that the neural mechanisms underlying distraction seem to be altered in pathological worrying and may prevent adaptive emotional processing of aversive stimuli leading to the maintenance of fear.",2017,,Zeitschrift für Psychologie,225,3,214-222,,10.1027/2151-2604/a000305,,#2397,Neudert 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Impact of perceived social support on pain perception in virtual reality,"Neumann, Isabel; Käthner, Ivo; Gromer, Daniel; Pauli, Paul","Social influences are important modulators of pain. Experimental studies demonstrated analgesic effects of explicit social support. As digital health care gains importance, this study investigated influences of social support by virtual characters and their perceived agency in virtual reality on pain. In a within-subjects design, participants experienced painful heat stimuli in VR. Either a virtual character provided verbal support prior to the pain stimuli or not (support vs. no support condition). In addition, participants were instructed that a real human (avatar condition) or a computer script (virtual agent) controlled the virtual character. However, in both conditions, the virtual character was computer-controlled. Main outcome measures were pain ratings and physiological pain responses. Virtual verbal support affected physiological responses in terms of “stress buffering”, but not pain ratings. The agency manipulation was successful as the avatar yielded higher ratings of perceived human-likeness, helpfulness and realism compared to the virtual agent. However, agency of the character did not affect pain responses. This study revealed that virtual verbal support positively influences physiological pain responses independently of perceived agency. The findings have important clinical implications as virtual interactions and digital health interventions are increasingly relevant for pain treatment. • Participants felt more present in the virtual world with a virtual character. • Social support by a virtual character buffered physiological reactions. • Pain ratings were not affected by social support provided of virtual characters. • The perceived agency of the virtual character did not affect pain responses.",2023,,Computers in Human Behavior,139,,107490,,10.1016/j.chb.2022.107490,,#2398,Neumann 2023,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Responsibility, metacognition and unrealistic pessimism in obsessive–compulsive disorder","Niemeyer, Helen; Moritz, Steffen; Pietrowsky, Reinhard","Abstract Cognitive models stress the importance of cognitive belief domains (CBD) for the pathogenesis of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the relative contribution of responsibility and metacognition – core aspects of CBD – to OC symptoms is not fully understood yet. Furthermore, two subcomponents of overestimation of threat (OET), overestimation of the personal probability (unrealistic pessimism) and overestimation of the general risk of negative events, require clarification. First, we investigated the relative contribution of responsibility and metacognition to OC symptoms. Second, we hypothesized that OCD patients overestimate the personal risk and display unrealistic pessimism. Thirty-four OCD patients and 34 healthy controls completed the Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ) and the Unrealistic Optimism Questionnaire (UO). Responsibility significantly predicted obsessive symptoms after controlling for metacognition. In contrast to previous findings, responsibility is not fully explained by metacognition. Finally, our results confirm unrealistic pessimism in OCD, even after controlling for depression.",2013,,Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders,2,2,119-129,,10.1016/j.jocrd.2013.01.001,,#2400,Niemeyer 2013,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Visual search through displays of data,"Nothelfer, Christine; Franconeri, Steven","With the increasing availability and importance of data, the human visual system serves as a critical tool for analysis of patterns, trends, and relations among those data. Building on recent translational visual search work in domains like baggage screening (e.g., Mitroff et al., 2015) and radiology (e.g., Wolfe, 2016), we explored how different ways of representing data values can lead to efficient or inefficient visual processing of the relations between the values in a data pair. We asked participants to find a particular relation among the opposite relation (e.g., small/large value pairs among large/small), under a variety of common, and manipulated, data encoding methods: bullet graphs (one value as a bar, the other as a threshold dash through the bar), line graphs, connected dash graphs, area graphs, dash graphs (lines placed where the tops of bars in a bar graphs 'would be'), adjacent bars, and separated bars. Displays were divided into quadrants containing 1-5 data pairs each, for a total set size of 4-20 items. Participants were asked to quickly indicate which quadrant contained the target data pair. The choice of data depiction led to enormous differences in processing efficiency for relations between values (ranked fast to slow in the order listed above), from flat search slopes (line graphs), medium search slopes of 69 ms/pair (dash graphs), and severely steep search slopes of 115 ms/pair (separated bar graphs), one of the most ubiquitous encoding types. Visual search for relations can be strikingly serial, but performance can improve substantially with small changes to displays. Exploring visual search and relation processing in the context of data visualization displays may provide a rich case study for both basic research on the mechanisms of search, but also concrete guidelines for the students and scientists who use vision to process and convey patterns in data.

Hemifield-specific resources for controlling apparent motion,"Nothelfer, Christine; Suzuki, Satoru; Franconeri, Steven","The visual hemifields contain processing resources that are substantially independent across a handful of tasks, such as object tracking and extraction of visual statistics. We add a new task to this category - the ability to control ambiguous apparent motion. Participants viewed two simultaneous and identical dot quartet animations (300ms/frame) where each could be perceived as undergoing either vertical or horizontal motion. The default percept of such dual animations is to see both quartets move in the same manner, and careful mental control is needed to perceive them as moving differently. Each trial began with a cue for mental control: see this quartet moving vertically, and that quartet moving horizontally. The dependent measure was the amount of proximity-based 'help' (making dots closer either vertically or horizontally) that a participant needed to add using the method of adjustment, before they were confident that they could robustly perceive the cued motion pattern differently across the two quartets. This threshold level of needed help was lower when the quartets straddled the hemifield boundary in the lower visual field (mean aspect ratio of 1:1.2), compared to when the quartets were contained entirely within the left or right quadrant of the lower visual field (mean aspect ratio of 1:1.3), p< 0.05 with eccentricity controlled between conditions. We speculate that the separate resources that underlie this benefit for apparent motion share roots with the resources that bring hemifield benefits for object tracking tasks - more efficient deployment of multiple attentional 'spotlights' across the hemifield boundary.

Emotion-Regulation in Psychosis: Patients with Psychotic Disorders Apply Reappraisal Successfully,"Opoka, Sandra M.; Sundag, Johanna; Riehle, Marcel; Lincoln, Tania M.","Abstract Background Emotion-regulation is assumed to be impaired in psychosis: patients with psychotic disorders (PD) self-report to use reappraisal less frequently than healthy controls (HC), but it is uncertain whether they are also less successful in applying reappraisal. Moreover, it has not been investigated whether the habitual use of reappraisal is associated with the ability to use reappraisal successfully. Methods To address these questions, PD ( n = 60), a clinical control group of patients with anxiety disorders (AD; n = 40) and HC ( n = 40) completed questionnaires on habitual emotion-regulation and alexithymia, performed tests on neurocognitive functioning and jumping-to-conclusion bias, and were subjected to an emotion-regulation paradigm, in which they were asked to down-regulate induced anxiety and sadness. Results No differences were found between PD and HC regarding the habitual use of reappraisal, but PD reported to use reappraisal more frequently than AD. All groups were able to down-regulate anxiety and sadness via reappraisal following instructions. The habitual use of reappraisal and the reduction of anxiety and sadness after instruction were uncorrelated. Conclusion These findings question the common assumption that PD use reappraisal less often or less successfully. At least under laboratory condition, PD do not appear to be impaired in reducing negative affect via reappraisal successfully.",2020,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,45,1,31-45,,10.1007/s10608-020-10163-8,,#2404,Opoka 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Self-regulation is negatively associated with habit tendencies: A validation of the German Creature of Habit Scale,"Overmeyer, Rebecca; Fürtjes, Sophia; Ersche, Karen D.; Ehrlich, Stefan; Endrass, Tanja","Abstract Adaptive behavior depends on the process of self-regulation. If self-regulation fails, maladaptive behavior may start to predominate, leading to impulsive actions, maladaptive habits, and compulsive behavior patterns. The tendency to develop habitual behavior differs between individuals and appears to be associated with different aspects of regulatory control. The present study examined associations of habitual propensity with self-regulation, impulsivity, and compulsivity, elucidating possible underlying functional connections and evaluated the psychometric properties of a German version of the Creature of Habit Scale (COHS). Data of two independent community samples was collected online. Dynamic connections with measures of regulatory control, namely self-regulation, impulsivity, and compulsivity, were analyzed using a network approach. Psychometric analyses were conducted using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses utilizing a Bayesian lasso procedure. Network analysis revealed that self-regulation was the most central node within the network of dynamic interactions between habitual propensity, impulsivity, and compulsivity. Self-regulation exclusively had negative associations with other measures. We replicated and validated the two-factorial structure of the COHS. Our findings provide evidence that habitual propensity is interconnected with measures of regulatory control. Information gathered using the COHS could be useful in identifying vulnerabilities and developing tailored therapeutic strategies for psychopathologies associated with deficient regulatory control.",2020,,Personality and Individual Differences,163,,110029,,10.1016/j.paid.2020.110029,,#2405,Overmeyer 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Social Presence as a Moderator of the Effect of Agent Behavior on Emotional Experience in Social Interactions in Virtual Reality,"Pfaller, Michael; Kroczek, Leon O. H.; Lange, Bastian; Fülöp, Raymund; Müller, Mathias; Mühlberger, Andreas","Background: Exposure therapy involves exposure to feared stimuli and is considered to be the gold-standard treatment for anxiety disorders. While its application in Virtual Reality (VR) has been very successful for phobic disorders, the effects of exposure to virtual social stimuli in Social Anxiety Disorder are heterogeneous. This difference has been linked to demands on realism and presence, particularly social presence, as a pre-requisite in evoking emotional experiences in virtual social interactions. So far, however, the influence of social presence on emotional experience in social interactions with virtual agents remains unknown. Objective: We investigated the relationship between realism and social presence and the moderating effect of social presence on the relationship between agent behavior and experienced emotions in virtual social interaction. Methods: Healthy participants ( N = 51) faced virtual agents showing supportive and dismissive behaviors in two virtual environments (short interactions and oral presentations). At first, participants performed five blocks of short one-on-one interactions with virtual agents (two male and two female agents per block). Secondly, participants gave five presentations in front of an audience of 16 agents. In each scenario, agent behavior was a within subjects factor, resulting in one block of neutral, two blocks of negative, and two blocks of positive agent behavior. Ratings of agent behavior (valence and realism), experience (valence and arousal), and presence (physical and social) were collected after every block. Moderator effects were investigated using mixed linear models with random intercepts. Correlations were analyzed via repeated measures correlations. Results: Ratings of valence of agent behaviors showed reliable relationships with experienced valence and less reliable relationships with experienced arousal. These relationships were moderated by social presence in the presentation scenario. Results for the interaction scenario were weaker but potentially promising for experimental studies. Variations in social presence and realism over time were correlated but social presence proved a more reliable moderator. Conclusion: Our findings emphasize the role of social presence for emotional experience in response to specific agent behaviors in virtual social interactions. While these findings should be replicated with experimental designs and in clinical samples, variability in social presence might account for heterogeneity in efficacy of virtual exposure to treat social anxiety disorder.",2021,,Frontiers in Virtual Reality,2,,,,10.3389/frvir.2021.741138,,#2409,Pfaller 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Barriers to Seeking Psychotherapy for Mental Health Problems in Adolescents: a mixed method study,"Pfeiffer, Simone; In-Albon, Tina","Abstract Given the large discrepancy between prevalence rates of mental disorders in adolescents and actual treatment rates, there is a need to understand what prevents this age group from seeking psychotherapy. We assessed the barriers to seeking psychotherapy in this age group, including their attitudes toward people with a mental disorder, using a convergent parallel mixed-methods design. Participants were 288 adolescents aged 12–21 years ( M = 16.8 years, SD = 2.3; 37% identified as male, 63% as female, and 0% as nonbinary). Qualitative data were obtained with open-ended questions on barriers to initiating psychotherapy and attitudes toward people with a mental disorder. Barriers to seeking psychotherapy and information about psychotherapy were assessed with a questionnaire using a quantitative design. The qualitative assessment revealed as the main barriers fear of a negative interaction with a psychotherapist, fear of being confronted with their own emotions, self-stigma, and fear of public stigma. Further, lack of accessibility, lack of trust in the therapist, a desire for social distance from, and a negative attitude toward people with a mental disorder were associated with a decreased intention to initiate psychotherapy. Previous positive experience with a psychotherapist was a facilitator of seeking psychotherapy. We found gender differences, with higher desire for social distance and higher optimism bias scores as well as poorer mental health knowledge for participants identifying as male. Integrating results from both approaches results in further information for the improvement of prevention programs and interventions to lower barriers to seeking psychotherapy. Gender differences indicate a need for gender-role-specific interventions.",2022,,Journal of Child and Family Studies,31,9,2571-2581,,10.1007/s10826-022-02364-4,,#2413,Pfeiffer 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

In this study, we examined the violation and change of threat beliefs during exposure. From 8,484 standardized exposure records of 605 patients with different anxiety disorders, learning indicators were derived: expectancy violation as mismatch between threat expectancy before exposure and threat occurrence, expectancy change as difference between original and adjusted expectancy after exposure, and prediction-error learning rate as extent to which expectancy violation transferred into change. Throughout sessions, high threat expectancy but low occurrence and adjusted expectancy indicated successful violation and change of threat beliefs by exposure. Expectancy violation, change, and learning rate substantially varied between patients. Not expectancy violation itself, but higher learning rate and expectancy change predicted better treatment outcome.

Smart-Glass Guided Exposure for Anxiety Disorders: A Proof-of-Concept Study,"Pittig, Andre; Hoyer, Jürgen; Noack, René","• Practicability barriers hinder dissemination of exposure. • Smartglass devices may enable therapists to guide exposure from their own office. • Smartglass-guided exposure was positively evaluated, adverse events were minimal. • Smartglass-guided exposure resulted in strong within-session fear reduction. Exposure is a highly effective treatment for pathological fear and anxiety, but rarely used in routine care. Issues of practicability and lack of therapists in rural areas are main barriers for the dissemination of exposure. Smartglass devices may enable therapists to guide exposure from their own office via real-time feedback and may thereby increase practicability. The present study explored the technological usability and clinical feasibility of Smartglass-guided exposure in a behavioral approach test in spider-fearful individuals ( N = 40). Fearful individuals were asked to start the Smartglass themselves and established a connection to a therapist, who guided the exposure test from afar. Clinical severity of spider fear was assessed via questionnaire. Technological usability was assessed with established measures of usability, user experience, and user acceptance. Exploratory, individual characteristics of exposure were collected (e.g., within-session fear reduction, duration, safety behavior). Overall, fearful individuals (94.9%) and therapists (100%) were able to establish a connection. Usability of Smartglass-guided exposure was evaluated as positive. Within-session fear reduction was large ( d = 1.91). Adverse events were minimal. There were, however, some associations between exposure characteristics and usability evaluation (e.g., lower user-friendliness and exposure duration). Two case examples further highlight chances and risks of Smartglass-guided exposure. These findings provide first evidence that Smartglass-guided exposure could be useful in exposure therapy. Smartglass-guided exposure may ultimately help to increase practicability of exposure and increase dissemination, also in rural areas. These findings are promising for future research on the long-term outcome of evidence-based exposure in treatment seeking patients.",2021,,Cognitive and Behavioral Practice,28,3,364-378,,10.1016/j.cbpra.2020.12.003,,#2417,Pittig 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Reducing the return of avoidance and fear by directly targeting avoidance: Comparing incentive-based and instructed extinction of avoidance to passive fear extinction,"Pittig, Andre; Wong, Alex H. K.","Enhancing the reduction of avoidance may optimize treatment for anxiety disorders. Past research focused on boosting fear extinction to reduce avoidance, however, with limited success. Directly extinguishing avoidance may be more promising. This preregistered study tested the impact of incentives and instruction for non-avoidance compared to passive fear extinction on long-term avoidance and fear reduction. On Day 1, participants acquired conditioned fear and avoidance to a conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with an aversive outcome. Next, incentives or instructions encouraged non-avoidance to the CS, which was no longer reinforced by a US regardless of avoidance (Incentives and Instruction group). In a third group, avoidance was unavailable and the CS was passively presented in absence of the US (Passive Fear Extinction group). On Day 2, avoidance retention and reinstatement and return of fear were tested. In the short term, incentives and instruction strongly reduced avoidance with similar fear reduction compared to passive fear extinction. Importantly, incentives and instruction were linked to lower long-term avoidance retention. Avoidance reinstatement was evident in all groups, but avoidance remained higher after passive fear extinction. Finally, incentives yielded a lower return of threat expectancies. Thus, targeting avoidance instead of fear better reduced long-term avoidance and, for incentives, the return of fear. Especially, incentives could be a promising add-on to exposure.",2022,,Journal of Experimental Psychopathology,13,4,204380872211364,,10.1177/20438087221136424,,#2418,Pittig 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Afterwards, participants provided detailed information on perceived emotions and emotion regulation strategies in an ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Multilevel models were calculated. In consideration of valence, emotion intensity, arousal, intensity of body sensations and, emotion regulation success were modeled as a function of centered interoceptive accuracy.

Annoyance of residents induced by wind turbine obstruction lights: A cross-country comparison of impact factors,"Pohl, Johannes; Rudolph, David; Lyhne, Ivar; Clausen, Niels-Erik; Aaen, Sara Bjørn; Hübner, Gundula; Kørnøv, Lone; Kirkegaard, Julia K.","Larger wind turbines are developed to harvest greater amounts of wind energy. This development increases the dilemma between ensuring aviation safety through obstruction lights and reducing citizen annoyance and possible stress effects caused by obstruction lights. In this study, a unique Danish sample is contrasted with a combined German-Swiss sample. Stronger stress effects due to the lights for the Danish sample compared to the German-Swiss study were found, an issue that could be related to the specific technical and site conditions. The prevalence of strongly annoyed residents was low. Significant factors for predicting obstruction light annoyance stress were identified, including: perceived fairness, consideration of the interests of the community, landscape change annoyance stress, number of visible wind turbines and age. It is recommended to enhance the planning process to reduce the stress among citizens, e.g. through improved communication, and to enhance the participation of residents in a way that allows for a meaningful consideration of people's concerns. • Stress effects from obstruction lights at wind turbines are assessed. • Obstruction lights can induce strong stress effects under certain conditions. • Perceived fairness and stress during planning process are significant predictors. • Distance to wind turbines is not correlated with obstruction light annoyance stress.",2021,,Energy Policy,156,,112437,,10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112437,,#2422,Pohl 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

M120. Negative Functional Outcomes of Diminished Emotional Expression in Schizophrenia: The Case of Smiling in Face-To-Face Interactions,"Riehle, Marcel; Mehl, Stephanie; Lincoln, Tania Marie","Abstract Background: Diminished facial expressiveness is a consistent finding in schizophrenia, which appears to be most pronounced for positive facial expressions (ie, smiling). As an affiliative signal, smiling has the potential to be a behavioral marker of negative symptoms and could be associated with functional outcomes. However, most studies investigated facial expressions in people with schizophrenia in nonaffiliative contexts and rarely in face-to-face interactions. Furthermore, only few studies have looked at the social consequences of reduced facial expressiveness. We hypothesized that people with schizophrenia in an affiliative face-to-face interaction (1) would display less smiling than controls and that (2) low-expressive patients compared to high-expressive patients would exhibit more negative symptoms, lower social competence, and receive more negative social evaluations. Methods: The sample consisted of 52 patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and 39 healthy controls. All participants engaged in an affiliative role play with a study confederate. Independent sets of raters then coded these interactions for the amount of smiling (using the Facial Expression Coding System [FACES; Kring & Sloan, 2007]), social competence, and desire for future interactions with the participant. Moreover, in the patient sample, we assessed psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and social role functioning with structured interviews. We performed a median split within the patient sample, distinguishing low- and high-expressive patients with respect to amount of smiling and tested for differences between the resulting groups on all dependent measures. We also tested for differences between the 2 patient groups and controls, where measures were available. Results: Compared to controls, participants with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder exhibited significantly lower levels of smiling (d = −0.56), significantly lower social competence (d = −0.68), and were evaluated as less desirable for future interactions (d = −0.58). However, only participants in the low but not in the high-expressive patient group differed from controls on these 3 variables. Low-expressive patients differed from high-expressive patients with respect to negative symptoms (d = 0.72), social functioning (d = −0.63), social competence (d = −0.66), and desire for future interactions (d = −0.80). No differences between the 2 patient groups were found on other symptom dimensions (eg, positive, disorganized, depression), any sample characteristics, and medication dose. Conclusion: Our findings corroborate emerging evidence suggesting that diminished smiling behavior in schizophrenia is a behavioral substrate of negative symptoms in face-to-face interactions and indicative of negative functional outcomes. Our results highlight the need for developing treatments that foster affiliative interaction skills in schizophrenia.",2017,,Schizophrenia Bulletin,43,suppl_1,S254-S254,,10.1093/schbul/sbx022.114,,#2429,Riehle 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Time Course of Error-Potentiated Startle and its Relationship to Error-Related Brain Activity,"Riesel, Anja; Weinberg, Anna; Moran, Tim; Hajcak, Greg","Errors are aversive, motivationally-salient events which prime defensive action. This is reflected in a potentiated startle reflex after the commission of an error. The current study replicates and extends previous work examining the time course of error-potentiated startle as a function of startle lag (i.e., 300 ms or 800 ms following correct and error responses). In addition, the relationship between error-potentiated startle and error-related brain activity in both the temporal (error-related negativity, ERN/Ne) and spectral (error-related theta and delta power) domains was investigated. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 32 healthy undergraduates while they performed an arrowhead version of a flanker task. Complex Morlet wavelets were applied to compute oscillatory power in the delta- and theta-band range. Consistent with our previous report, startle was larger following errors. Furthermore, this effect was evident at both early and late startle probe times. Increased delta and theta power after an error was associated with larger error-potentiated startle. An association between ERN amplitude and error-potentiated startle was only observed in a subgroup of individuals with relatively large ERN/Ne amplitude. Among these individuals, ERN/Ne magnitude was also related to multiple indices of task performance. This study further supports the notion that errors are aversive events that prime defensive motivation, and that error-potentiated startle is evident beyond the immediate commission of an error and can be predicted from error-related brain activity.",2013,,Journal of Psychophysiology,27,2,51-59,,10.1027/0269-8803/a000093,,#2431,Riesel 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Rejection sensitivity as a mediator of the relationship between experienced rejection and borderline characteristics,"Rosenbach, Charlotte; Renneberg, Babette","• Experienced rejection, rejection sensitivity and borderline traits were examined. • Rejection sensitivity mediated the relation between rejection and borderline traits. • Social support was identified as additional significant mediator. • We hypothesize rejection sensitivity to be a crucial factor in the etiology of BPD. Experiences of rejection in childhood play an important role in the etiology of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Additionally, individuals who report borderline symptoms report high levels of rejection sensitivity. The current study aimed to disentangle the relationship between experiences of rejection, rejection sensitivity and borderline characteristics. Therefore, we retrospectively assessed experiences of parental and peer rejection, collected data of self-reported rejection sensitivity and social support and prospectively investigated borderline characteristics in a sample of 193 students. Results indicated that rejection sensitivity fully mediated the previously significant relationship between experiences of parental rejection and borderline characteristics, whereas peer rejection maintained a significant effect on borderline traits.

The English Children’s Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (CRSQ) was translated, adapted, and presented to a non-clinical sample (N = 128) (Study I) to identify psychometric properties of the instrument. In Study II, the resulting questionnaire was completed by a mixed clinical sample (N = 50).

In five studies, we evaluated the psychometric properties of a revised German version of the State Self-Esteem Scale (SSES; Heatherton &amp; Polivy, 1991 ). In Study 1, the results of a confirmatory factor analysis on the original scale revealed poor model fit and poor construct validity in a student sample that resembled those in the literature; thus, a revised 15-item version was developed (i.e., the SSES-R) and thoroughly validated. Study 2 showed a valid three-factor structure (Performance, Social, and Appearance) and good internal consistency of the SSES-R. Correlations between subscales of trait and state SE empirically supported the scale’s construct validity. Temporal stability and intrapersonal sensitivity of the scale to naturally occurring events were investigated in Study 3. Intrapersonal sensitivity of the scale to experimentally induced changes in state SE was uncovered in Study 4 via social feedback (acceptance vs. rejection) and performance feedback (positive vs. negative). In Study 5, the scale’s interpersonal sensitivity was confirmed by comparing depressed and healthy individuals. Finally, the usefulness of the SSES-R was demonstrated by assessing SE instability as calculated from repeated measures of state SE.",2020,,European Journal of Psychological Assessment,36,1,196-206,,10.1027/1015-5759/a000501,,#2436,Rudolph 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Stress immunization? Hair cortisol predicts blunted reactivity to an acute stressor,"Sandner, Magdalena Eva; Lois, Giannis; Zeier, Peter; Wessa, Michèle","22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disorder associated with neurodevelopmental, anxiety and mood disorders, as well as an increased risk for developing psychosis. Cortisol levels and stress reactivity reflect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis activity, and are believed to be altered in individuals that often experience daily-life stress, depression, and psychotic symptoms. However, it is unknown whether individuals with 22q11DS display an altered stress reactivity.We included 27 adults with 22q11DS (mean age: 34.1 years, 67% female) and 24 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC; mean age: 39.9 years, 71% female) into an experience sampling study. Throughout 6 consecutive days, we measured participants’ subjective stress related to current activity and at the same time collected salivary cortisol samples. Multilevel regression models were used to analyze cortisol reactivity to activity-related stress.Diurnal cortisol levels were significantly lower in the 22q11DS group compared to HCs (B=-1.03, p < 0.001). 22q11DS adults displayed significantly attenuated cortisol reactivity to activity-related stress compared to HCs (B = −0.04, p = 0.026). Post-hoc exploratory analysis revealed that these results were independent from 22q11DS psychiatric diagnosis or medication use.These results indicate that adults with 22q11DS have lower cortisol levels and attenuated cortisol response to daily stress, possibly resulting from an increased sensitization of the HPA-axis. This suggests that alterations in HPA-axis functioning, previously reported in several psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychotic disorder, and mood disorder, also appear to be present in adults with 22q11DS.",2019,,Psychoneuroendocrinology,100,,S6,,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.12.037,,#2441,Sandner 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Inhibitory Learning-Based Exposure Therapy for Patients With Pathological Health Anxiety: Results From a Single Case Series Study,"Sauer, Karoline S.; Bailer, Josef; Jungmann, Stefanie M.; Witthöft, Michael","Exposure to illness-related stimuli is a crucial component of CBT for pathological health anxiety. Modern exposure approaches focus on forming inhibitory associations and provide promising results. An implementation in the treatment of pathological health anxiety is still missing. The present single case series study investigated the applicability and effects of an inhibitory learning-based exposure approach (12 sessions) on health anxiety, safety behavior, and tolerance for aversive states in n = 7 outpatients (age: M = 35.14, SD = 8.43) with a DSM-5 Illness Anxiety Disorder or Somatic Symptom Disorder with predominant health worries in multilevel models.

Inhibitory Learning versus Habituation in an Experimental Exposure Intervention for People With Heightened Health Anxiety: Increase of Distress Tolerance as a Joint Mechanism of Change?,"Sauer, Karoline S.; Witthöft, Michael","The Inhibitory Learning Theory (ILT; Craske et al., 2008) changed the focus of exposure-based treatment from erasing excitatory associations and fear reduction (habituation (HA)) to reinforcing inhibitory associations and fear toleration (inhibitory learning (IL)). Studies which directly compare both approaches, IL versus HA, are scarce. The present study aimed at implementing and comparing an IL-based ( n = 26; Age: M = 23.59, SD = 4.38) with a HA-based ( n = 28; Age: M = 25.46, SD = 6.22) experimental exposure approach (including in vivo, interoceptive, and in sensu exposure) in a sample of people with heightened health anxiety. A significant pre- to post-intervention reduction of state health anxiety ( p &lt; .001), which was especially associated with an increase of distress tolerance (DT) pre- to post-exposure ( F (1, 50) = 12.2, p &lt; .001, η p 2 = .20), was observed. A superiority of the IL-based over the HA-based exposure intervention was not detected in relation to major outcomes (e.g., state health anxiety), as well as in relation to a change of DT.

The current study examined associations between factors on different ecological levels (individual, family, community) and inhibitory control (IC), working memory (WM), cognitive flexibility (CF), and selective attention (SA) among 226 Burundian youth aged between 7 and 15 in three refugee camps. Multiple regression models revealed positive associations between trauma exposure and CF and between posttraumatic stress symptoms and SA and WM. Having more siblings, fathers' socioeconomic status and a better father-child relationship were related to better EF including higher SA and WM. Higher levels of maltreatment by mothers were related to lower IC. Higher peer support was related to higher WM. Being orphaned, children's emotional and behavioral problems, mothers' education, community violence and the type of camp (established vs. new) were not significantly related to children's EF. The findings underscore the importance of proximal social factors for children's EF. • Fathers` socioeconomic status and father-child relationship quality were positively related to youth's executive skills. • Having more siblings and supportive friends was related to higher working memory. • Maltreatment by mothers was associated with lower inhibitory control. • Interventions promoting socioeconomic conditions and father involvement may foster refugee youth's executive functioning.",2022,,Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology,80,,101399,,10.1016/j.appdev.2022.101399,,#2444,Scharpf 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Telephone Support in an Internet-Based Treatment for Sleep Problems in Early Childhood,"Schlarb, Angelika A; Brandhorst, Isabel; Peters, Elisabeth; Hautzinger, Martin","Study background: Mild to severe sleep problems are reported in 3% to 56% of young children. Behaviourbased treatments are highly effective in improving children´s sleep. The purpose of this work was to examine the efficacy of an Internet-based intervention for young children´s sleep disturbances (Mini-KiSS Online) and to assess the effect of telephone support for parents.Methods: Two intervention conditions (written information with or without additional weekly telephone support) were compared to a waiting-list control condition. N=199 parents with their children (aged 6-63 months) were randomly assigned to one of the study conditions. The treatment consisted of six written information modules based on a cognitive-behavioural approach. One of the treatment groups had additional weekly telephone support. Data of sleep diary, parental behaviour, CBCL 1.5-5 (pre, post, 3-month follow-up) and treatment evaluation were collected.Results: Acceptance of Mini-KiSS Online was high. Children in both treatment conditions showed significant increase in sleep efficacy and reductions in sleep onset latency, duration of night waking, or subjective global ratings while there was no or less change in the control condition. Parents of both treatment conditions reduced their parental presence and physical contact to the child. A benefit of personal assistance was found for treatment evaluation and dropout rates.Conclusion: Mini-KiSS Online is an effective and highly accepted internet-based intervention to reduce sleep problems in young children.

In total, data of 630 adolescents and young adults (150 males, 480 females; aged 16 - 21) were analyzed in this study. Results: Infatuation did not relate to overall sleep quality and dreams. Sleep disturbances, as a component of overall sleep quality, were more frequent in infatuated adolescents. Adolescents currently suffering from lovesickness reported a significantly lower sleep quality, more negative dreams and nightmares. Furthermore, nightmares influenced them more strongly the next day.

Can Gender Differences in Distress Due to Difficult Voices Be Explained by Differences in Relating?,"Schlier, Björn; Sitara, Xenia; Strauss, Clara; Rammou, Aikaterini; Lincoln, Tania M.; Hayward, Mark","Abstract Background Research on gender differences has found that women relate to negative voice hearing experiences with more negative emotions and report more distress due to voices, which may be rooted in differences in relating to voices. This study used a robust methodology and a large sample to explore gender differences in relating to voices and voice distress. Methods Matched samples of male ( n = 124) and female ( n = 124) voice hearers were drawn from a survey for secondary analysis. Voice severity (e.g., frequency or loudness), voice distress, and different types of dysfunctional (i.e., passive or aggressive) and functional (assertive) relating were measured. Group comparisons, mediation models, and network analyses were calculated. Results Female voice hearers reported more severe voices, more voice distress, more passive, and less assertive relating. Mediation and network analyses yielded evidence for pathways from gender to voice distress via relating and via differences in voice severity. Conclusion Gender differences in the emotional impact of voices can be partially explained by relating behavior. Psychological interventions for voice hearing could be optimized by exploring the influence of gender in the emergence of distressing voices. Nevertheless, gender differences need to be treated as one of several different possible mechanisms when working with individual patients.",2021,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,45,4,831-839,,10.1007/s10608-020-10190-5,,#2454,Schlier 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Why are you so slow? – Misattribution of transmission delay to attributes of the conversation partner at the far-end,"Schoenenberg, Katrin; Raake, Alexander; Koeppe, Judith","Abstract This study addresses the question of how transmission delay affects user perception during speech communication over telephone systems. It aims to show that the occurrence of pure delay should not be neglected when planning a telephone or conferencing system even if no impact on the perceived quality of the call can be found. It is, for instance, known that, the communication surface structure changes dramatically when transmission delay is inserted by the communication system. Furthermore, studies suggest a change in the perception of the interlocutor at the far-end. This paper describes two experiments that assess the misattribution of the technical impairment delay to personality and behavior-related attributes of the conversation partners. The first experiment shows that interlocutors are perceived as being less attentive when conversing in a three-party setting with symmetrical and asymmetrical delay conditions. In the second experiment, the misattribution is considered in more detail looking at ascribed personality attributes in two-party interaction under transmission delay. For both experiments, comparing the conversation surface structure of delayed to non-delayed calls helped to understand the found outcomes.",2014,,International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,72,5,477-487,,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2014.02.004,,#2464,Schoenenberg 2014,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The Effect of Patient Progress Feedback on Psychotherapy Outcome,"Schöttke, Henning; Unrath, Michael; Uhlmann, Christina","&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There is evidence that outpatient psychotherapy is effective in treating mental disorders. However, 5–10% of the patients get worse during treatment. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Patients and Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This randomised, controlled trial investigates the effect of systematic feedback of patients’ progress to therapists on the outcome of psychotherapy. A total of 230 adult patients were randomly assigned to three conditions: progress monitoring with feedback, progress monitoring without feedback, no progress monitoring. Subsequently, they were treated with cognitive behavioral therapy in an outpatient clinic. Feedback was based on three self-report questionnaires: Questionnaire for the Evaluation of Psychotherapeutic Change (FEP-2), Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-30), and Assessment for Signal Cases (ASC). Variance analyses with repeated measurements were conducted to verify whether feedback enhances treatment outcomes. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There were no statistical differences between the three conditions with regard to sociodemographic and disease-relevant variables. Patients’ impairment improved significantly in all three groups, but there were no significant differences between groups. Moreover, feedback had no differential effect on patients without initial improvement (n = 49). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discussion and Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; In our study, collective patients’ progress feedback to therapists had neither a global nor a differential effect on treatment outcomes. In order to better demonstrate a potential feedback effect, future studies should aim for a higher frequency of feedback, measure therapists’ attitude towards such feedback systems, and use “clinical support tools.”",2019,,Verhaltenstherapie,,,1-11,,10.1159/000503765,,#2466,Schöttke 2019,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
"Cognitive and emotional empathy in typically developing children: The influence of age, gender, and intelligence","Schwenck, Christina; Göhle, Bettina; Hauf, Juliane; Warnke, Andreas; Freitag, Christine M.; Schneider, Wolfgang","In the current study, the influence of age, gender and IQ on cognitive and emotional empathy in school-aged children and adolescents was examined adopting two behavioural paradigms: participants were shown film clips with different scenes of social interaction to which they were asked to respond. Thus, 134 children aged seven to 17 years (mean age = 138.4 months, sd = 31.66 months) were tested for emotion recognition, perspective taking and emotional empathy. Age strongly influenced components of cognitive empathy and explained 33.5% to 39.1% of the variance. Gender and IQ also were significant predictors, yet only explained 3% to 5%, respectively 8% to 9% of the variance. In contrast, neither age, gender nor IQ were related to emotional empathy.

How to Change Negative Outcome Expectations in Psychotherapy? The Role of the Therapist’s Warmth and Competence,"Seewald, Anna; Rief, Winfried","Negative outcome expectations of psychological treatments predict unfavorable treatment outcomes. Therefore, therapists should approach negative outcome expectations and ideally transform them into more positive outcome expectations. In this study, we investigated the therapist’s interpersonal behavior to optimize the modification of negative outcome expectations. After inducing negative expectations in an online experiment, we presented different videos of therapist–patient interactions to violate the induced negative outcome expectations. We kept the expectation-violating information constant and manipulated the therapist’s warmth and competence. Results confirmed a significant influence of the therapist’s warmth and competence on expectation violation, which led to the most positive outcome expectations when the therapist was both warm and competent. In contrast to former correlational analyses, our experimental study confirms the causal role of the therapist’s interpersonal behavior and its impact on changing patients’ negative outcome expectations. On the basis of these findings, more powerful approaches to optimize critical outcome expectations can be developed.",2022,,Clinical Psychological Science,11,1,149-163,,10.1177/21677026221094331,,#2471,Seewald 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
"The interplay of interoceptive accuracy, facets of interoceptive sensibility, and trait anxiety: A network analysis","Slotta, Timo; Witthöft, Michael; Gerlach, Alexander L.; Pohl, Anna","Interoception is the sense of the body's physiological state. Both the ability to accurately perceive bodily signals, and the self-reported sensibility for the body were assumed to be reciprocally associated with negative affect. Up to now, the specific interplay between dimensions of interoception and negative affect remains largely unknown. We investigated the interplay of cardioceptive accuracy assessed by a heartbeat tracking task, facets of interoceptive sensibility as measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, and trait anxiety as measured by the trait version of the State-Trait-Anxiety inventory across two studies ( n = 243) using a network analytic approach. The resulting network structure suggested a relationship between interoceptive sensibility and trait anxiety through the tendency to evaluate one's own body as trustworthy. Interoceptive accuracy showed no considerable associations to other variables. The findings question the relevance of cardiac interoceptive accuracy for trait anxiety in healthy populations. • Associations of several interoceptive variables and trait anxiety (TA) were studied. • Central and marginal facets of interoceptive sensibility (IS) were identified. • IS and TA were negatively linked over the appraisal of the own body as trustworthy. • Cardioceptive accuracy showed no relevant associations with facets of IS or TA.",2021,,Personality and Individual Differences,183,,111133,,10.1016/j.paid.2021.111133,,#2473,Slotta 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

The Readiness to Reconcile Inventory,"Stammel, Nadine; Bockers, Estelle; Neuner, Frank; Chhim, Sotheara; Taing, Sopheap; Knaevelsrud, Christine","Abstract. Although awareness of the importance of reconciliation in post-conflict societies has grown in recent decades, validated measures assessing victims’ attitudes toward reconciliation are lacking. To fill this gap, the Readiness to Reconcile Inventory (RRI) was developed and its factor structure and aspects of construct validity were psychometrically tested in two independent samples of survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. Exploratory factor analysis in a sample of N = 247 survivors identified a 13-item, three-factor internal structure of the RRI that was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis in an independent sample of N = 830 survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime. All RRI subscales showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s αs from .80 to .83). Multiple-group analysis established configural, metric, and scalar invariance across sex. The RRI thus demonstrated good reliability and fulfilled some aspects of construct validity. It is a time-effective and easy-to-administer instrument for assessing readiness to reconcile in victims of war and conflict.",2017,,European Journal of Psychological Assessment,33,6,436-444,,10.1027/1015-5759/a000304,,#2477,Stammel 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Metta-Based Therapy for Chronic Depression: a Wait List Control Trial,"Stangier, Ulrich; Frick, Artjom; Thinnes, Isabel; Arens, Elisabeth A.; Hofmann, Stefan G.","Abstract Objectives Current treatments for chronic depression have focused on reducing interpersonal problems and negative affect, but paid little attention to promoting prosocial motivation and positive affect. Following this treatment focus, the objective of the present study was to examine whether the combination of metta (Loving Kindness) group meditation and subsequent tailored individual therapy focusing on kindness towards oneself and others (metta-based therapy, MBT) shows greater improvements in depressive symptoms than a wait list control group in patients with chronic depression. Methods Forty-eight patients with DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder were randomly assigned to MBT or a wait list control condition. Outcome was assessed after group meditation, after subsequent individual therapy, and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was an independent blind rating of depressive symptoms at post-test. Secondary outcome included changes in self-reported depression, behavioral activation, rumination, social functioning, mindfulness, compassion, and clinician-rated emotion regulation. Results Mixed-design analyses showed significant differences between MBT and WLC in changes from pre- to post-test in clinician-rated and self-rated depression, behavioral activation, rumination, social functioning, mindfulness, and emotion regulation. Most of the changes occurred during group meditation and were associated with large effect sizes. Improvements were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions The results provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of MBT in treating chronic depression.

Is a High Association Between Repetitive Negative Thinking and Negative Affect Predictive of Depressive Symptoms? A Clustering Approach for Experience-Sampling Data,"Stefanovic, Mina; Rosenkranz, Tabea; Ehring, Thomas; Watkins, Edward R.; Takano, Keisuke","A reciprocal relationship between repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and negative affect (NA) has been found in various types of psychopathology. Recent studies have suggested that the magnitude of this association can vary across time and individuals, which may inform future psychopathology. Here, we explored how these dynamics and interplays are manifested in student and general populations using a statistical clustering algorithm. Across three experience-sampling data sets, our clustering analyses consistently identified two groups of individuals; one group had a higher bidirectional association between RNT and NA (and also higher inertia) than the other group. Furthermore, a prospective analysis revealed that the group with the higher bidirectional association is at risk of developing depressive symptoms during the 3-month follow-up period if they had experienced high levels of NA over the experience-sampling phase. These findings suggest that the dysfunctional affective and cognitive dynamics would be a promising target of preventive intervention.",2021,,Clinical Psychological Science,10,1,74-89,,10.1177/21677026211009495,,#2480,Stefanovic 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Multidimensional perfectionism and the ICD-11 personality disorder model,"Stricker, Johannes; Flett, Gordon L.; Hewitt, Paul L.; Pietrowsky, Reinhard","The International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) contains a dimensional model of personality disorder. Beyond general personality dysfunction, this model accommodates six personality descriptors depicting maladaptive personality characteristics. Perfectionism is a well-researched multidimensional personality disposition with strong links to psychological maladjustment. Yet, it is unclear how multidimensional perfectionism is conceptually and empirically represented in the ICD-11. In this questionnaire study, we assessed relations between the ICD-11 personality disorder model and perfectionism traits. In two community samples ( N Sample 1 = 293, N Sample 2 = 308), all perfectionism traits, except other-oriented perfectionism, substantially correlated with the six ICD-11 personality descriptors and personality dysfunction. Additionally, two perfectionism traits displayed small incremental utility for explaining personality dysfunction beyond the ICD-11 personality descriptors. This study shows that perfectionism traits are related but not redundant to the ICD-11 personality descriptors. We discuss implications for the measurement and potential gradual refinement of the ICD-11 personality disorder model based on our findings and previous perfectionism research. • Investigated relations of perfectionism and the ICD-11 personality disorder model • Most perfectionism traits correlated with the six ICD-11 personality descriptors. • Most perfectionism traits correlated with personality dysfunction. • Two perfectionism traits displayed small incremental utility beyond the ICD-11 descriptors. • Perfectionism research may inform measurement and refinement of the ICD-11 model.",2022,,Personality and Individual Differences,188,,111455,,10.1016/j.paid.2021.111455,,#2484,Stricker 2022,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Other-oriented perfectionism in daily life situations: An experience sampling study,"Stricker, Johannes; Kritzler, Sarah; Buecker, Susanne","Abstract How do persons who expect perfection from others experience and behave in daily life situations? To address this question, we investigated the relations of other-oriented perfectionism with the Big Five personality traits, the Big Five personality states (i.e., self-reported short-term behavior), and perceived situation characteristics using Experience Sampling Method (ESM). On the first day of the study, participants (n = 176) completed measures of other-oriented perfectionism and the Big Five personality traits. At random time points over the next 7 days, participants completed real-time situation reports containing the Big Five personality states and the DIAMONDS situation characteristics. Other-oriented perfectionism was negatively related to state and trait Agreeableness. Additionally, other-oriented perfectionism was associated with the perception of daily life situations as low in Duty, pOsitivity, and Sociality. Several relations of other-oriented perfectionism with personality states were moderated by situation characteristics. Our study confirms disagreeable behavior as a core characteristic of other-oriented perfectionism. Additionally, other-oriented perfectionists hold somewhat unfavorable views of their daily life situations. The moderating effects of situation characteristics on the relations between other-oriented perfectionism and personality states might explain why other-oriented perfectionism displays low and inconsistent relations with other trait-level measures.",2019,,Personality and Individual Differences,151,,109490,,10.1016/j.paid.2019.06.033,,#2485,Stricker 2019,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Global Self-Esteem Differentially Predicts Multidimensional Perfectionism in Early Adolescents Two Years Later,"Stricker, Johannes; Preckel, Franzis","Perfectionism is a multidimensional personality trait whose facets differentially relate to indicators of psychological functioning, such as global self-esteem. There has been some theoretical disagreement whether perfectionism affects global self-esteem, or vice versa. This question merits renewed attention due to increasing efforts to prevent the development of maladaptive perfectionism facets in adolescents. In addition, recent research has indicated a role of self-esteem for predicting personality development. This study aimed to clarify the longitudinal relations of multidimensional perfectionism and global self-esteem. A sample of 707 early adolescents participated in two measurement points two years apart. Global self-esteem positively predicted personal standards, negatively predicted doubts about actions, and did not predict concern over mistakes beyond baseline. Perfectionism facets did not longitudinally predict global self-esteem. These findings provide the first evidence for a role of global self-esteem in perfectionism development.

So far, environmental influences, e.g., the school environment, have gained only little attention in empirical research. Previous studies showed that school satisfaction influences the development of achievement-related individual differences, thus raising the question how it affects multidimensional perfectionism.

The Mental Health of German Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Supke, Max; Schulz, Wolfgang","Abstract. Theoretical background: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the daily lives of students completely. Studies indicated that psychology students may be less stressed during the pandemic than other students. This study compares psychology students and students from other disciplines regarding their mental health, alcohol consumption, and partnerships after the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study sample consisted of n = 127 psychology students and n = 579 students from other disciplines at the TU Braunschweig in Germany who participated in an online survey in June / July of 2021. To analyze the differences between the psychology students and students from other disciplines after the third wave, we calculated t-tests, Chi²-tests, and U-tests separately for female and male students. Results: Significantly fewer female psychology students were above the cut-off values for clinically relevant depressive symptoms (31.5 %; p &lt; .001, Cramer’s V = .32) and anxiety symptoms (22.2 %; p &lt; .001, Cramer’s V = .27) than other female students (depressive symptoms: 66.1 %; anxiety symptoms: 41.9 %). The small sample of male psychology students showed similar tendencies. While female psychology students rated their general health and life satisfaction higher than other female students, male psychology students were less concerned about their professional future than their respective counterparts. No differences were found concerning alcohol consumption and partnerships.

Emotion Regulation and its Influence on Body-Related Distress in Overweight Women,"Svaldi, Jennifer; Naumann, Eva; Trentowska, Monika; Lackner, Helmut K.; Tuschen-Caffier, Brunna","Overweight and obese individuals are at greater risk for the development of a major depressive disorder. A main factor contributing to negative affect in obese women is body-related worrying. Given the potential benefits of various emotion regulation (ER) strategies in the modification of negative affect, the aim of the present study was to test whether experimentally-induced body dissatisfaction can be modified by ER strategies in obese women. Body dissatisfaction was experimentally induced in a group of 37 obese women using model pictures. Following this, participants were randomly assigned to two different ER strategies: rumination on present emotions and thoughts, or acceptance of whatever thoughts and feelings come up. Weight and appearance satisfaction, distress about body feelings and mood were assessed both prior to, immediately after, and 4 min after the induction. Psychophysiological parameters were assessed continuously. The main results reveal that after the use of ER strategies, weight and appearance satisfaction returned to baseline levels. However, in the rumination condition, distress about body feelings remained above and mood below baseline. In the acceptance condition distress and mood returned to baseline levels. The results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of ER strategies with regard to reducing body-related distress.",2013,,Journal of Experimental Psychopathology,4,5,529-545,,10.5127/jep.028712,,#2495,Svaldi 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS

Due to an overlap between SM and social anxiety disorder (SAD) in children, similar mechanisms could apply to both disorders. Especially biased attentional processing of threat and fear-induced reduced visual exploration (referred to as attentive freezing) appear promising in SM. Methods A total of N = 84 children (8–12 years, SM: n = 28, SAD: n = 28, typical development (TD): n = 28) participated in an eye-tracking paradigm with videos of a social counterpart expressing a question, a social evaluation or a neutral statement. We investigated gaze behavior towards the social counterpart’s eye-region and the extent of visual exploration (length of scanpath), across conditions. Results There were no group differences regarding gaze behavior on the eye region. Neither gaze behavior with respect to the eye region nor visual exploration were dependent on the video condition. Compared to children with TD, children with SM generally showed less visual exploration, however children with SAD did not. Conclusion Reduced visual exploration might be due to the mechanism of attentive freezing, which could be part of an extensive fear response in SM that might also affect speech-production. Interventions that counteract the state of freezing could be promising for the therapy of SM.",2022,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,46,3,629-645,,10.1007/s10608-021-10289-3,,#2510,Vogel 2022,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Context Effects in the Evaluation of Bodily Symptoms: Comparing Three Versions of the Health Norms Sorting Task,"Weck, Florian; Witthöft, Michael","The illness-related evaluation of bodily symptoms is considered to be an important maintaining factor in somatoform disorders. However, little is known about context variables that could influence this evaluation process. In the current study, participants completed three versions of the Health Norms Sorting Task (HNST) and evaluated bodily symptoms in different contexts (i.e., different evaluation perspectives and time frames of evaluation). Additionally, the three HNST versions were presented in different orders. Bodily symptoms were evaluated more often as a sign of illness when a specific time frame (i.e., one week) was given. However, this context effect was only large when participants had previously evaluated symptoms existing without a concrete duration. Thus, previously completed symptom evaluations appear to represent an important frame of reference in terms of a cue that makes specific context variables salient. The results further suggested that these cueing effects might be less relevant for participants with elevated somatic symptom reports.",2017,,Journal of Experimental Psychopathology,8,3,141-151,,10.5127/jep.054216,,#2519,Weck 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,JD
Reappraising fear: is up-regulation more efficient than down-regulation?,"Wiemer, Julian; Rauner, Milena M.; Stegmann, Yannik; Pauli, Paul","Abstract Catastrophizing thoughts may contribute to the development of anxiety, but functional emotion regulation may help to improve treatment. No study so far directly compared up- and down-regulation of fear by cognitive reappraisal. Here, healthy individuals took part in a cued fear experiment, in which multiple pictures of faces were paired twice with an unpleasant scream or presented as safety stimuli. Participants (N = 47) were asked (within-subjects) to down-regulate, to up-regulate and to maintain their natural emotional response. Valence and arousal ratings indicated successful up- and down-regulation of the emotional experience, while heart rate and pupil dilation increased during up-regulation, but showed no reduction in down-regulation. State and trait anxiety correlated with evaluations of safety but not threat stimuli, which supports the role of deficient safety learning in anxiety. Reappraisal did not modulate this effect. In conclusion, this study reveals evidence for up-regulation effects in fear, which might be even more efficient than down-regulation on a physiological level and highlights the importance of catastrophizing thoughts for the maintenance of fear and anxiety.",2021,,Motivation and Emotion,45,2,221-234,,10.1007/s11031-021-09871-9,,#2523,Wiemer 2021,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Mental Defeat and Cumulative Trauma Experiences Predict Trauma-Related Psychopathology: Evidence From a Postconflict Population in Northern Uganda,"Wilker, Sarah; Kleim, Birgit; Geiling, Angelika; Pfeiffer, Anett; Elbert, Thomas; Kolassa, Iris-Tatjana","The peritraumatic cognitive process of mental defeat, the complete loss of inner resistance, has been identified as a key predictor of PTSD. Yet, most evidence on cognitive risk factors stems from industrialized countries where survivors typically report few traumata. Research from postconflict settings indicates that individual differences decrease with accumulating traumatic experiences, as almost everybody develops PTSD at extreme levels of trauma load. Would this leave less room for the impact of cognitive processes? In a sample of 227 Ugandan rebel war survivors, we investigated whether mental defeat influences trauma-related psychopathology in regression models accounting for cumulative trauma exposure. We found strong main effects of mental defeat on lifetime PTSD risk, current PTSD severity and dissociative symptoms, but no mental defeat × trauma load interaction effects. Our results indicate that peritraumatic mental defeat is central to understand individual differences in psychological reactions after single traumatic events as well as multiple traumatization.",2017,,Clinical Psychological Science,5,6,974-984,,10.1177/2167702617719946,,#2524,Wilker 2017,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
CBT-BASED TELEPHONE INTERVENTION FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA,"Wilz, G.","To prevent caregivers from the development of stress related health impairments, effective interventions are still needed. This presentation focused on the evaluation of a telephone intervention for family caregivers of people with dementia in Germany. The individual intervention (12 sessions in 6 months, each 50 minutes) uses cognitive-behavioural therapy adapted to specific problems of the caregivers. The intervention aims to improve well-being, quality of life and to reduce body complaints and depressive symptoms. A randomized controlled trial (N = 322 primary family caregivers) was conducted and the intervention was implemented by cognitive-behavioural therapists. Compared with caregivers in the control condition, caregivers who received Tele.TAnDem demonstrated significantly greater improvements in well-being, depressive symptoms (CES-D), body complaints (GBB-24) and quality of life (WHO-Qol-Bref) at post treatment measurement. Regarding the achievement of caregivers individual goals, results showed that 77% achieved complete goal attainment. Findings support the acceptability and effectiveness of the Tele.TAnDem intervention.",2017,,Innovation in Aging,1,suppl_1,666-667,,10.1093/geroni/igx004.2366,,#2525,Wilz 2017,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Problematic smartphone use has detrimental effects on mental health and somatic symptoms in a heterogeneous sample of German adults,"Winkler, Alexander; Jeromin, Franziska; Doering, Bettina K.; Barke, Antonia","Abstract Although research examining the association between problematic smartphone use and mental health has grown recently, there is a lack of studies investigating possible associations with physical (somatic) symptoms. Moreover, many studies are based on student samples from North America and China, limiting their generalizability. The current study aimed to examine problematic smartphone use in a broad sample of German adults. An online survey comprising demographic questions, problematic smartphone use scales and somatic symptom inventories, as well as depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality scales was completed by 930 participants. Problematic smartphone users reported longer usage per day, more interruptions to activities to check their smartphones, and higher scores for stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and somatic symptoms than did unproblematic users. In comparison, both groups allocated similar proportions of time to various applications. The results showed small to moderate bivariate associations between problematic smartphone use and indicators of mental health and somatic symptoms, while a multivariate analysis highlighted the importance of perceived stress. Since mental health and somatic symptoms are associated with problematic smartphone use, future studies should investigate the causal direction of the associations found.",2020,,Computers in Human Behavior,113,,106500,,10.1016/j.chb.2020.106500,,#2526,Winkler 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Somatic Symptom Perception and Interoception,"Witthöft, Michael; Bräscher, Anne-Kathrin; Jungmann, Stefanie M.; Köteles, Ferenc","Abstract. Models of chronic somatic symptoms assume that abnormalities in interoception are related to the development and maintenance of symptom distress. Different models, however, disagree on the exact nature of the assumed abnormality: cognitive-behavioral models stress a hypervigilant cognitive style (predicting higher interoceptive accuracy) whereas predictive processing models assume a less detailed sensory processing (predicting lower interoceptive accuracy). This study aimed at testing the relationship between interoception and symptom perception. Using structural equation modeling, associations between cardiac interoception and symptom perception were tested in a sample of students ( n = 316) and a second heterogeneous sample ( n = 340, including 63 patients with either pathological health anxiety or a somatoform disorder according to DSM-IV). Stronger sensory symptom perceptions in the cardiorespiratory system were associated with lower interoceptive accuracy in sample 2. The findings are more in line with the predictive processing approach, suggesting less detailed and more biased interoception being associated with chronic somatic symptom distress.",2020,,Zeitschrift für Psychologie,228,2,100-109,,10.1027/2151-2604/a000403,,#2527,Witthöft 2020,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Cognitive Biases in Pathological Health Anxiety,"Witthöft, Michael; Kerstner, Tobias; Ofer, Julia; Mier, Daniela; Rist, Fred; Diener, Carsten; Bailer, Josef","Pathological health anxiety refers to the medically unfounded fear of suffering from a severe illness. Differences in cognitive processes related to attention, memory, and evaluation of health threat have been hypothesized to underlie pathological health anxiety. In no study, however, have researchers systematically and simultaneously assessed different cognitive biases. On the basis of the idea that multiple cognitive biases simultaneously contribute to psychopathology (the combined-cognitive-bias hypothesis), we compared 88 patients with pathological health anxiety, 52 patients with depressive disorder, and 52 healthy participants on their performance in several cognitive tasks involving health-threatening content. Individuals with pathological health anxiety showed a stronger attentional bias to health-threat-related information, more negative explicit (but not implicit) evaluations of health threat, and biased response behavior in light of health threat. The results suggest that stronger bindings between feelings of arousal and health-threatening information in working memory might be crucial for the higher salience of health-threatening contents in pathological health anxiety.",2015,,Clinical Psychological Science,4,3,464-479,,10.1177/2167702615593474,,#2528,Witthöft 2015,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
An Analysis of the Pattern of Adaptive Emotion Regulation Associated with Low Paranoid Ideation in Healthy and Clinical Samples,"Wittkamp, Martin F.; Krkovic, Katarina; Lincoln, Tania M.","Abstract Background Research on emotion regulation and paranoid ideation has mostly focused on isolated regulation strategies and has remained largely inconclusive. According to the emotion regulation model by Berking and Whitley (in: Affect Regulation Training, Springer, New York 2014) successful modification or acceptance/tolerance of emotions requires an adequate comprehension (awareness, clarity, understanding) of emotions and adequate self-support. Method Building on this model, we investigated whether comprehension and self-support strengthen the negative association between modification and acceptance/tolerance and paranoid ideation. In study 1, we examined the hypotheses cross-sectionally based on questionnaire data from a combined sample ( N = 125) consisting of people with a psychotic disorder, people at risk of developing psychosis, and healthy controls. In study 2, we examined the same hypotheses longitudinally by employing the experience sampling method in people with clinically relevant psychopathology below diagnostic threshold ( N = 138). Results In study 1, the association between modification and paranoid ideation was not moderated by comprehension or self-support. However, comprehension and self-support moderated the association between acceptance/tolerance and paranoid ideation. In study 2, the interaction effect between comprehension and acceptance/tolerance on paranoid ideation was confirmed. Conclusion The results indicate that comprehending and accepting/tolerating emotions could be protective against paranoid ideation.",2020,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,45,3,468-479,,10.1007/s10608-020-10173-6,,#2529,Wittkamp 2020,,en,0.0,MNR,LS
Make the manikin move: Symbolic approach–avoidance responses affect implicit and explicit face evaluations,"Woud, Marcella L.; Maas, Joyce; Becker, Eni S.; Rinck, Mike","The present research aimed to replicate and extend findings of Huijding, Muris, Lester, Field, and Joosse (2011), investigating whether symbolic approach–avoidance responses can induce implicit and explicit evaluation biases. Faces with a neutral expression were shown on a computer screen, and participants were instructed to repeatedly move a manikin towards some faces (approach) and away from other faces (avoidance). An affective priming task and a face rating task were used to assess training-compatible differences in implicit and explicit face evaluations, respectively. Results showed that the manikin training was successful: The priming task revealed more positive implicit evaluations of approached than avoided faces, and approached faces were rated more positively than avoided ones in the face rating task. These findings replicate those of Huijding and colleagues by demonstrating training effects on explicit evaluations, and they extend them by demonstrating effects on implicit evaluations.",2013,,Journal of Cognitive Psychology,25,6,738-744,,10.1080/20445911.2013.817413,,#2533,Woud 2013,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
Alcohol Homograph Priming in Alcohol-Dependent Inpatients,"Woud, Marcella L.; Salemink, Elske; Gladwin, Thomas E.; Wiers, Reinout W.; Becker, Eni S.; Lindenmeyer, Johannes; Rinck, Mike","Abstract. Aim: Alcohol dependency is characterized by alcohol-related interpretation biases (IBs): Individuals with high levels of alcohol consumption generate more alcohol-related than alcohol-unrelated interpretations in response to ambiguous alcohol-related cues. However, a response bias could be an alternative account, meaning that individuals with high levels of alcohol consumption generate more alcohol-related IBs because of a greater baseline tendency to endorse alcohol-related responses. Methods: To test this alternative explanation, the present study employed a homograph-priming task, reliability of which was also examined. The sample included 577 clinically diagnosed alcohol-dependent inpatients and 61 control inpatients. Participants completed a homograph priming task (primes: homographs with and without an alcohol-related meaning, target words: alcohol and soft drinks) before commencing their behavioral cognitive treatment at a rehabilitation clinic. Results: Contrary to our expectations, we did not find an enhanced priming effect in alcohol-dependent inpatients. Moreover, there was no correlation between the priming score and levels of harmful drinking (AUDIT scores). Conclusions: The data provide limited support for the existence of alcohol-related IBs, possibly because of the low reliability of the priming task, the features of the task, and the study’s design.",2016,,SUCHT,62,4,217-224,,10.1024/0939-5911/a000432,,#2534,Woud 2016,,en,0.0,MNR,LS

Factor Structure and Psychometric Properties of the German Version of                     the Family Expressiveness Questionnaire (FEQ-GR),"Zehtner, Raphaela I.; Baeurle, Cosima L.; Walter, Bertram; Stark, Rudolf; Hermann, Andrea","Abstract. Background: This study aimed to develop a German version of the Family Expressiveness Questionnaire (FEQ; Halberstadt, 1983 , 1986 ), which investigates emotional expressiveness within the family context while growing up. While a theoretically derived four-factor structure was postulated, 2- and 3-scale versions have been applied in research. Methods: In Study 1 ( N = 650), these existing models were tested against each other. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for the solution that best fitted the data with half of the sample, and results were cross-validated in the other half. Construct validation was investigated in Study 2 ( N = 225). Results: An acceptable model fit for a three-factor solution was attained in Study 1. In Study 2, correlation patterns indicated a good convergent and discriminant validity. Reliability estimates in both studies were in an acceptable to excellent range.

Thought Conditioning: Inducing and Reducing Thoughts About the Aversive Outcome in a Fear-Conditioning Procedure,"Zenses, Ann-Kathrin; Baeyens, Frank; Beckers, Tom; Boddez, Yannick","The human fear-conditioning paradigm is a widely used procedure to study anxiety. However, merely thinking about the aversive outcome is typically not measured in this procedure. This is surprising because thinking of an aversive event is of clinical relevance (e.g., in the form of intrusions) and theoretical interest. We present two preregistered studies that (a) included thinking of an aversive outcome as an additional dependent variable and (b) compared several interventions to reduce it. We found that mere thinking of an aversive outcome could be successfully conditioned. Among the participants who showed successful acquisition, extinction training was less successful in reducing it than counterconditioning. Presenting new additional outcomes also proved effective to reduce thoughts about the initial outcome when the new outcomes were positive stimuli. Including thinking of the aversive outcome as an additional dependent variable may serve to enhance the understanding of anxiety-related disorders and inform their treatment.",2021,,Clinical Psychological Science,9,2,252-269,,10.1177/2167702620954222,,#2539,Zenses 2021,,en,1.0,PRO,LS
The perceived stress scale: Reliability and validity study in the Czech Republic,"Figalová, Nikol; ; Charvát, Miroslav","Objectives. The aim of this study was to create a Czech translation of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), to assess its psychometric properties on a representative sample of the Czech general adult population, and to compare the original 14-item version (PSS-14) with the shortened 10-item (PSS-10) and four-item (PSS-4) versions. Sample and setting. Two pilot studies were conducted to create the final Czech translation of the scale (n = 365 and n = 420). The final version of the Czech PSS was administered to a sample of the Czech general adult population (n = 1725 of whom 981 were women, M = 44.32, SD = 12.8). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) or the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were administered alongside the PSS to a part of the sample. A retest measurement after 14 days was conducted (n = 159). Statistical analysis. Using the confirmatory factor analysis, the one-factor, two-factor and bifactor models were compared. The internal consistency, stability in time, and convergent validity of the scale, as well as the known-group differences, were assessed. The three versions of the PSS were compared. Results. The confirmatory factor analysis supported the bifactor model of the PSS-14 and PSS-10, and the two-factor model of the PSS-4. All versions of the scale showed good internal consistency and stability in time. There was a moderate to strong positive correlation between the PSS and the BDI-II and STAI. Differences based on age, sex, education level, and situational factors were found. Overall, the PSS-10 showed the best psychometric properties of all three versions of the scale. Study limitation.
