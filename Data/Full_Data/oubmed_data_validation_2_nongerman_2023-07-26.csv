Thirty-two older adults were divided into three groups: Pilates group, Dance group, and Control group. Static and dynamic balance was assessed with following tasks: (a) tandem stance, (b) one-leg stance, and (c) periodic sway with and without metronome guidance. Analysis revealed a significant reduction of the trunk sway amplitude during the tandem stance with eyes closed, reduction in the center of pressure (CoP) displacement during one-leg stance, and increase in the amplitude of trunk oscillation during the sway task for both intervention groups, and reduction in the standard deviation of the CoP displacement during the metronome paced task only for the dance group. The differences in specific balance indices between the two programs suggest some specific adaptations that may provide useful knowledge for the selection of exercises that are better tailored to the needs of the old adult.",0,MNR,LS

One strategy individuals could use to increase physical activity is to exercise mindfully (i.e., while paying attention to present-moment experiences with acceptance. A mindfulness-based intervention for exercise can be delivered via an audio recording, which is advantageous in regard to time demands, cost, and dissemination potential. The aims of this parallel two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an audio-recorded mindfulness-based intervention and to assess whether the intervention resulted in a clinically meaningful difference in physical activity compared with the control condition. Physically underactive adults (N = 50) were randomized to a mindfulness intervention condition in which they were instructed to exercise while listening to an audio-recorded mindfulness-intervention or an active control group in which they were instructed to exercise while using a heart rate monitor. Participants completed a 30-minute moderate intensity treadmill exercise bout during a baseline in-laboratory session in the manner in which they were randomized (i.e., mindfulness recording versus using a heart rate monitor) and instructed to exercise in this manner for the next week. At follow-up, acceptability was measured by self-report, feasibility by frequency of intervention use, and physical activity using both self-reported physical activity recall and an accelerometer. The audio-recorded mindfulness-based physical activity intervention was rated as acceptable and feasible to use. Compared with the control group, the intervention also resulted in clinically meaningful differences in self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes (mean difference = 67.16 minutes) and accelerometer-measured minutes (mean difference = 35.48 minutes) during a 1-week follow-up. The audio-recorded mindfulness-based physical activity intervention is a promising approach to increasing physical activity with good dissemination potential.",0,MNR,LS

This study is the first to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of yoga within a weight management program following WL treatment. 60 women with overweight or obesity (34.3±3.9 kg/m2, 48.1±10.1 years) were randomized to receive a 12-week yoga intervention (2x/week; YOGA) or a structurally equivalent control (cooking/nutrition classes; CON), following a 3-month behavioral WL program. Feasibility (attendance, adherence, retention) and acceptability (program satisfaction ratings) were assessed. Treatment groups were compared on weight change, mindfulness, distress tolerance, stress, affect, and self-compassion at 6 months. Initial WL (3-mo WL) was evaluated as a potential moderator. Attendance, retention, and program satisfaction ratings of yoga were high. Treatment groups did not differ on WL or psychological constructs (with exception of one mindfulness subscale) at 6 months. However, among those with high initial WL (≥5%), YOGA lost significantly more weight (-9.0kg vs. -6.7kg) at 6 months and resulted in greater distress tolerance, mindfulness, and self-compassion and lower negative affect, compared to CON. Study findings provide preliminary support for yoga as a potential strategy for improving long-term WL among those losing ≥5% in standard behavioral treatment.",0,MNR,LS

It has been shown that subjects who do not stop binge eating after an initial structured cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) programme benefit from additional CBT (A-CBT) sessions; however, it has been suggested that these resistant patients would benefit even more from cue exposure therapy (CET) targeting features associated with poor response (e.g. urge to binge in response to a cue and anxiety experienced in the presence of binge-related cues). We assessed the effectiveness of virtual reality-CET as a second-level treatment strategy for 64 patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder who had been treated with limited results after using a structured CBT programme, in comparison with A-CBT. The significant differences observed between the two groups at post-treatment in dimensional (behavioural and attitudinal features, anxiety, food craving) and categorical (abstinence rates) outcomes highlighted the superiority of virtual reality-CET over A-CBT.

To facilitate dissemination, a multicouple, rolling admission Group BCT (G-BCT) format has been suggested as an alternative to the 1 couple at a time, conjoint Standard BCT (S-BCT) format. This randomized study compared outcomes of G-BCT versus S-BCT over a 1-year follow-up. The authors predicted that G-BCT, as compared to S-BCT, would have equivalent (i.e., noninferior) improvements on substance and relationship outcomes. Participants were patients (N = 101) with alcohol dependence and their heterosexual relationship partners without substance use disorder. Participants were mostly White, in their 40s, and 30% of patients were women. Patients were randomized to either G-BCT plus 12-step-oriented IBT or S-BCT plus IBT. Primary outcomes included Timeline Followback Interview percentage days abstinent and Inventory of Drug Use Consequences measure of substance-related problems. Secondary outcome was Dyadic Adjustment Scale. Outcome data were collected at baseline, posttreatment, and quarterly for 1-year follow-up. Results overall found no support for the predicted statistical equivalency of G-BCT and S-BCT. Rather than the predicted equivalent outcomes, substance and relationship outcomes were significantly worse for G-BCT than S-BCT in the last 6-9 months of the 12-month follow-up period, because G-BCT deteriorated and S-BCT maintained gains during follow-up. This was the first study of the newer rolling admission group format for BCT. It proved to have worse not equivalent outcomes compared to standard conjoint BCT. (PsycINFO Database Record",0,MNR,LS

This study examined whether family-focused treatment for adolescents (FFT-A) with BD I or II disorder led to greater increases in family cohesion and adaptability and decreases in conflict over 2 years compared to a briefer psychoeducational treatment (enhanced care, EC). Participants were 144 adolescents (mean age: 15.6 ± 1.4 years) with BD I or II with a mood episode in the previous 3 months. Adolescents and parents were randomized to either FFT-A (21 sessions) or EC (three sessions). Patients received guideline-based pharmacotherapy throughout the 2-year study. Trajectories of adolescent- and parent-rated family cohesion, adaptability, and conflict were analyzed over 2 years. FFT-A had greater effects on adolescent-rated family cohesion compared to EC over 2 years. Participants in FFT-A and EC reported similar improvements in family conflict across the 2 years. In the FFT-A group, low-conflict families had greater adolescent-rated family cohesion throughout the study compared to high-conflict families. High-conflict families in both treatment groups tended to show larger reductions in conflict over 2 years than low-conflict families.

The current study examined the efficacy of Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST), a group prevention program for adolescent depression, in comparison to group programs that are typically delivered in school settings. In this indicated prevention trial, 186 adolescents with elevated depression symptoms were randomized to receive IPT-AST delivered by research staff or group counseling (GC) delivered by school counselors. Hierarchical linear modeling examined differences in rates of change in depressive symptoms and overall functioning from baseline to the 6-month follow-up assessment. Cox regression compared rates of depression diagnoses. Adolescents in IPT-AST showed significantly greater improvements in self-reported depressive symptoms and evaluator-rated overall functioning than GC adolescents from baseline to the 6-month follow-up. However, there were no significant differences between the two conditions in onset of depression diagnoses. Although both intervention conditions demonstrated significant improvements in depressive symptoms and overall functioning, results indicate that IPT-AST has modest benefits over groups run by school counselors which were matched on frequency and duration of sessions. In particular, IPT-AST outperformed GC in reduction of depressive symptoms and improvements in overall functioning. These findings point to the clinical utility of this depression prevention program, at least in the short-term. Additional follow-up is needed to determine the long-term effects of IPT-AST, relative to GC, particularly in preventing depression onset.",0,MNR,LS

Health promotion during adolescence has been shown to contribute to the prevention of late onset of the mental health disease. However, scalable interventions have not been established yet. This study was designed to test the efficacy of two adolescent health promotion interventions: a well-care visit (WCV) with a risk assessment interview and counseling and self-monitoring with a smartphone cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) app. Our hypothesis was that participants who had received both WCV and the CBT app would have better outcomes than those who had received only WCV or those who had not received any intervention. We conducted a prospective multi-institutional randomized controlled trial. Participants were 217 adolescents aged 13-18 years. They were randomly divided into two intervention groups (WCV group and WCV with CBT app group) and a nonintervention group. WCV comprised a standardized physical examination along with a structured interview and counseling for youth risk assessment, which was designed with reference to the Guideline for Health Supervision of Adolescents of Bright Futures. A smartphone-based CBT program was developed based on the CBT approach. The CBT app comprised a 1-week psychoeducation component and a 1-week self-monitoring component. During the CBT program, participants created several self-monitoring sheets based on the CBT model with five window panels: event, thoughts, feelings, body response, and actions. The primary outcome was the change in scores for depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes included changes in scores for self-esteem, quality of life, self-monitoring, and an adolescent health promotion scale. These outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 2, and 4 months after baseline. The exploratory outcome was the presence of suicidal ideation during the observation period. Intervention effects were estimated using mixed effect models. In total, 94% (204/217) of the participants completed the 4-month evaluation. Both intervention groups showed a significant effect in the form of reduced scores for depressive symptoms at 1 month in high school students; however, these effects were not observed at 2 and 4 months. The intervention effect was significantly more predominant in those scoring above cutoff for depressive symptoms. There was significantly less suicidal ideation in the intervention groups. As for secondary outcomes, there was significant increase in health promotion scale scores at the 4-month follow-up among junior high school students in the WCV group. Moreover, the CBT app was significantly effective in terms of obtaining self-monitoring skills and reducing depressive symptoms. Although adolescent health promotion interventions may have short-term benefits, the frequency of WCV and further revision of the CBT app should be considered to evaluate long-term effectiveness.

Thirty veterans started treatment and 26 completed. PE resulted in significantly more symptom reduction than PCT (P = .008). High treatment responders collapsed across treatments showed nominally higher cortisol levels measured at pretreatment 30 min after trauma script exposure compared to low responders (P = .08). At midtreatment, high treatment responders showed higher cortisol levels throughout the imagery task (Ps = .03-.04).

Cognitive reactivity appears to be a risk factor for relapse. It remains unclear, however, whether dysfunctional cognitions alone or the reactivity of such cognitions to mild states of sadness (ie, cognitive reactivity) is the crucial factor that increases relapse risk. We aimed to assess the long-term predictive value of cognitive reactivity versus dysfunctional cognitions and other risk factors for depressive relapse. In a prospective cohort of outpatients (N = 116; studied between 2000-2005) who had experienced ≥ 2 previous major depressive episodes (MDEs) and were in remission (DSM-IV) at the start of follow-up, we measured cognitive reactivity, with the Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity (LEIDS), and dysfunctional cognitions, with the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, simultaneously. Course of illness (with the primary outcome of MDE assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders Patient Edition) and time to relapse were monitored prospectively for 3.5 years. Cognitive reactivity scores were associated with time to relapse over the 3.5-year follow-up and also when corrected for the number of previous MDEs and concurrent depressive symptoms (hazard ratio for 1 standard deviation [(HR(SD)); 20 points of the LEIDS, measuring cognitive reactivity] = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04-2.09; P = .031). Rumination appeared to be a particularly strong predictor of relapse (HR(SD) = 1.60; 95% CI, 1.13-2.26; P = .007). Dysfunctional cognitions did not predict relapse over 3.5 years (HR(SD) = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.74-1.37; P = .93). Every 20-point increase on the cognitive reactivity scale resulted in a 10% to 15% increase in risk of relapse (corrected for previous MDEs and concurrent depressive symptoms). Cognitive reactivity--and particularly rumination--is a long-term predictor of relapse. Future research should address whether psychological interventions can improve cognitive reactivity scores and thereby prevent depressive relapses. ISRCTN Identifier: 68246470.",0,MNR,LS

Most intervention studies recruit individuals from treatment providers, potentially neglecting those individuals who are not already engaged in services. These individuals clearly represent a group in need of additional empirical attention. A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare a single-session dialectical behavior therapy skills-based intervention to a relaxation training control condition. Ninety-three non-treatment-engaged subjects participated in a single in-person assessment, received one of the intervention protocols, and completed follow-up phone interviews for three months including measures of suicidal ideation, emotion dysregulation, and coping skills, as well as other relevant assessments. Both conditions reported significantly reduced levels of suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety; however, analyses revealed no significant differences between conditions on the main outcome measures of suicidal ideation, emotion dysregulation, skills use, depression, or anxiety. The two interventions may have been too similar to permit detection of differential effects with this sample size. Specifically, the control condition may have been too active and there may have been stylistic overlap by providers who delivered both interventions. Encouragingly, half of subjects contacted other mental health services during the follow-up period. Although the two interventions under investigation did not yield differential results, the significant changes in important domains across interventions suggest that brief interventions may hold promise for this difficult-to-reach population.",0,MNR,LS

Materials and Methods: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial that was conducted on 180 breastfeeding women from January to May 2019. The participants were allocated to three groups of Citrus aurantium (n = 60), Lavender (n = 60), and control (n = 60) groups. Two groups of intervention used 2 drops of essential oil, twice a day, for 40 days as inhalation. The control group received almond oil in the same. The sexual satisfaction was evaluated using the Linda Berg's Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire before the intervention and 40 days after the intervention started. The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software, version 21, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: After the 40 days of intervention, the mean score of sexual satisfaction was significantly higher in the Citrus aurantium and Lavender groups compared with the control group (59.3 ± 11.7, 59.3 ± 11.6 vs. 52.02 ± 11.5, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between Lavender and Citrus aurantium groups. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that the aroma of Citrus aurantium and Lavender essence could significantly improve the sexual satisfaction of breastfeeding women. Therefore, it is recommended that health care providers should inform the breastfeeding women and advise them to use these interventions for increase of the sexual satisfaction.

A randomized preference trial of CBT and yoga was conducted in community-dwelling adults 60 years or older, who scored 26 or above on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire-Abbreviated (PSWQ-A). CBT consisted of 10 weekly telephone sessions. Yoga consisted of 20 biweekly group yoga classes. The primary outcome was worry (PSWQ-A); the secondary outcomes were anxiety (PROMIS-Anxiety) and sleep (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]). We examined both preference effects (average effect for those who received their preferred intervention [regardless of whether it was CBT or yoga] minus the average for those who did not receive their preferred intervention [regardless of the intervention]) and selection effect (which addresses the question of whether there is a benefit to getting to select one intervention over the other, and measures the effect on outcomes of self-selection to a specific intervention). Five hundred older adults were randomized to the randomized trial (125 each in CBT and yoga) or the preference trial (120 chose CBT; 130 chose yoga). In the randomized trial, the intervention effect of yoga compared with CBT adjusted for baseline psychotropic medication use, gender, and race was 1.6 (-0.2, 3.3), p = .08 for the PSWQ-A.

Technology-based interventions for SUD delivered in primary care settings are a potential strategy of efficiently delivering treatment to those who need it. We conducted a randomized clinical trial evaluating feasibility, satisfaction, and substance use outcomes for 58 individuals with SUD. Participants being treated in a primary care practice which provides integrated addiction treatment were randomized to standard care or standard care plus access to a web-based SUD intervention (computer-based training in cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT4CBT). Self-reported substance use and urine toxicology screens were assessed at 8 weeks after randomization. Uptake of CBT4CBT in this setting was high; 77% of those assigned to this condition accessed the program at least once; of those, 77% completed all 7 modules. Satisfaction with the program was very high. Participants reported >90% days abstinent for all classes of drugs; with no significant differences between conditions. This study demonstrates feasibility of implementing technology-based treatments in primary care settings to address weak follow-through with the referral component of SBIRT. The overall positive outcomes in this specialized, integrated treatment setting may have undercut the ability to demonstrate differential effects on substance use; results suggest evaluation in less specialized primary care settings is warranted. clinicaltrials.gov NCT03013478.",0,MNR,LS

Ratings were compared to experts' ratings of ideal TFP, DBT, and mentalizing-enhancing principles to quantify conformity to ideal treatments. Reflective functioning was assessed at pre- and posttreatment. Differences among treatments in conformity and its relation with change in reflective functioning were examined. Conformity to TFP and mentalizing-enhancing principles was highest in TFP (ps < .01) while conformity to DBT principles was high in DBT and SPT (DBT vs. SPT: p > .40), but lower in TFP (ps < .01).

Women with significant spider fear were randomized to three 30-minute sessions of exposure therapy involving repeated contact with a dirt mixture (n=17) or a waitlist control condition (n=17). Assessments of spider fear and disgust were administered at baseline and at one-week posttreatment. At high (but not low) levels of pretreatment disgust propensity, exposure led to lower in vivo spider fear and perceived danger than waitlist, though exposure had no effects on spider-related disgust. Similar effects of exposure on spider fear were found at high levels of pretreatment spider-related disgust. Exposure also reduced fear and danger perceptions, but not disgust, related to a separate contamination assessment (touching a toilet). No effects of treatment were found on self-report measures of spider fear or disgust propensity.

Overall, there was a statistically significant cost difference of €9,543 when comparing IPS with SAU and €7,288 when comparing IPSE with SAU. ICER's did generally not render statistically significant results. However, there was a tendency toward the IPS and IPSE interventions being dominant, that is, cheaper with greater effect in health-related quality of life and hours in employment or education compared to usual care.

However, there is considerable variability in the frequency of treatment sessions (e.g., once per week or twice per week) in clinical practice. Moreover, clients often cancel or reschedule treatment sessions, leading to even greater variability in treatment session timing. The goal of the current study is to investigate the impact of PTSD treatment session frequency on treatment outcome. One hundred thirty-six women (Mage = 32.16 [SD = 9.90]) with PTSD were randomized to receive cognitive processing therapy or prolonged exposure. PTSD symptom outcome was measured using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, and session frequency and consistency were measured using dates of treatment session attendance. Session frequency was operationalized using average days between session, and consistency was defined by the standard deviation of the number of days between treatment sessions. Piecewise growth curve modeling revealed that higher average days between sessions was associated with significantly smaller PTSD symptom reduction, with more frequent sessions yielding greater PTSD symptom reduction (p < .001, d = .82). Higher consistency was also associated with significantly greater PTSD symptom reduction (p < .01, d = .48). The substantially larger effect size for frequency suggests that average days between treatment sessions impacts treatment outcome more than consistency. Follow-up analyses revealed a longer time interval between Sessions 4 and 5 was associated with smaller reductions in PTSD treatment outcome. More frequent scheduling of sessions may maximize PTSD treatment outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record",0,MNR,LS

Data were drawn from a randomized controlled trial assessing acute and maintenance therapies for chronic insomnia (n = 80). The present analyses assessed the percentage of participants that 1) reached (≥ 0 minute increase) and 2) appreciably exceeded (≥ 30 minutes increase) baseline TST as assessed via daily sleep diaries at posttreatment and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following treatment. By the end of acute treatment, 45% of participants reached or exceeded baseline TST. By 24 months follow-up, this percentage had increased to 86%. Only 17% of participants achieved a 30-minute increase in TST by the end of acute treatment, and this proportion only increased to 58% over time. These findings suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in its current form does not appreciably increase self-reported TST in a significant proportion of patients with insomnia. Whether participants would benefit from further increases in TST warrants investigation.

To overcome these limitations, this study developed and implemented a modified version of motivational interviewing. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of a modified motivational interviewing (MMI) intervention on university students' psychological, cognitive, and nutritional health indicators. This randomized controlled trial study was conducted using an experimental, repeated-measures, two-group design. The authors developed a modified version of motivational interviewing, and its effect was investigated among university students. The final sample size in this study was 94 university students (intervention = 48 and control = 46). Psychological, cognitive, and nutritional health indicators were measured at baseline and 1 month postrandomization and 3 months postrandomization. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. The results of the multivariate analysis revealed a significant effect of the MMI intervention on the linear combination of the dependent variables: Pillai's trace = 0.28, F (9, 84) = 3.59, p = .001. The univariate analysis showed that the effect of the MMI intervention was significant on four dependent variables (namely, uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, perceived stress, and mindfulness). The MMI intervention improved university students' perceived stress, uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, and mindfulness. Further research should be conducted to validate the results reported in this article.",0,MNR,LS

Secondary aims were to investigate a possible difference in effectiveness between athletes with high and low proprioceptive acuity, and whether predictors of effectiveness could be found. Randomised cross-over pilot study. 24 athletes with PT (age 27.3±9.0, VISA-P 50.6±11.2) performed a joint position sense test with and without a patellar strap. The difference between both conditions was analysed using linear mixed-model analysis. No improvement in the joint position sense using the strap for the whole group was found, while those classified as having low proprioceptive acuity did improve using the strap (p=0.015, 17.2%). A larger knee girth, longer duration of symptoms and more tendon abnormalities were negatively associated with the strap's effectiveness. The use of a patellar strap improves the knee joint proprioception - measured with joint position sense - of the symptomatic leg in athletes with poor proprioceptive acuity. Especially athletes with relatively small knee girth, short duration of symptoms and small tendon abnormalities might benefit from the strap. As proprioception plays an important role in motor control, and deficits in proprioception may put an athlete at risk for (re-)injury, these findings may be relevant for prevention as well as rehabilitation purposes in those PT athletes with low proprioceptive acuity.",0,MNR,LS

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of immersive VR on upper extremity function in patients with ischemic stroke. Sixty-five patients with ischemic stroke were included in this randomized, controlled, double-blind study. Patients were randomly divided into VR (n = 33) and control (n = 32) groups. The VR group received 60 minutes of the upper extremity immersive VR rehabilitation program and the control group received 45 minutes of conventional therapy and 15 minutes of a sham VR program. Rehabilitation consisted of 18 sessions of therapy, three days per week, for six weeks. The outcome measures were the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Scale (FMUE) and Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills (PASS). In both the VR and control groups all parameters except the PASS improved over time. However independent t-test results showed that all of the FMUE, ARAT, FIM and PASS scores were significantly higher in the VR group compared with the control (p < 0.05). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) scores of the FMUE and ARAT were higher than the cut-off MCID scores described in the literature in the VR group, whereas the FIM scores were below the cut-off MCID scores. All scores in the control group were below the cut-off scores. Immersive VR rehabilitation appeared to be effective in improving upper extremity function and self-care skills, but it did not improve functional independence.",0,MNR,LS

The main aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of group multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy at reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, and improving quality of life and the clinical course of the disease. (2) Methods: A total of 120 patients were evaluated using the General Perceived Stress Scale, Scale of Stress Perceived by the Disease, the anxiety and depression scale, and quality of life questionnaire for patients with IBD. Disease activity was measured using the Mayo Index for ulcerative colitis and CDAI for Crohn's disease, as well as the number of relapses self-reported by patients. Patients were randomized to receive group multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy or treatment as usual.

This randomized controlled trial involved a total of 272 patients who were randomly assigned to either multicomponent treatment (n = 135) or treatment as usual (n = 137). The multicomponent treatment (2-hour weekly sessions) was delivered in groups of 20 participants. Treatment as usual was mainly based on pharmacological treatment according to the predominant symptoms. Data on functional impairment using the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire as the primary outcome were collected as were data for pain, fatigue, kinesiophobia, physical function, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes) at baseline, 12 weeks, and, for the multicomponent group only, 6 and 9 months. An intention-to-treat approach was used to analyze between-group differences. Baseline differences between responders (>20% Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire reduction) and nonresponders also were analyzed, and the number needed to treat was computed. At posttreatment, significant between-group differences with a large effect size (Cohen d > 0.80) in favor of the multicomponent treatment were found in functional impairment, pain, kinesiophobia, and physical function, whereas differences with a moderate size effect (Cohen d > 0.50 and <0.80) were found in fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Nonresponders scored higher on depressive symptoms than responders at baseline. The number needed to treat was 2 (95% CI = 1.7-2.3). Compared with usual care, there was evidence of short-term (up to 3 months) positive effects of the multicomponent treatment for fibromyalgia. Some methodological shortcomings (eg, absence of follow-up in the control group and monitoring of treatment adherence, potential research allegiance) preclude robust conclusions regarding the proposed multicomponent program. Despite some methodological shortcomings in the design of this study, the multicomponent therapy FIBROWALK can be considered a novel and effective treatment for patients with fibromyalgia. Physical therapists should detect patients with clinically relevant depression levels prior to treatment because depression can buffer treatment effects. Fibromyalgia is prevalent and can be expensive to treat. This multicomponent treatment could significantly improve the core symptoms of fibromyalgia compared with usual treatment.",0,MNR,LS

Evidence on how to treat maternal depression to improve longer-term maternal outcomes and reduce intergenerational transmission of psychopathology is scarce, particularly for task-shifted, low-intensity, and scalable psychosocial interventions. We evaluated the effects of a peer-delivered, psychosocial intervention on maternal depression and child development at 3 years postnatal. 40 village clusters in Pakistan were randomly allocated using a computerised randomisation sequence to receive a group-based, psychosocial intervention and enhanced usual care for 36 months, or enhanced usual care alone. Pregnant women (≥18 years) were screened for moderate or severe symptoms of depression (patient health questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] score ≥10) and were recruited into the trial (570 participants), and a cohort without depression (PHQ-9 score <10) was also enrolled (584 participants). Including the non-depressed dyads enabled us to determine how much of the excess risk due to maternal depression exposure the intervention could mitigate. Research teams responsible for identifying, obtaining consent, and recruiting trial participants were blind to the allocation status throughout the duration of the study, and principal investigators, site coordinators, statisticians, and members of the trial steering committee were also blinded to the allocation status until the analysis of 6-month data for the intervention. Primary outcomes were maternal depression symptoms and remission (PHQ-9 score <10) and child socioemotional skills (strengths and difficulties questionnaire [SDQ-TD]) at 36-months postnatal. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02658994. From Oct 15, 2014 to Feb 25, 2016 46 village clusters were assessed for eligibility, of which 40 (including 1910 mothers were enrolled. After exclusions, 288 women were randomly assigned to the enhanced usual care group and 284 to the intervention group, and 1159 women were included in a group without prenatal depression. At 36-months postnatal, complete data were available from 889 mother-child dyads: 206 (72·5%) in the intervention group, 216 (75·3%) in the enhanced usual care group, and 467 (80·0%) women who did not have prenatal-depression. We did not observe significant outcome differences between the intervention group and the enhanced usual care group for the primary outcomes. The standardised mean difference of PHQ-9 total score was -0·13 (95% CI -0·33 to 0·07), relative risk of patient health questionnaire-9 remission was 1·00 (95% CI 0·88 to 1·14), and the SDQ-TD treatment estimate was -0·10 (95% CI -1·39 to 1·19). Reduced symptom severity and high remission rates were seen across both the intervention and enhanced usual care groups, possibly masking any effects of the intervention. A multi-year, psychosocial intervention can be task-shifted via peers but might be susceptible to reductions in fidelity and dosage over time (which were not among the outcomes of this trial). Early intervention efforts might need to rely on multiple models (eg, collaborative care), be of greater intensity, and potentially targeted at mothers who are at high risk for depression to reduce the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology from mothers to children.

The families were assessed 6 and 18 months after beginning treatment. Parenting skills were measured using the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS), and child behavior problems were measured using the ECBI and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Linear growth curve analyses revealed that the behavior problems of children receiving PCIT improved more compared with children receiving TAU according to mother reports (ECBI d = .64, CBCL d = .61, both p < .05) but not according to father report. Parents also improved with regard to Do and Don't skills (d = 2.58, d = 1.46, respectively, both p ≤ .001).

There were significant time × group interactions in Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (F6,4.20 = 8.38, P < 0.001), event-related potential latent period (F6,294.24 = 5.10, P < 0.001), event-related potential amplitude (F6,1.68 = 23.08, P < 0.001), and Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (F6,312.61 = 5.42, P < 0.001). Intragroup comparisons showed that Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale and Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test scores and event-related potential amplitude increased significantly (P < 0.05), and event-related potential latency decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in all groups. Intergroup comparisons showed that the changes of all outcomes in mixed therapy group were greater than those in cognitive training and motor imagery + action observation group (P < 0.05) after treatment. These results suggest that the combination of cognitive training with motor imagery and action observation therapy is an effective treatment on cognitive function in people with vascular cognitive impairment.",0,MNR,LS

In addition, there is still a lack of research on the effects of occupation-based training and the effects of bilateral upper limb training that provides an intervention based on patients' state of hemiplegic upper limb function. This study investigated the effects of combining CBT and occupation-based bilateral upper limb training on the depression, anxiety, upper limb function, and occupational performance. The experimental group was given 30-min cognitive behavioral therapy and occupation-based bilateral upper limb training, while the control group was given 30-min conventional occupational therapy and occupation-based bilateral upper limb training. For both groups, the intervention was given as a 30-min session once a day and five times a week for 4 weeks. Following intervention, the experimental group showed significant within-group variance for automatic thoughts, depression, anxiety, upper limb function, and occupational performance only (p < 0.01). For between-group variance, a significant difference was found for automatic thoughts, depression, anxiety, and occupational performance (p < 0.01), however, not for upper limb function (p > 0.05).

Recent evidence suggests that 1 or 2 administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with treatment-resistant depression. To investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD. This randomized, waiting list-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population). Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay. The primary outcome, depression severity was assessed with the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores at baseline (score of ≥17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR). Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67%), and had a mean (SD) baseline GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean (SD) GRID-HAMD scores at weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4] and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group. The effect sizes were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5; P < .001) and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-3.7; P < .001). The QIDS-SR documented a rapid decrease in mean (SD) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4]; Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8-3.5; P < .001), which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.0; P < .001). In the overall sample, 17 participants (71%) at week 1 and 17 (71%) at week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention (≥50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score), and 14 participants (58%) at week 1 and 13 participants (54%) at week 4 were in remission (≤7 GRID-HAMD score). Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in treating MDD, thus extending the results of previous studies of this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a nonrandomized study in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

PTSD includes anxiety, flashbacks, and emotional numbing. The symptoms increase health care costs for stress-related illnesses and can make veterans' civilian life difficult. We used a randomized wait-list controlled design with repeated measures of U.S. military veterans to address our specific aim to test the efficacy of a 6-week therapeutic horseback riding (THR) program for decreasing PTSD symptoms and increasing coping self-efficacy, emotion regulation, social and emotional loneliness. Fifty-seven participants were recruited and 29 enrolled in the randomized trial. They were randomly assigned to either the horse riding group (n = 15) or a wait-list control group (n = 14). The wait-list control group experienced a 6-week waiting period, while the horse riding group began THR. The wait-list control group began riding after 6 weeks of participating in the control group. Demographic and health history information was obtained from all the participants. PTSD symptoms were measured using the standardized PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M). The PCL-M as well as other instruments including, The Coping Self Efficacy Scale (CSES), The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and The Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults-short version (SELSA) were used to access different aspects of individual well-being and the PTSD symptoms. Participants had a statistically significant decrease in PTSD scores after 3 weeks of THR (P ≤ 0.01) as well as a statistically and clinically significant decrease after 6 weeks of THR (P ≤ 0.01). Logistic regression showed that participants had a 66.7% likelihood of having lower PTSD scores at 3 weeks and 87.5% likelihood at 6 weeks. Under the generalized linear model(GLM), our ANOVA findings for the coping self-efficacy, emotion regulation, and social and emotional loneliness did not reach statistical significance. The results for coping self-efficacy and emotion regulation trended in the predicted direction. Results for emotional loneliness were opposite the predicted direction. Logistic regression provided validation that outcome effects were caused by riding longer. The findings suggest that THR may be a clinically effective intervention for alleviating PTSD symptoms in military veterans.",0,MNR,LS

Current theories suggest that rumination contributes to PTSD symptoms directly, by increasing negative reactions to trauma cues (i.e., symptom exacerbation), or represents a form of cognitive avoidance, if verbal ruminations are less distressing than trauma imagery. The goal of this study was to test the symptom exacerbation and cognitive avoidance accounts of trauma-focused rumination. We recruited 135 trauma-exposed participants (n = 60 diagnosed with PTSD) and randomly assigned them to ruminate about their trauma, distract themselves, or engage in trauma imagery. For individuals with and without PTSD, rumination led to larger increases in subjective distress (i.e., negative affect, fear, sadness, subjective arousal, valence) than distraction, ηp 2 s = .04-.13, but there were no differences between rumination and imagery ηp 2 s = .001-.02. We found no evidence that rumination or imagery elicited physiological arousal, ds = 0.01-0.19, but did find that distraction reduced general physiological arousal, as measured by heart rate, relative to baseline, d = 0.84, which may be due to increases in parasympathetic nervous system activity (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia), d = 0.33. These findings offer no support for the avoidant function of rumination in PTSD. Instead, the findings were consistent with symptom exacerbation, indicating that rumination leads directly to emotional reactivity to trauma reminders and may be a fruitful target in PTSD intervention.",0,MNR,LS

Participants (n = 503) were randomized to an immediate workbook (n = 256) or wait-list condition (n = 247). Nonparametric bootstrapped mediation analyses showed that pre-post positive changes in ACT treatment processes accounted for the relation between treatment and pre-post improvement on the primary outcomes of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Results indicated no baseline variables were significant moderators. Finally, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the degree of improvement for each primary outcome was positively correlated with the degree to which participants reported applying the workbook material to their day-to-day life, over and above how much of the book they reported reading.

They then completed one of four brief interventions that targeted these emotionally charged cognitions: analogue versions of CR and CD, and two control interventions. The personal negative cognitions were then reactivated to examine the protective effects of these interventions. CR and CD were similarly efficacious in alleviating distress, compared to a control intervention that focused on participants' negative thoughts. Mood improvement was associated with state levels of reappraisal and not with acceptance in CR, whereas the reverse was observed in CD. Improvement was associated with perceived efficacy of the intervention in CR but not in CD. The present findings suggest that although CR and CD effectively promote different types of cognitive strategies, they may share important features that set them both apart from maladaptive forms of coping.",0,MNR,LS

In the current study, we examined the longitudinal associations in a sample of 1726 among TTD, PIL, and drinking outcomes using data from Project MATCH (1997, 1998). Parallel process latent growth curve analyses indicated that PIL and TTD were significantly associated across time, such that higher initial levels of PIL and increases in PIL over time were associated with lower initial levels of TTD and decreases in TTD over time. Higher initial levels of TTD, lower initial levels of PIL, increases in TTD, and decreases in PIL were significantly associated with greater intensity and frequency of drinking and greater drinking-related consequences at the 15-month follow-up. Accordingly, TTD and PIL may be important constructs for clinicians to consider throughout the course of treatment. Future studies should examine if and how various kinds of treatments for AUDs are associated with increases in PIL, and whether these increases are related to decreased TTD and reduced drinking.",0,MNR,LS

The expectations of untreated patients and health professionals were examined by means of interviews and focus groups. There were 43 participants (20 patients with mild and moderate levels of depression, 11 primary care physicians, and 12 managers; 22 of them for interviews and 21 for groups). A thematic content analysis from the grounded theory for interviews, and an analysis of the discursive positions of participants based on the sociological model for groups were performed. Interpretations were achieved by agreement between three independent analysts. All participants showed a good general acceptance of Web-based psychotherapy, appreciating possible advantages and improvements. Patients, physicians, and managers shared the same conceptualization of their expectations, although highlighting different aspects. Patients focused on the need for individualized and personalized interaction, while professionals highlighted the need for the standardization of the program. Physicians were concerned with extra workload, while managers were worried about optimizing cost-effectiveness. Expectations of the different participants can conflict with each other.

We had two primary aims: reduce perceived vulnerability to injury among individual pedestrians and reduce distracted pedestrian behavior in the environment through a change in community-based norms. The hallmark of the behavioral intervention was a week-long opportunity for community members to experience personally the risks of distracted pedestrian behavior by attempting to cross a virtual pedestrian environment street while text-messaging. This was supplemented by traditional and social marketing and publicity through various campus partners. A sample of 219 individuals completed self-report surveys about perceived vulnerability to distracted pedestrian injury before experiencing the distracted virtual street-crossing and again after 2 weeks and 5 months. Observational assessment of distracted pedestrian behavior was conducted at a busy intersection on the campus as well as at a control campus not exposed to the intervention at baseline, post-intervention, 10 weeks, and 6 months.

SAAF is a 7-session family skills training program offered in community settings. To overcome limitations of a past trial that used intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses, a Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) analysis was used to estimate intervention effects and to determine the precise dosage of the intervention needed to achieve alcohol deterrence. A sample of 472 African American youth and their caregivers were recruited randomly from public schools in 7 rural Georgia counties. Families were assigned randomly to receive SAAF or a no-treatment control. Youth provided data on their alcohol use during the past 3 months at 4 home visits, the final occurring 34 months after baseline and 28 months after the intervention. Efficacy was tested with Poisson latent growth curve models. SAAF deterred growth in alcohol use in models using both ITT and CACE estimation. CACE analyses revealed that, among participants who received a full dose of the intervention (7 sessions), a large treatment effect on slowed growth in alcohol use emerged (β = -.83, p < .001). Dose-response analyses in CACE models revealed a medium-sized effect (d [95% CI] = 1.51 [1.25, 1.75]) when participants attended at least 5 of the 7 sessions offered.

The training increases trainees' self-perceived knowledge (regression-adjusted effect size [ES] = .38, p < .001), self-perceived ability to identify students in distress (ES = .19, p = .01), and confidence to help (ES = .17, p = .04). There are no apparent effects, however, on utilization of mental health care in the student communities in which the trainees live. Although GKT programs are widely used to increase access to mental health care, these programs may require modifications to achieve their objectives.",0,MNR,LS

Brain glutamate (Glu) signaling may contribute to OCD pathophysiology and moderate CBT outcomes. We assessed whether Glu measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was associated with OCD and/or CBT response. Youths aged 7-17 years with DSM-IV OCD and typically developing controls underwent 3 T proton echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (PEPSI) MRS scans of pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) and ventral posterior cingulate cortex (vPCC)-regions possibly affected by OCD-at baseline. Controls returned for re-scan after 8 weeks. OCD youth-in a randomized rater-blinded trial-were re-scanned after 12-14 weeks of CBT or after 8 weeks of minimal-contact waitlist; waitlist participants underwent a third scan after crossover to 12-14 weeks of CBT. Forty-nine children with OCD (mean age 12.2±2.9 years) and 29 controls (13.2±2.2 years) provided at least one MRS scan. At baseline, Glu did not differ significantly between OCD and controls in pACC or vPCC. Within controls, Glu was stable from scan-to-scan. Within OCD subjects, a treatment-by-scan interaction (p=0.034) was observed, driven by pACC Glu dropping 19.5% from scan-to-scan for patients randomized to CBT, with minor increases (3.8%) for waitlist participants. The combined OCD participants (CBT-only plus waitlist-CBT) also showed a 16.2% (p=0.004) post-CBT decrease in pACC Glu. In the combined OCD group, within vPCC, lower pre-CBT Glu predicted greater post-CBT improvement in symptoms (CY-BOCS; r=0.81, p=0.00025).

To address problems of treatment access and adherence, innovative adaptations of current interventions are needed. This randomized control trial investigated the relative efficacy of a novel format of parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), a treatment for young children with conduct problems. Eighty-one families with 3- to 6-year-old children (71.6% boys, 85.2% White) with diagnoses of oppositional defiant or conduct disorder were randomized to individual PCIT (n = 42) or the novel format, Group PCIT. Parents completed standardized measures of children's conduct problems, parenting stress, and social support at intake, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Therapist ratings, parent attendance, and homework completion provided measures of treatment adherence. Throughout treatment, parenting skills were assessed using the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System. Parents in both group and individual PCIT reported significant improvements from intake to posttreatment and follow-up in their children's conduct problems and adaptive functioning, as well as significant decreases in parenting stress. Parents in both treatment conditions also showed significant improvements in their parenting skills. There were no interactions between time and treatment format. Contrary to expectation, parents in Group PCIT did not experience greater social support or treatment adherence. Group PCIT was not inferior to individual PCIT and may be a valuable format to reach more families in need of services. Future work should explore the efficiency and sustainability of Group PCIT in community settings. (PsycINFO Database Record",0,MNR,LS

Little is known, however, about the mechanisms of change in treatment for patients with PTSD and co-occurring substance use disorders. The aim of the present study was to examine whether within- and between-session habituation of distress and substance craving during imaginal exposure relates to treatment outcomes among U.S. military veterans with PTSD and a co-occurring substance use disorder (N = 54). Veterans received Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorders Using Prolonged Exposure, a manualized integrated treatment combining prolonged exposure with cognitive-behavioral therapy for substance use disorders as part of a larger randomized clinical trial. Self-reported distress and craving ratings were collected during each imaginal exposure session. Data were analyzed using a series of random intercept and slope multilevel linear and generalized linear models. Results revealed that between-session habituation of distress and craving was associated with greater improvement in PTSD symptoms during treatment. Between-session habituation of craving was also associated with a marginally greater reduction in frequency of substance use among participants still reporting use during treatment. Within-session habituation of distress was unrelated to treatment outcome. Together, these findings indicate that habituation in both distress and craving may be important in maximizing treatment outcome for patients with PTSD and comorbid substance use disorders.

In a randomized trial sample, we assessed 3 SBIRT care modalities: (1) pediatrician-delivered, (2) behavioral clinician-delivered, and (3) usual. Medical comorbidity and health care use were compared between a brief-intervention group with access to SBIRT for behavioral health (combined pediatrician and behavioral clinician arms) and a group without (usual care) over 1 and 3 years.

Mind-body therapies such as hypnotherapy may offer additional treatment options for individuals with urgency urinary incontinence. To evaluate hypnotherapy's efficacy compared to medications in treating women with urgency urinary incontinence. This investigator-masked, noninferiority trial compared hypnotherapy to medications at an academic center in the southwestern United States, and randomized women with non-neurogenic urgency urinary incontinence to weekly hypnotherapy sessions for 2 months (and continued self-hypnosis thereafter) or to medication and weekly counseling for 2 months (and medication alone thereafter). The primary outcome was the between-group comparison of percent change in urgency incontinence on a 3-day bladder diary at 2 months. Important secondary outcomes were between-group comparisons of percent change in urgency incontinence at 6 and 12 months. Outcomes were analyzed based on noninferiority margins of 5% for between group differences (P < 0.025) (that is, for between group difference in percentage change in urgency incontinence, if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was greater than -5%, noninferiority would be proved). A total of 152 women were randomized to treatment between April 2013 and October 2016. Of these women, 142 (70 hypnotherapy, 72 medications) had 3-day diary information at 2 months and were included in the primary outcome analysis. Secondary outcomes were analyzed for women with diary data at the 6-month and then 12-month time points (138 women [67 hypnotherapy, 71 medications] at 6 months, 140 women [69 hypnotherapy, 71 medications] at 12 months. There were no differences between groups' urgency incontinence episodes at baseline: median (quartile 1, quartile 3) for hypnotherapy was 8 (4, 14) and medication was 7 (4, 11) (P = .165). For the primary outcome, although both interventions showed improvement, hypnotherapy did not prove noninferior to medication at 2 months. Hypnotherapy's median percent improvement was 73.0% (95% confidence interval, 60.0-88˖9%), whereas medication's improvement was 88.6% (95% confidence interval, 78.6-100.0%). The median difference in percent change between groups was 0% (95% confidence interval, -16.7% to 0.0%); because the lower margin of the confidence interval did not meet the predetermined noninferiority margin of greater than -5%, hypnotherapy did not prove noninferior to medication. In contrast, hypnotherapy was noninferior to medication for the secondary outcomes at 6 months (hypnotherapy, 85.7% improvement, 95% confidence interval, 75.0-100%; medications, 83.3% improvement, 95% confidence interval, 64.7-100%; median difference in percent change between groups of 0%, 95% confidence interval, 0.0-6.7%) and 12 months (hypnotherapy, 85.7% improvement, 95% confidence interval, 66.7-94.4%; medications, 80% improvement, 95% confidence interval, 54.5-100%; median difference in percent change between groups of 0%, 95% confidence interval, -4.2% to -9.5%).

A randomized controlled crossover design (n = 26) was used to examine the differential effects of students receiving performance feedback or general feedback on role-play interviews. Ethnographic principles, open-ended questions, and restating and summarizing comments were measured at 3 time points: after class instruction (Groups 1 and 2), after the first feedback type allocation (Group 1: performance feedback; Group 2: general feedback), and after the second feedback type allocation (Group 1: general feedback; Group 2: performance feedback). Statistically significant increases, with large effect sizes, were found in students' use of ethnographic principles, open-ended questions, and restating and summarizing comments following the performance feedback conditions.

We examined the influence of personality status on the 8-year outcome of health anxiety and its relationship to the effects of cognitive behaviour therapy in a randomized controlled trial. This study aims to examine both the usefulness of the diagnosis of personality disorder and an additional measure of pathological dependence, in predicting the outcome of medical patients with health anxiety treated with cognitive behaviour therapy. Because the influence of personality is often shown in the long term, these assessments covered the period of 8 years after randomization. An additional aim is to examine the costs of different levels of personality dysfunction in each treatment group. Personality dysfunction, using both ICD-10 and ICD-11 classifications of severity, was assessed at baseline by interview in a randomized controlled trial. Patients were also assessed for pathological dependence using the Dependent Personality Questionnaire, also scored along a severity dimension. Four hundred forty-four patients from medical clinics with pathological health anxiety were treated with a modified form of cognitive behaviour therapy for health anxiety (CBT-HA) or standard care. Total costs over follow-up were calculated from hospital data and compared by personality group. At baseline, 381 (86%) had some personality dysfunction, mainly at the lower level of personality difficulty (not formally a disorder). One hundred eighty four (41%) had a personality disorder. A similar proportion was found with regard to dependent personality. Using the ICD-10 classification, 153 patients (34.6%) had a personality disorder, with 83 (54.2%) having anxious or dependent personality disorder, 20 (13.1%) having an anankastic disorder, but also with 66 (43.1%) having mixed disorder. During initial treatment, those with personality disorder adhered more closely to CBT-HA, and after 8 years, they had a significantly better outcome than those with personality difficulty and no personality disorder (p < 0.002). Similar results were found in those scoring high on the Dependent Personality Questionnaire. All these differences increased over the follow-up period. Costs were similar in all groups but were somewhat higher in the CBT-HA one; this finding is hypothesised to be due to fuller hospital treatment once health anxiety is discounted. Personality disorder in people with health anxiety, particularly in those who have anxious and dependent traits, reinforces the benefits of cognitive behaviour therapy, particularly in the longer term. © 2020 The Authors Personality and Mental Health Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,MNR,LS

In Study 1, multilevel structural equation modeling utilizing diary data from 58 employees across 5 working days showed that daily challenge appraisal mediated the positive relationship between mindfulness and high-activation positive affect, and daily threat appraisal mediated the negative relationship between mindfulness and high-activation negative affect. In Study 2, 69 employees participated in a randomized control trial comparing self-directed mindfulness training with a wait-list control. Latent growth curve modeling demonstrated that the intervention produced a greater increase in daily mindfulness relative to the control condition. In turn, the rate of change in daily mindfulness influenced the change rate of appraisal, and daily appraisal influenced affect, as expected. Together, these studies indicate one way in which mindfulness may help employees to thrive at work is by adaptively shaping the stressor appraisal process, and that connecting mindfulness training to primary appraisal may bolster the potential beneficial effects in the work context.

To instill hope, legacy intervention aims to highlight past experiences while managing life stressors for a positive outlook. Participants take part in legacy activities-crafting tangible projects and recording one's life events-in order to actualize a personal sense of legacy. This pre-posttest research tested whether legacy intervention in a partial hospital program (PHP) on reframing past experiences through creative activities could increase life satisfaction and self-efficacy among adults with co-occurring substance misuse and mental health symptoms. Eighty consented patients with co-occurring disorders were randomly assigned to two groups with 62 participants continuing: 37 in legacy intervention (LI) and 25 in partial hospital program only (PHP-only). LI participants were engaged in both PHP and legacy activities. Ten group sessions were held over the course of five weeks for cohorts of 10-15 adult patients in each intervention. Sense of legacy was measured to ensure that LI patients received the appropriate legacy dosage. With RANOVA analyses between and among three time points, life satisfaction was significantly higher in the LI group with group interaction effect over time. In terms of self-efficacy, both groups showed positive changes but no significant difference could be found between the two groups over time and the interaction (time X group) effect was not significant. The legacy definitions gathered from the LI group were consistent with existing literature and showed three additional themes: children's involvement, concreteness, and life continuation after death.",0,MNR,LS

A randomized controlled trial was conducted with patients undergoing LLETZ performed under local anesthesia in an out patient setting at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, from February 2015 to January 2016. After informed consent and demographic data were obtained, we assessed the anxiety level using State Anxiety Inventory pre and post procedures. Music group patients listened to classical songs through headphones, while the control group received the standard care. Pain score was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS). Statistical analysis was conducted using Pearson Chi-square, Fisher's Exact test and T-Test and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A total of 73 patients were enrolled and randomized, resulting in 36 women in the music group and 37 women in the non-music control group. The preoperative mean anxiety score was higher in the music group (46.8 VS 45.8 points).

A Randomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA psychiatry,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0270,26107752,"Long-acting, injectable, second-generation antipsychotic medication has tremendous potential to bring clinical stability to persons with schizophrenia. However, long-acting medications are rarely used following a first episode of schizophrenia. To compare the clinical efficacy of the long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone with the oral formulation in the early course of schizophrenia. A randomized clinical trial performed at a university-based research clinic, between 2005 and 2012. Eighty-six patients with recent onset of schizophrenia were randomized to receive long-acting injectable risperidone or oral risperidone. Half of each group was simultaneously randomized to receive cognitive remediation to improve cognitive functioning or healthy-behaviors training to improve lifestyle habits and well-being. An intent-to-treat analysis was performed between October 4, 2012, and November 12, 2014. A 12-month trial comparing the long-acting injectable vs oral risperidone and cognitive remediation vs healthy-behaviors training. Psychotic relapse and control of breakthrough psychotic symptoms. Of the 86 patients randomized, 3 refused treatment in the long-acting injectable risperidone group. The psychotic exacerbation and/or relapse rate was lower for the long-acting risperidone group compared with the oral group (5% vs 33%; χ21 = 11.1; P < .001; relative risk reduction, 84.7%). Long-acting injectable risperidone better controlled mean levels of hallucinations and delusions throughout follow-up (β = -0.30; t68 = -2.6, P = .01). The cognitive remediation and healthy-behaviors training groups did not differ significantly regarding psychotic relapse, psychotic symptom control, or hospitalization rates, and there were no significant interactions between the 2 medications and the 2 psychosocial treatments. Discontinuations owing to inadequate clinical response were more common in the oral group than in the long-acting risperidone group (χ21 = 6.1; P = .01). Adherence to oral risperidone did not appear to differ before randomization but was better for the long-acting risperidone group compared with the oral group (t80 = 5.3; P < .001). Medication adherence was associated with prevention of exacerbation and/or relapse (χ21 =11.1; P = .003) and control of breakthrough psychotic symptoms (β = 0.2; t79 = 2.1; P = .04). The use of long-acting injectable risperidone after a first episode of schizophrenia has notable advantages for clinical outcomes. The key clinical advantages are apparently owing to the more consistent administration of the long-acting injectable. Such formulations should be offered earlier in the course of illness. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00333177.",0,MNR,LS

Current psychological pain treatments focus primarily on ameliorating negative affective processes, yet basic science suggests that risk for opioid misuse is linked with a dearth of positive affect. Interventions that modulate positive psychological processes may produce therapeutic benefits among patients with opioid-treated chronic pain. The aim of this study was to conduct a theory-driven mechanistic analysis of proximal outcome data from a Stage 2 randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), an integrative intervention designed to promote positive psychological health. Patients with opioid-treated chronic pain (N = 95; age = 56.8 ± 11.7; 66% female) were randomized to 8 weeks of therapist-led MORE or support group (SG) interventions. A latent positive psychological health variable comprised of positive affect, meaning in life, and self-transcendence measures was examined as a mediator of the effect of MORE on changes in pain severity at posttreatment and opioid misuse risk by 3-month follow-up. Participants in MORE reported significantly greater reductions in pain severity by posttreatment (p = .03) and opioid misuse risk by 3-month follow-up (p = .03) and significantly greater increases in positive psychological health (p < .001) than SG participants. Increases in positive psychological health mediated the effect of MORE on pain severity by posttreatment (p = .048), which in turn predicted decreases in opioid misuse risk by follow-up (p = .02). Targeting positive psychological mechanisms via MORE and other psychological interventions may reduce opioid misuse risk among chronic pain patients receiving long-term opioid therapy.

Few studies have examined whether interventions prior to deployment can improve mechanisms underlying resilience. Mindfulness-based techniques have been shown to aid recovery from stress and may affect brain-behavior relationships prior to deployment. The authors examined the effect of mindfulness training on resilience mechanisms in active-duty Marines preparing for deployment. Eight Marine infantry platoons (N=281) were randomly selected. Four platoons were assigned to receive mindfulness training (N=147) and four were assigned to a training-as-usual control condition (N=134). Platoons were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks after baseline, and during and after a stressful combat training session approximately 9 weeks after baseline. The mindfulness training condition was delivered in the form of 8 weeks of Mindfulness-Based Mind Fitness Training (MMFT), a program comprising 20 hours of classroom instruction plus daily homework exercises. MMFT emphasizes interoceptive awareness, attentional control, and tolerance of present-moment experiences. The main outcome measures were heart rate, breathing rate, plasma neuropeptide Y concentration, score on the Response to Stressful Experiences Scale, and brain activation as measured by functional MRI. Marines who received MMFT showed greater reactivity (heart rate [d=0.43]) and enhanced recovery (heart rate [d=0.67], breathing rate [d=0.93]) after stressful training; lower plasma neuropeptide Y concentration after stressful training (d=0.38); and attenuated blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in the right insula and anterior cingulate.

Errorful and errorless practice conditions are effective for different populations and tasks. Errorful learning provides opportunities for learners to make task-relevant choices. Enhancing learner autonomy through choice opportunities is a key component of the Optimizing Performance through Intrinsic Motivation and Attention for Learning (OPTIMAL) theory of motor learning. The objective of this study was to evaluate the interaction between error opportunity frequency and OPTIMAL (autonomy-supportive) practice conditions during stepping sequence acquisition in a virtual environment. Forty healthy young adults were randomized to autonomy-supportive or autonomy-controlling practice conditions, which differed in instructional language, focus of attention (external vs internal) and positive versus negative nature of verbal and visual feedback. All participants practiced 40 trials of 4, six-step stepping sequences in a random order. Each of the 4 sequences offered different amounts of choice opportunities about the next step via visual cue presentation (4 choices; 1 choice; gradually increasing [1-2-3-4] choices, and gradually decreasing [4-3-2-1] choices). Motivation and engagement were measured by the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) and the User Engagement Scale (UES). Participants returned 1-3 days later for retention tests, where learning was measured by time to complete each sequence. No choice cues were offered on retention. Participants in the autonomy-supportive group outperformed the autonomy-controlling group at retention on all sequences (mean difference 2.88s, p < .005, t[6835] = 3.42). Participants in both groups had the most difficulty acquiring the decreasing choice (4-3-2-1) sequence (p < .001, t[6835] = -4.26) and performed most poorly on the errorful (4 choice) sequence (p < .034, t[6835] = 2.65) at retention. Participants in the autonomy-supportive group performed best at retention on the increasing choice (1-2-3-4) sequence (p < .033, t[6835] = -2.7). Participants in both groups who reported greater attention to the task on the UES Average Focused Attention subscale during acquisition had poorer retention performance, particularly for the decreasing choice (4-3-2-1) sequence (p < .005, t(6835) = 3.39). Participants in the autonomy-supportive group reported significantly higher overall motivation (p = .007, t(38) = 0.728, d = 0.248) on the IMI as compared to the autonomy-controlling group. Individual benefits of errorless learning and autonomy-supportive practice conditions, with an interaction effect for practice that begins errorless but adds increasing error opportunities over time, suggest that participants relied on implicit learning strategies for this full body task and that feedback about successes minimized errors and reduced their potential information-processing benefits. Subsequent work will continue to examine how assigning a positive versus a negative quality to error provision influences the benefits of errorful learning in a variety of tasks.",0,MNR,LS

Using a randomized controlled trial with student-level random assignment within two public schools (School 1: n = 198 seventh-graders, 73% Black, 27% White, 53% male; School 2: n = 400 ninth-graders, 98% White, 2% Black, 52% male), this trial conceptually integrated elements from three evidence-based mindset interventions. It then examined two theoretically driven moderators of student performance following the transition to middle or high school: students' racial backgrounds and students' educational expectations. Results indicated that the intervention was effective for a particular subset of students-Black students with high educational expectations-resulting in higher grades over the course of the year. Among students with low educational expectations (regardless of race), the intervention did not impact grades. For White students with high educational expectations, the control activities actually benefitted grades more than the mindset intervention. Both theoretical and practical implications for mindset research are discussed.",0,MNR,LS

Help4Mood supports self-report and biometric monitoring and includes elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. We aimed to evaluate system use and acceptability, to explore likely recruitment and retention rates in a clinical trial and to obtain an estimate of potential treatment response with a view to conducting a future randomised controlled trial (RCT). We conducted a pilot RCT of Help4Mood in three centres, in Romania, Spain and Scotland, UK. Patients with diagnosed depression (major depressive disorder) and current mild/moderate depressive symptoms were randomised to use the system for four weeks in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. Twenty-seven individuals were randomised and follow-up data were obtained from 21 participants (12/13 Help4Mood, 9/14 TAU). Half of participants randomised to Help4Mood used it regularly (more than 10 times); none used it every day. Acceptability varied between users. Some valued the emotional responsiveness of the system, while others found it too repetitive. Intention to treat analysis showed a small difference in change of Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-2) scores (Help4Mood -5.7 points, TAU -4.2). Post-hoc on-treatment analysis suggested that participants who used Help4Mood regularly experienced a median change in BDI-2 of -8 points. Help4Mood is acceptable to some patients receiving treatment for depression although none used it as regularly as intended. Changes in depression symptoms in individuals who used the system regularly reached potentially meaningful levels.",0,MNR,LS

Randomized controlled trials of cognitive behavioral therapy for tinnitus have demonstrated its effectiveness in improving quality of life, but the effects of their implementation on a large scale in routine practice remains unknown. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to examine the effects of stepped-care cognitive behavioral therapy for tinnitus delivered in a tertiary audiological center of a regional hospital. Second, we wished to examine predictors of favorable outcome. Four hundred three adults with chronic tinnitus were enrolled in this prospective observational study (at 3 months, N=334, 8 months, N=261; 12 months, N=214). The primary outcome was health-related quality of life as measured by the Health Utilities Index III (HUI-III) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were self-reported levels of tinnitus-related distress, disability, affective distress and tinnitus-related negative beliefs and fear. Measures were completed pre-intervention at 3 months, 8 months, and 12 months. Multilevel modeling was used to examine effects and their predictors. Younger participants with lower levels of tinnitus distress were more likely to dropout while those with higher tinnitus distress at baseline and quality of life were more likely to receive step 2 of treatment. MLM analyses revealed, with one exception, no relation between any baseline variable and outcome change over time. Most participants' improvement exceeded minimally clinical important difference criteria for quality of life, tinnitus-related handicap, and tinnitus distress. Results from this large pragmatic study complements those from randomized controlled trials of cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic tinnitus distress and supports its implementation under ""real-world"" conditions.",0,MNR,LS

This study aims to determine the child pre-treatment variables and treatment outcomes associated with early and late alliance in cognitive behaviour therapy targeting emotion regulation for children with autism. Data were collected from 48 children with autism who participated in a larger randomized-controlled trial. Pre-treatment child characteristics included child, parent, and clinician report of child emotional and behavioural functioning. Primary outcome measures included child and parent-reported emotion regulation. Therapeutic alliance (bond and task-collaboration) was measured using observational coding of early and late therapy sessions. Pre-treatment levels of child-reported emotion inhibition were associated with subsequent early and late bond. Pre-treatment levels of parent and child-reported emotion regulation were related to early and late task-collaboration. Late task-collaboration was also associated with pre-treatment levels of behavioural and emotional symptom severity. Task-collaboration in later sessions predicted improvements in parent-reported emotion regulation from pre- to post-therapy.

Our goal was to identify predictors of good outcome during the 1-year follow-up in the Combined Pharmacotherapies and Behavioral Interventions for Alcohol Dependence (COMBINE) Study. We constructed classification trees and a deterministic forest to predict no heavy drinking days during the last 8 weeks of the 1-year follow-up in COMBINE, based on more than 100 baseline predictors and drinking outcomes during the treatment phase of the study. The COMBINE sample was randomly split into a training and a validation data set. Logistic regression models were fit to compare the predictive performance of tree-based methods and classical methods. A small tree with only two splits and four nodes based on abstinence and good clinical outcome during treatment had fair classification accuracy in the training and the validation samples: area under the curve (AUC) of 71% and 70%, respectively. Drinking outcomes during treatment were the strongest predictors in the deterministic forest. Logistic regression analyses based on four main effects (good clinical outcome, level of drinking during treatment, age at onset of alcohol dependence, and feeling more energetic) had slightly better classification accuracy (AUC = 74%). End-of-treatment outcomes were the strongest predictors of long-term outcome in all analyses. The results emphasize the importance of optimizing outcomes during treatment and identify potential subgroups of individuals who require additional or alternative interventions to achieve good long-term outcome.",0,MNR,LS

Participants were randomized to 24 weeks of naltrexone (NAL), NAL and prolonged exposure (PE), pill placebo, or pill placebo and PE. All participants received supportive AD counseling (the BRENDA manualized model). Logistic regression using the Fournier approach was conducted to investigate baseline predictors of dropout across the entire study sample. Rates of PTSD and AD symptom improvement were included to evaluate the impact of symptom change on dropout. Trauma type and rates of PTSD and AD improvement significantly predicted dropout, accounting for 76% of the variance in dropout. Accidents and ""other"" trauma were associated with the highest dropout, and physical assault was associated with the lowest dropout. For participants with low baseline PTSD severity, faster PTSD improvement predicted higher dropout. For those with high baseline severity, both very fast and very slow rates of PTSD improvement were associated with higher dropout. Faster rates of drinking improvement predicted higher dropout among participants who received PE. The current study highlights the influence of symptom trajectory on dropout risk. Clinicians may improve retention in PTSD-AD treatments by monitoring symptom change at regular intervals, and eliciting patient feedback on these changes.",0,MNR,LS

Multisite two-arm, parallel-group, pragmatic randomised controlled superiority trial. Community mental health services in three NHS trusts in England and Wales. Community-dwelling adults with any personality disorder recruited from community mental health services. Up to four individual sessions of psychoeducation, a collaborative dialogue about personality disorder, followed by 12 group sessions of problem-solving therapy to help participants learn a process for solving interpersonal problems. The primary outcome was measured by the Social Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ). Secondary outcomes were service use (general practitioner records), mood (measured via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and client-specified three main problems rated by severity. We studied the mechanism of change using the Social Problem-Solving Inventory. Costs were identified using the Client Service Receipt Inventory and quality of life was identified by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire. Research assistants blinded to treatment allocation collected follow-up information. There were 739 people referred for the trial and 444 were eligible. More adverse events in the PEPS arm led to a halt to recruitment after 306 people were randomised (90% of planned sample size); 154 participants received PEPS and 152 received usual treatment. The mean age was 38 years and 67% were women. Follow-up at 72 weeks after randomisation was completed for 62% of participants in the usual-treatment arm and 73% in the PEPS arm. Intention-to-treat analyses compared individuals as randomised, regardless of treatment received or availability of 72-week follow-up SFQ data. Median attendance at psychoeducation sessions was approximately 90% and for problem-solving sessions was approximately 50%. PEPS therapy plus usual treatment was no more effective than usual treatment alone for the primary outcome [adjusted difference in means for SFQ -0.73 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.83 to 0.38 points; p = 0.19], any of the secondary outcomes or social problem-solving. Over the follow-up, PEPS costs were, on average, £182 less than for usual treatment. It also resulted in 0.0148 more quality-adjusted life-years. Neither difference was statistically significant. At the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence thresholds, the intervention had a 64% likelihood of being the more cost-effective option. More adverse events, mainly incidents of self-harm, occurred in the PEPS arm, but the difference was not significant (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.64). There was possible bias in adverse event recording because of dependence on self-disclosure or reporting by the clinical team. Non-completion of problem-solving sessions and non-standardisation of usual treatment were limitations.

The project was successful in reducing the risk of fatal or non-fatal first recurrent cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy on self-rated stress, somatic anxiety, vital exhaustion and depression and to study the associations of these factors with the reduction in cardiovascular events. Methods A total of 362 patients were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care groups. The psychological outcomes were assessed five times during 24 months and analysed using linear mixed models. The mediating roles of the outcomes were analysed using joint modelling of the longitudinal and time to event data. Results The intervention had a positive effect on somatic anxiety ( p < 0.05), reflecting a beneficial development over time compared with the controls. Stress, vital exhaustion and depression did not differ between the groups over time. Mediator analysis suggested that somatic anxiety may have mediated the effect of treatment on cardiovascular events. Conclusions The intervention had a small positive effect on somatic anxiety, but did not affect stress, vital exhaustion or depression in patients with coronary heart disease. Somatic anxiety was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and might act as a partial mediator in the treatment effect on cardiovascular events. However, the mechanisms between the intervention and the protective cardiovascular outcome remain to be identified.",0,MNR,LS

Significant improvements were demonstrated in NDI and velocity with good effect sizes in intervention groups compared to control. No within-group changes were presented in the control group, compared to global improvements in intervention groups. Velocity significantly improved at both time points in both groups. NDI, VAS, EQ5D, TSK and accuracy significantly improved at both time points in VR and in laser at 3 months evaluation in all but TSK. GPE scores showed 74-84% of participants perceived improvement and/or were satisfied. Significant advantages to the VR group compared to laser were found in velocity, pain intensity, health status and accuracy at both time points. The results support home kinematic training using VR or laser for improving disability, neck pain and kinematics in the short and intermediate term with an advantage to the VR group. The results provide directions for future research, use and development. ACTRN12615000231549.",0,MNR,LS

Insomnia is one of the most common symptoms to persist after evidence-based PTSD treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of sleep disturbances in a sample of active duty military personnel before and after receiving therapy for PTSD in a clinical trial and to explore the associations of insomnia and nightmares with PTSD diagnosis after treatment. Sleep parameters were evaluated with the PTSD Checklist in 108 active duty U.S. Army soldiers who had completed at least one deployment in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and who participated in a randomized clinical trial comparing Group Cognitive Processing Therapy-Cognitive Only Version with Group Present-Centered Therapy. Insomnia was the most frequently reported symptom before and after treatment, with 92% reporting insomnia at baseline and 74%-80% reporting insomnia at follow-up. Nightmares were reported by 69% at baseline and by 49%-55% at follow-up. Among participants who no longer met criteria for PTSD following treatment, 57% continued to report insomnia, but only 13% continued to report nightmares. At baseline, 54% were taking sleep medications, but sleep medication use did not affect the overall results. Insomnia was found to be one of the most prevalent and persistent problems among service members receiving PTSD treatment. Nightmares were relatively more positively responsive to treatment. For some service members with PTSD, the addition of specific treatments targeting insomnia and/or nightmares may be indicated. (PsycINFO Database Record",0,MNR,LS

We examined the feasibility and acceptability of a brief intervention called Self-concept and Engagement in LiFe (SELF) that aims to reduce engulfment and enhance personal recovery. Forty individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were assigned to SELF intervention or waitlist-control (treatment-as-usual). Outcome measures included the Modified Engulfment Scale and measures of depressive symptomatology, self-esteem, recovery style, quality of life, and self-stigma. Retention at post-therapy was 90% (18/20 completed SELF; 18/20 remained on waitlist). Eleven waitlist participants then completed SELF (73% overall retention). Participants reported high satisfaction with the intervention, and participation was associated with reduced engulfment (ES = 0.48), more adaptive recovery style (ES = 0.37), improved self-esteem (ES = 0.35), and reduced self-stigma (ES = 0.25). The treatment group had lower engulfment (adjusted mean = 91.9) compared to waitlist (adjusted mean = 100.0) post-therapy, F (1,32) = 5.78, p = .02, partial η2 = 0.15.

The high prevalence, comparatively mild symptom impairment, and transient nature make AjD a promising target for low-threshold self-help interventions. Bibliotherapy represents a potential treatment for AjD problems. This study investigates the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral self-help manual specifically directed at alleviating AjD symptoms in a homogenous sample of burglary victims. Participants with clinical or subclinical AjD symptoms following experience of burglary were randomized to an intervention group (n = 30) or waiting-list control group (n = 24). The new explicit stress response syndrome model for diagnosing AjD was applied. Participants received no therapist support and assessments took place at baseline, after the one-month intervention, and at three-month follow-up. Based on completer analyses, group by time interactions indicated that the intervention group showed more improvement in AjD symptoms of preoccupation and in post-traumatic stress symptoms. Post-intervention between-group effect sizes ranged from Cohen's d = .17 to .67 and the proportion of participants showing reliable change was consistently higher in the intervention group than in the control group. Engagement with the self-help manual was high: 87% of participants had worked through at least half the manual. This is the first published RCT of a bibliotherapeutic self-help intervention for AjD problems. The findings provide evidence that a low-threshold self-help intervention without therapist contact is a feasible and effective treatment for symptoms of AjD.",0,MNR,LS

Quitting tobacco may be beneficial for those seeking to quit cannabis use. This initial proof of concept, controlled trial was designed to compare a simultaneous versus sequential tobacco intervention among those seeking treatment for CUD. Sixty-seven adults received either a simultaneous (SIM) or sequential (SEQ) approach to tobacco cessation in the context of outpatient treatment for CUD. A tobacco intervention (TI) that combined web-based counseling with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was provided during weeks 1-12 for SIM and was delayed until weeks 13-24 for SEQ. During weeks 1-12, no between-condition significant differences were observed on treatment participation or cannabis use outcomes. The majority of SIM participants initiated TI counseling (62%), 50% made at least one quit attempt and 41% initiated NRT. Interestingly, 39% in SEQ made tobacco quit attempts and 18% initiated NRT on their own before the TI was offered to them. However, only 30% of those in SEQ continued treatment during weeks 13-24, which compromised between-condition comparisons following the TI, but illustrated a potential clinical concern with delaying the TI. Tobacco cessation outcomes generally were poor and did not differ between conditions. This initial controlled trial suggests that addressing tobacco use during CUD treatment is acceptable and generates action towards tobacco cessation. Additional trials testing more intensive TI models may be necessary to identify more efficacious interventions for co-use of cannabis and tobacco.",0,MNR,LS

Participants were recruited from the Waitlist Control Group of a large randomized controlled trial and provided access to the Pain Course over 8 weeks, with the addition of SMS prompts. Fifteen SMS prompts were created to encourage the use of self-management skills during the course. Participants were sent one random SMS prompt each business day. The acceptability of the SMS was assessed and clinical outcomes of participants who received prompts (n = 56) compared with a historical group who previously received the course without prompts (n = 139). SMS prompts were rated highly with 85% reporting them to be very helpful or helpful and that they would recommend them to others.

The aim was to assess the clinical effectiveness of Phobias Under Control, an Internet-based intervention based on exposure therapy with weekly guidance. We conducted a randomized controlled trial, recruiting 212 outpatients scheduled to receive face-to-face psychotherapy for any type of phobia at an outpatient clinic. Participants suffering from at least 1 DSM-IV or ICD-10 classified phobia (social phobia, agoraphobia with or without panic disorder, and/or specific phobia as ascertained by a telephone interview at baseline) were randomly allocated to either a 5-week Internet-based guided self-help program based on exposure therapy with weekly student support followed by face-to-face psychotherapy (n=105) or a wait-list control group followed by face-to-face psychotherapy (n=107). Primary outcome was the Fear Questionnaire (FQ). Secondary outcomes were the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). Assessments took place by telephone at baseline (T0) and on the Internet at posttest (T1, self-assessment at 5 weeks after baseline). Missing data at T1 were imputed. At posttest, analysis of covariance on the intention-to-treat sample showed significant but small effect sizes between intervention and control groups on the FQ (d=0.35, P=.02), CES-D (d=0.34, P=.03), and a nonsignificant effect size on the BAI (d=0.28.

Participants (n = 2570) were a subsample of those enrolled in a smoking cessation trial comparing two web-delivered intervention approaches: acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive behavioral therapy. Those included in this analysis self-reported having BD (n = 221), other ADs (n = 783) or no major MHCs (n = 1566). Surveys assessed baseline characteristics and self-reported abstinence at 3, 6, and 12-months post-randomization. Treatment utilization was tracked via page views. Smokers with BD were distinct from both AD and no MHC smokers on the majority of baseline characteristics. At 12-months, quit rates were lower for smokers with BD (20%) than no MHCs (29%; p = 0.01), but no different than other ADs (20%; p =  .467). Interactions between treatment assignment and diagnostic group were non-significant for cessation outcome. The number of logins was higher for smokers with BD than AD in the ACT arm only (p = .001), but this finding was not replicated across other utilization indicators. Smokers with BD and other ADs had similar long-term quit rates despite numerous differences in baseline characteristics. Despite being lower than for smokers without MHCs, long-term quit rates from web-based treatment are promising for smokers with BD as well as other ADs.",0,MNR,LS

When patients have specific deficits in cognitive control functions (CCD), they are not only distressing and debilitating, they often predict poor clinical outcomes such as reduced response to SSRI/SNRI antidepressants, increased disability, suicide and all-cause mortality. We recently reported that in an open label trial, our treatment designed to target these specific CCD with neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive remediation (nCCR) improved depression and CCD in patients who failed to remit with conventional antidepressant treatment. This study tested the hypothesis that in patients with LLD who have failed at least one trial of an SSRI/SNRI antidepressant at an adequate dose for at least 8 weeks, nCCR will improve both depressive symptoms and the CCD associated with poor antidepressant response (i.e. semantic strategy, inhibition of prepotent responses) more than an active control group. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either 30 hours/ 4 weeks of neuroplasticity based computerized cognitive remediation (nCCR) designed to target CCD, or the active control condition matched for duration, engagement, reward, computer presentation, and contact with study staff.

A significant difference was observed in post-training gains for the single stance (10.32 SD 4.14 vs. 6.54 SD 3.23), step length (8.47 SD 4.12 vs. 4.83 SD 2.14), and stride length (17.03 SD 6.57 vs 10.54 SD 4.34) between the experimental group and the control group (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between two groups on stance phase, swing phase, velocity, cadence, and step width (P > 0.05). We conclude that mirror therapy may be beneficial in improving the effects of stroke on gait ability.",0,MNR,LS

Although its efficacy is well established, the neural mechanisms underlying this intervention are unknown. This pilot study used functional MRI (fMRI) to explore neural changes following UFOVt. Task-driven and resting-state fMRI were used to examine changes in brain activity and connectivity in healthy older adults randomized to 10 hr of UFOVt (n = 13), 10 hr of cognitively stimulating activities (CSA; n = 11), or a no-contact control (NC; n = 10). UFOVt resulted in reduced task-driven activity in the majority of regions of interest (ROIs) associated with task performance, CSA resulted in reduced activity in one ROI, and there were no changes within the NC group. Relative to NC, UFOVt reduced activity in ROIs involved in effortful information processing. There were no other significant between-group task-based differences. Resting-state functional connectivity between ROIs involved in executive function and visual attention was strengthened following UFOVt compared with CSA and NC. UFOVt enhances connections needed for visual attention. Together with prior work, this study provides evidence that improvement of the brain's visual attention efficiency is one mechanism underlying UFOVt.",0,MNR,LS

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of PPI on the psychological capital, psychological distress, and life satisfaction among colostomy patients. Patients (n = 120) with permanent stomas were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups. Patients in the experimental group (n = 60) received standard care and PPI, whereas patients in the control group (n = 60) only received standard care. The psychological capital, psychological distress, and life satisfaction were measured and compared between two groups before the intervention, the immediate post-intervention, and follow-up. All 120 patients completed the study. The hope, optimism, resilience, psychological distress, and life satisfaction score of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group at T1 and T2 (P < 0.05). Self-efficacy score of the experimental group had no significant difference at the two time points after the intervention than the control group (P > 0.05).

Whilst mindfulness is traditionally taught in person, consumers are increasingly turning to mindfulness-based smartphone apps as an alternative delivery medium for training. Despite this growing trend, few studies have explored whether mindfulness delivered via a smartphone app can enhance psychosocial well-being within the general public. The present pilot randomised controlled trial compared the impact of engaging with the self-guided mindfulness meditation (MM) app 'Headspace' (n = 38) for a period of 10 or 30 days, to a wait-list (WL) control (n = 36), using a cohort of adults from the general population. The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Wagnild Resilience Scale were administered online at baseline and after 10 and 30 days of the intervention. Twelve participants (MM n = 9, WL n = 3) were lost to follow-up for unknown reasons. Relative to the WL control, the MM app positively impacted self-reported satisfaction with life, stress, and resilience at day 10, with further improvements emerging at day 30 (Cohen's d = 0.57, 1.42, 0.63 respectively). The rate of improvement was largest at the 10-day assessment point, dropping moderately by day 30. Participants that rated the MM app as easy to engage with experienced the largest self-reported benefits. Moreover, the MM app was able to protect against an unexpected increase in perceived stress that emerged in the control group. This pilot randomised controlled trial shows that self-reported improvements in psychosocial outcomes can be achieved at low cost through short-term engagement with a mindfulness-based smartphone app, and should be followed up with more substantive studies.

Cross-sectional studies indicate that PBS use may be particularly useful for students with mental health challenges; however, it is unclear whether training these students to use PBS is an effective approach for reducing alcohol use and consequences. The current study evaluated the efficacy of a standalone PBS skills training and personalized feedback (PBS-STPF) intervention among students accessing mental health services. Participants (N = 251) were randomly assigned to either an individual facilitator-led PBS-STPF intervention or a health-related control condition. Participants completed online follow-up surveys 1 and 6 months post-intervention which included measures of alcohol use, negative consequences, and a composite measure of PBS use. Relative to control participants, students in the PBS-STPF condition reported significantly greater PBS use but no differences in alcohol use or consequences. Participants in both conditions reported decreases in drinking outcomes over time. Tests of mediation indicated that the intervention indirectly led to reduction in drinking outcomes at 6 months through increased PBS use. Although the intervention resulted in changes in PBS use that were maintained for up to 6 months post-intervention, the effects of the intervention on drinking and consequences were limited. A brief standalone PBS training may need augmentation in order to promote effective use of PBS for substantial decreases in alcohol consequences.",0,MNR,LS

Journal of Family Psychology, 26(4), 565-575, 2012; Johnston et al. 2016). Building on prior research, we tested a mediational model hypothesizing that Family Check-Up (FCU) intervention effects on young adult risk would be mediated by increases in self-regulation, and that these changes would continue to affect risk behavior as high school youths transitioned to young adulthood. We also predicted that the intent-to-treat intervention would be associated with lower levels of risk in young adulthood and that this effect would be accounted for by intervention-induced improvements in self-regulation during early adolescence, which in turn would prevent young adult risk. Participants were 593 adolescents and their families recruited from three public middle schools and randomized either to the FCU or to a control group. Item response theory was applied to construct a measure of high-risk behavior at this age, including risk behaviors such as substance abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, and vocational risk. Results suggested that changes in children's self-regulation that occurred early during the middle school years, and that were associated with the FCU, led to reductions in risk behaviors during young adulthood. This study builds on our prior research that has suggested that effects of the FCU during middle school lead to changes in a range of risk behaviors during the transition to high school (Fosco et al.

Obesity frequently co-occurs with chronic health conditions, yet its impact on response to psychological interventions in this population is not known. The current study examined associations between BMI and clinical outcomes (depression, anxiety, disability, and satisfaction with life) following a transdiagnostic iCBT program targeting adjustment to chronic illness. Participants from a large randomised controlled trial, who provided information on height and weight, were included (N = 234; mean age= 48.32, SD = 13.80; mean BMI = 30.43, SD = 8.30, range 16.18-67.52; 86.8% female). The influence of baseline BMI range on treatment outcomes at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up was examined using generalized estimating equations. We also examined changes in BMI and in participants' perceived impact of weight on their health. Improvement in all outcomes occurred across BMI ranges; additionally, persons with obesity or overweight generally experienced greater symptom reductions than those within a healthy weight range. A greater proportion of participants with obesity achieved clinically significant change on key outcomes (e.g., depression: 32% [95% CI: 25%, 39%]) than participants with a healthy weight (21% [95% CI: 15%, 26%]) or overweight (24% [95% CI: 18%, 29%], p = 0.016). There were no significant changes in BMI from pre-treatment to 3-month follow-up, however there were significant reductions on the self-rated impact of weight on health. Persons with chronic health conditions and with obesity or overweight benefit at least as much as those with a healthy BMI from iCBT programs targeting psychological adjustment to chronic illness, even without changes in BMI. iCBT programs may be an important component in the self-management of this population, and may address barriers implicated in health behaviour change.",0,MNR,LS

The impact of PPD exposure on infant emotion regulation (ER) may be particularly harmful given its associations with later psychiatric problems. It remains unclear if treating maternal PPD can improve infant ER. To examine the impact of a nine-week peer-delivered group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention on infant ER assessed across physiological and behavioral levels. Seventy-three mother-infant dyads were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial from 2018 to 2020. Mothers/birthing parents were randomized to the experimental group or waitlist control group. Measures of infant ER were collected at baseline (T1) and nine weeks later (T2). Infant ER was assessed using two physiological measures (frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) and High Frequency-Heart Rate Variability (HF-HRV)), and parental-report of infant temperament. Experimental group infants displayed more adaptive changes in both physiological markers of infant ER from T1 to T2 (FAA (F(1,56) = 4.16, p = .046) and HF-HRV (F(1,28.1) = 5.57, p = .03)) than those in the waitlist control group. Despite improvements in maternal PPD, no differences were noted in infant temperament from T1 to T2. A limited sample size, potential lack of generalizability of our results to other populations, and an absence of long-term data collection. A scalable intervention designed for those with PPD may be capable of adaptively improving infant ER. Replication in larger samples is needed to determine if maternal treatment can help disrupt the transmission of psychiatric risk from mothers/birthing parents to their infants.",0,MNR,LS

Eighty adults with BN symptoms were randomized to 21 sessions of integrative cognitive-affective therapy (ICAT) or enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-E). Bulimic symptoms (i.e., frequency of binge eating and purging) were assessed at each session and posttreatment. Therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory) was assessed at Sessions 2, 8, 14, and posttreatment. Repeated-measures analyses using linear mixed models with random intercepts were conducted to determine differences in alliance growth by treatment and patient characteristics. Mixed-effects models examined the relation between alliance and symptom improvement. Overall, patients in both treatments reported strong therapeutic alliances. Regardless of treatment, greater therapeutic alliance between (but not within) subjects predicted greater reductions in bulimic behavior; reductions in bulimic behavior also predicted improved alliance. Patients with higher depression, anxiety, or emotion dysregulation had a stronger therapeutic alliance in CBT-E than ICAT, while those with more intimacy problems had greater improvement in therapeutic alliance in ICAT compared to CBT-E. Therapeutic alliance has a unique impact on outcome, independent of the impact of symptom improvement on alliance. Within- and between-subjects effects revealed that changes in alliance over time did not predict symptom improvement, but rather that individuals who had a stronger alliance overall had better bulimic symptom outcomes. These findings indicate that therapeutic alliance is an important predictor of outcome in the treatment of BN.",0,MNR,LS

To protect against these untoward postsurgical outcomes, TJA patients need better, non-pharmacological pain management strategies. This study compared two, promising, mindfulness-based pain management techniques. We conducted a single-site, three-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled study conducted at an orthopedic clinic among patients undergoing TJA of the knee or hip. TJA patients (N = 118, M age = 65, female = 73, Caucasian = 110) were randomized to either a preoperative mindfulness of breath (MoB), mindfulness of pain (MoP), or cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation (CB) intervention, approximately 3 weeks before surgery. Each intervention was delivered in a single, 20-min session during a 2-hr, preoperative education program. Change in pain intensity was the sole preoperative outcome. The postoperative outcomes, pain intensity, pain interference, and opioid use were assessed on the 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th postoperative days. MoB was found to most effectively decrease preoperative pain scores, F(2, 89) = 5.28, p = .007, while MoP resulted in the least amount of postoperative pain intensity, F(8, 94) = 3.21, p = .003, and interference, F(8, 94) = 2.52, p = .016). Both MoB and MoP decreased postoperative opioid use relative to CB, F(8, 83) = 16.66, p < .001. A brief preoperative MBI may be able to prevent both postoperative pain and opioid use. Moreover, the MBIs used in this study are highly feasible, capable of being delivered by nearly any healthcare provider, and requiring minimal clinic time given their brevity. As such, embedding MBIs in surgical care pathways has considerable potential. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).",0,MNR,LS
