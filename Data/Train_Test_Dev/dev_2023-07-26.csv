"Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are impaired in social adaptation and display deficits in social competence. Deficient emotion recognition has been discussed to underlie these social problems. However, comorbid conduct problems have not been considered in the majority of studies conducted so far, and the influence of medication on emotion recognition has rarely been studied. Here, emotion recognition performance was assessed in children with ADHD without medication compared with children with ADHD under stimulant medication and a matched control group. In order to rule out confounding by externalizing symptoms, children with comorbid conduct problems were excluded. Video clips with neutral faces developing a basic emotion (happiness, sadness, disgust, fear and anger) were presented in order to assess emotion recognition. Results indicated between-group differences neither concerning the number of correctly identified emotions nor concerning reaction times and their standard deviations. Thus, we suggest that ADHD per se is not associated with deficits in emotion recognition.",0
"BACKGROUND: Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (TVNS) is a promising treatment for acute and chronic pain. However, experimental studies yielded controversial results. We examined if TVNS reduces the perceived intensity of repetitive painful heat stimulation and temporal summation of pain (TSP) in healthy volunteers in comparison with placebo and sham stimulation, as well as no intervention. METHODS: In 4 sessions, 90 heat pulse stimuli at individual pain tolerance temperature were applied to the ventral forearm of 49 healthy volunteers (25 women) using a Contact Heat Evoked Potential Stimulator thermode (Medoc, Ramat Yishai, Israel). Pain intensity was assessed with verbal ratings on a numeric pain scale (0-100) at every tenth heat pulse. After the first session in which pain intensities without intervention were evaluated, participants completed 3 sessions in a single-blinded randomized crossover manner: (1) sham stimulation applied at the earlobes, (2) placebo stimulation (inactive device), or (3) TVNS applied at the cymbas conchae. Primary data were analyzed using analysis of variance for repeated measures and t test for paired samples. RESULTS: Pain intensity decreased during all interventions as compared to no intervention (etap = 0.22, P < .001; mean difference TVNS versus no intervention 9.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-15.4; P < .001). Hypoalgesic effect of TVNS was better than that of placebo and sham in men before the onset of TSP (mean differences for TVNS versus placebo 6.2; 95% CI, 0.2-12.1; TVNS versus sham 6.2; 95% CI, 0.2-12.1; P < .05). In women, TSP response under TVNS was decreased if compared to no intervention (median difference, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.5-15.0; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: TVNS, placebo, and sham stimulation exerted comparable effects under experimental heat pain stimulation. Only in male participants, TVNS was superior to sham and placebo conditions in the reduction of heat pain before the onset of TSP.",1
"The number line estimation task is an often-used measure of numerical magnitude understanding. The task also correlates substantially with broader measures of mathematical achievement. This raises the question of whether the task would be a useful component of mathematical achievement tests and instruments to diagnose dyscalculia or mathematical giftedness and whether a stand-alone version of the task can serve as a short screener for mathematical achievement. Previous studies on the relation between number line estimation accuracy and broader mathematical achievement were limited in that they used relatively small nonrepresentative samples and usually did not account for potentially confounding variables. To close this research gap, we report findings from a population-level study with nearly all Luxembourgish ninth-graders (N = 6484). We used multilevel regressions to test how a standardized mathematical achievement test relates to the accuracy in number line estimation on bounded number lines with whole numbers and fractions. We also investigated how these relations were moderated by classroom characteristics, person characteristics, and trial characteristics. Mathematical achievement and number line estimation accuracy were associated even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Subpopulations of students showed meaningful differences in estimation accuracy, which can serve as benchmarks in future studies. Compared with the number line estimation task with whole numbers, the number line estimation task with fractions was more strongly related to mathematical achievement in students across the entire mathematical achievement spectrum. These results show that the number line estimation task is a valid and useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring mathematical achievement.",1
"Previous research has documented altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity to laboratory-based social stress tasks in children with social anxiety disorder (SAD). It is unclear, however, whether these alterations are caused by the unfamiliar and possibly threatening lab environment or whether they generalize to other, more representative contexts. Sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic functioning was assessed in the home (minimizing environmental threat) during a supine baseline phase and two physical activation phases (orthostatic stress, stair stepping) in children (9-13 years) with SAD (n = 27) and healthy control children (n = 27). Relative to controls, children with SAD showed tonic autonomic hyperarousal as indicated by higher heart rate and electrodermal activity during the supine baseline phase. Further, there was evidence for stronger cardiac and vascular sympathetic reactivity (T-wave amplitude, pulse wave transit time) to moderate physical activation in children with SAD. Higher autonomic arousal during rest was related to measures of trait social anxiety and general psychopathology. Groups did not differ on parasympathetic parameters. Our results extend previous laboratory findings and provide the first evidence for alterations in children with SAD during basal autonomic regulation and in the absence of explicit social evaluative threat. They may further help to clarify conflicting study results from previous laboratory studies. The findings underline the importance of psychophysiological assessment using different environments and tasks to elucidate the physiological bases of SAD.",0
"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological research on post-stroke affective disorders has been mainly focusing on post-stroke depression (PSD). In contrast, research on post-stroke anxiety (PSA) is in its early stages. The present study proposes a broad picture on post-stroke affective disorders, including PSD and PSA in German stroke in-patients during rehabilitation. In addition, we investigated whether lifetime affective disorders predict the emergence of PSD and PSA. METHODS: 289 stroke patients were assessed in the early weeks following stroke for a range of mood and anxiety disorders by means of the Structured Clinical Interview relying on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV. This assessment was conducted for two periods: for post-stroke and retroactively for the period preceding stroke (lifetime). The covariation between PSD and PSA was investigated using Spearman-rho correlation. Predictors of PSD and PSA prevalence based on the respective lifetime prevalence were investigated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: PSD prevalence was 31.1%, PSA prevalence was 20.4%. We also found significant correlations between depression and anxiety at post-stroke and for the lifetime period. Interestingly, lifetime depression could not predict the emergence of PSD. In contrast, lifetime anxiety was a good predictor of PSA. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to highlight the complexity of post-stroke affective disorders by strengthening the comorbidity of depression and anxiety. In addition, we contrasted the predictability of PSA based on its lifetime history compared to PSD which was not predictable based on lifetime depression.",0
"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the relation between anxiety disorders in the postpartum period and cognitive as well as language development in infancy. AIMS: This longitudinal study investigated whether anxiety disorder in the postpartum period is linked to infant development at twelve months. A closer look was also taken at a possible link between maternal interaction and infant development. STUDY DESIGN: Subjects were videotaped during a Face-to-Face-Still-Face interaction with their infant (M = 4.0 months). Specific maternal anxiety symptoms were measured by self-report questionnaires (Anxiety Cognition Questionnaire (ACQ), Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ), Mobility Inventory (MI)) to check for a connection with infant development. The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III) were used to assess infant language and cognitive development at one year of age. SUBJECTS: n = 34 mothers with anxiety disorder (SCID-I; DSM-IV) and n = 47 healthy mothers with their infant. OUTCOME MEASURES: Infant performance on Bayley-III language and cognitive scales. RESULTS: Infants of mothers with anxiety disorder yielded significantly lower language scores than infants of controls. No significant group differences were found regarding infant cognitive development. Exploratory analyses revealed the vital role of ""maternal avoidance accompanied"" in infant language and cognitive development. Maternal neutral engagement, which lacks positive affect and vocalisations, turned out as the strongest negative predictor of cognitive development. Maternal anxiety cognitions and joint activity in mother-infant interaction were the strongest predictors of infant language performance. CONCLUSIONS: Results underline the importance to also consider the interaction behaviour of women with anxiety disorders to prevent adverse infant development.",0
"Internal signals like one's heartbeats are centrally processed via specific pathways and both their neural representations as well as their conscious perception (interoception) provide key information for many cognitive processes. Recent empirical findings propose that neural processes in the insular cortex, which are related to bodily signals, might constitute a neurophysiological mechanism for the encoding of duration. Nevertheless, the exact nature of such a proposed relationship remains unclear. We aimed to address this question by searching for the effects of cardiac rhythm on time perception by the use of a duration reproduction paradigm. Time intervals used were of 0.5, 2, 3, 7, 10, 14, 25, and 40 s length. In a framework of synchronization hypothesis, measures of phase locking between the cardiac cycle and start/stop signals of the reproduction task were calculated to quantify this relationship. The main result is that marginally significant synchronization indices (SIs) between the heart cycle and the time reproduction responses for the time intervals of 2, 3, 10, 14, and 25 s length were obtained, while results were not significant for durations of 0.5, 7, and 40 s length. On the single participant level, several subjects exhibited some synchrony between the heart cycle and the time reproduction responses, most pronounced for the time interval of 25 s (8 out of 23 participants for 20% quantile). Better time reproduction accuracy was not related with larger degree of phase locking, but with greater vagal control of the heart. A higher interoceptive sensitivity (IS) was associated with a higher synchronization index (SI) for the 2 s time interval only. We conclude that information obtained from the cardiac cycle is relevant for the encoding and reproduction of time in the time span of 2-25 s. Sympathovagal tone as well as interoceptive processes mediate the accuracy of time estimation.",0
"BACKGROUND: Difficulties in the ability to adapt beliefs in the face of new information are associated with psychosis and its central symptom - paranoia. As cognitive processes and psychotic symptoms are both known to be sensitive to stress, the present study investigated the exact associations between stress, adapting of beliefs [reversal learning (RL), bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), and jumping to conclusions (JTC)] and paranoia. We hypothesized that paranoia would increase under stress and that difficulties in adapting of beliefs would mediate or moderate the link between stress and paranoia. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the investigated effects would be strongest in the group of individuals diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. METHODS: We exposed 155 participants (38 diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, 40 individuals with attenuated psychotic symptoms, 39 clinical controls diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 38 healthy controls) to a control condition and a stress condition, in which we assessed their levels of paranoia and their ability to adapt beliefs. We applied multilevel models to analyze the data. RESULTS: Paranoia was higher in the stress condition than in the control condition, b = 1.142, s.e. = 0.338, t(150) = 3.381, p < 0.001. RL, BADE, and JTC did not differ between conditions and did not mediate or moderate the association between stress and paranoia (all ps > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the assumption that stress triggers paranoia. However, the link between stress and paranoia does not seem to be affected by the ability to adapt beliefs.",0
"Narcissism is characterized by a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, beauty, and similar values, which has been discussed as intra-individual regulation of a grandiose, but vulnerable self-concept. To explore where the narcissistic mind wanders, we used an experience-sampling approach in a sample with large variability in pathological narcissism inventory scores. Multilevel modeling revealed (1) more mind-wandering in participants with higher levels of narcissism and (2) a difference in the content of these thoughts (more self- and other-related, past and future oriented, negative content). Critically, (3) in high levels of narcissism, the self-related thoughts were associated with more positive valence and were also more future oriented. The results demonstrate the validity of the assumed grandiose, self-absorbed view of oneself in narcissism, which includes self-indulgent fantasies of future success. We also found additional evidence for negative, past-oriented thoughts in narcissism, a dysfunctional pattern reminiscent of rumination, possibly linked to increased psychopathological vulnerability in narcissism.",1
"OBJECTIVES: The objective was to investigate the pragmatic effectiveness of face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (F2F-CBT) for family caregivers of people with dementia (PwD) implemented in a routine care setting relative to usual care in a quasi-experimental study. METHODS: Participants indicating that attendance of F2F-CBT was possible were assigned to F2F-CBT (n = 49). F2F-CBT consisted of 12 sessions over 6 months. Effects were evaluated at posttest and 6-month follow-up on a variety of outcomes relative to usual care (CG; n = 134). RESULTS: At posttest, F2F-CBT yielded significantly fewer symptoms of depression (d = 0.37), better emotional well-being (d = 0.64), and better coping with the care situation (d = 0.52) than CG. At 6-month follow-up, the effect on emotional well-being was retained (d = 0.44) and social relationships were rated significantly better in F2F-CBT than CG (d = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: F2F-CBT proved to be effective in supporting family caregivers of PwD. However, only relatively few caregivers were able to regularly attend face-to-face sessions. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: CBT seems particularly suitable for supporting family caregivers of PwD in coping with the complex psychological burden. Delivery via telephone or internet could be a necessary alternative to F2F-CBT for reducing barriers to participation.",1
"BACKGROUND: Culturally adapted CBT (CA CBT) is a well-evaluated, culture-sensitive intervention for refugees that utilizes psychoeducation, problem solving training, meditation, and stretching exercises. However, there is a lack of standard procedures for adapting psychotherapeutic interventions to a specific cultural context. Our working group adapted CA CBT for Afghan refugees at two different stages, which yielded promising results from a pilot trial and an RCT with a waitlist control group. This article aimed to illustrate the ongoing adaptation process of CA CBT for Afghan refugees over the course of several trials and to highlight potential limitations by evaluating how systematic adaptations were performed. METHOD: The adaptation process of CA CBT was described in detail, including the methods and rationale for changes to the protocol. This process was analyzed according to a new set of proposed reporting criteria. RESULTS: According to the defined target population and based on multiple research strategies, culturally-specific components, such as the rationales for interventions, metaphors, and idioms of distress, were adapted. Relevant surface adaptations were implemented. However, although the steps of our adaptation process corresponded with the reporting criteria, some of the adaptation processes did not follow explicit criteria but resulted from implicit judgments. CONCLUSION: In the future, compliance with and the documentation of adaptation processes following explicit guidelines are crucial for the transfer of evidence-based approaches for managing the diversity of refugee populations.",0
"BACKGROUND: Interpreters in the care of refugees work in various different settings. Qualitative studies suggest that interpreters are confronted with a variety of demands depending on the context in which they work, which may in turn influence their wellbeing. To date, no larger-scale study has investigated differences between work settings regarding interpreters' work-related characteristics or wellbeing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the work-related characteristics and possible changes in the wellbeing of interpreters between four main work settings (psychotherapy, counselling, medical setting, and authorities) in the care of refugees. METHOD: Interpreters in refugee care were recruited for a nationwide online survey in Germany with two measurement time points. Participants provided socio-demographic data and answered questions about the working conditions in their respective main work setting. In addition, psychological distress (Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI-18), work-related exhaustion (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, CBI), and compassion satisfaction (Professional Quality of Life, ProQOL) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 158 interpreters were included at t1, of whom 63 were also included at t2. Significantly more traumatic content was interpreted in counselling settings and psychotherapy than in medical and authorities settings (H (3) = 26.09, p < .001). The highest proportion of interpreters with an interpreting degree worked in the authorities setting (Fisher's exact test, p = .002). Significant differences between the four settings were found for psychological distress (Kruskal-Wallis-test, H (3) = 12.02, p = .01) and work-related exhaustion (Kruskal-Wallis-test, H (3) = 8.10, p = .04) but not for compassion satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The presented results indicate differences regarding working conditions, psychological distress, and work-related exhaustion between different work settings of interpreters. Future studies may explore each setting in greater detail and include a larger sample size to reach a better understanding of the relationship between setting-specific challenges and interpreters' wellbeing.",0
"Human neuroimaging research suggests the existence of one core network for the subjective valuation of rewards, including the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. However, there is little research on the neural representation of subjective reward values of visual sexual stimuli (VSS) and on the role of these subjective valuations in the development of related addictive behaviors. Here, we investigate how neural reactivity to VSS is connected to individual preference using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During the fMRI scan, 72 men viewed different VSS film clips. Ratings regarding valence and sexual arousal were collected and used as parametric modulators in the fMRI analysis. Subjects also filled out questionnaires on self-reported symptoms of problematic pornography use (PPU). Firstly, we found that neural reactivity towards VSS clips in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex was positively correlated with individual ratings of the respective VSS in all subjects. Second, the strength of the association between neural activity and sexual arousal ratings was positively correlated with self-reported symptoms of PPU. The first result suggests a precise appraisal of VSS according to individual preferences in established reward valuation regions. Secondly, stronger neural differentiation based on preference in participants with more PPU symptoms indicates an increased importance of VSS/preference fit in these individuals. This heightened correspondence between individual liking and neural activity may facilitate PPU development by increased signaling of incentive salience, thus boosting motivation to seek out and respond to these preferred stimuli.",1
"Individual responses to behavioral treatment of anxiety disorders vary considerably, which requires a better understanding of underlying processes. In this study, we examined the violation and change of threat beliefs during exposure. From 8,484 standardized exposure records of 605 patients with different anxiety disorders, learning indicators were derived: expectancy violation as mismatch between threat expectancy before exposure and threat occurrence, expectancy change as difference between original and adjusted expectancy after exposure, and prediction-error learning rate as extent to which expectancy violation transferred into change. Throughout sessions, high threat expectancy but low occurrence and adjusted expectancy indicated successful violation and change of threat beliefs by exposure. Expectancy violation, change, and learning rate substantially varied between patients. Not expectancy violation itself, but higher learning rate and expectancy change predicted better treatment outcome. Successful exposure thus requires expectancy violation to induce actual expectancy change, supporting learning from prediction error as transdiagnostic mechanism underlying successful exposure therapy.",0
"AIM: The COVID-19 outbreak has severely impacted people's mental health. The present experimental study investigated how to reduce this negative effect by a combination of two interventions. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Participants (N (total) = 642) were users of social media in Germany. For two weeks, the social media group (N = 162) reduced its social media use (SMU) by 30 minutes daily, the physical activity group (N = 161) increased its physical activity by 30 minutes daily, the combination group (N = 159) followed both instructions, and the control group (N = 160) did not get specific instructions. Online surveys assessed variables of SMU, physical activity, mental health, COVID-19 burden, and lifestyle at six measurement time points up to six months after the intervention. RESULTS: In the experimental groups, (addictive) SMU, depression symptoms, and COVID-19 burden decreased, while physical activity, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness increased. All effects were stronger and more stable in the combination group in the longer-term. Smoking behavior decreased in the social media group only. CONCLUSION: Thus, the conscious combination of less SMU and more physical activity leads causally to more psychological resilience against negative pandemic impacts and to higher levels of mental health over six months. Prevention programs could improve their effectiveness by integrating the time- and cost-efficient interventions - separately or in combination. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10389-022-01751-x.",1
"Overestimating the occurrence of threatening events has been highlighted as a central cognitive factor in the maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The present study examined the different facets of this cognitive bias, its underlying mechanisms, and its specificity to OCD. For this purpose, threat estimation, probabilistic classification learning (PCL) and psychopathological measures were assessed in 23 participants with OCD, 30 participants with social phobia, and 31 healthy controls. Whereas healthy participants showed an optimistic expectation bias regarding positive and negative future events, OCD participants lacked such a bias. This lack of an optimistic expectation bias was not specific to OCD. Compared to healthy controls, OCD participants overestimated their personal risk for experiencing negative events, but did not differ from controls in their risk estimation regarding other people. Finally, OCD participants' biases in the prediction of checking-related events were associated with their impairments in learning probabilistic cue-outcome associations in a disorder-relevant context. In sum, the present results add to a growing body of research demonstrating that cognitive biases in OCD are context-dependent.",0
"Abstract Visual motion stimuli can induce the perception of self-motion in stationary observers (known as vection). In the present study, we investigated the sensory processing underlying vection by measuring the human event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by the movement onset of a visual stimulus. We presented participants a visual stimulus consisting of alternating black-and-white vertical bars that moved in horizontal direction, creating the sensation of vection. The stimulus was presented on a screen that was divided into a central and a surrounding peripheral visual area. Both areas moved independently from each other, resulting in four different movement patterns: the peripheral and the central stimulus moved in the same or opposite direction, or one of the two visual areas of the stimulus moved while the other remained stable. In addition, two different stimulus types varying with respect to the bars’ width (narrow vs. wide) were used. Participants were presented with these stimuli in two phases of the experiment: During EEG-recording, only short phases (2.5–3.5 ms) of visual motion were applied. In a separate rating phase, visual motion was presented for 45 s. In this phase, vection onset, intensity, and duration were verbally recorded. Overall, the visual stimulation generated vection with different intensities (i.e., weakest vection with sole central stimulus movement). Stimulus type did not affect vection. In the ERPs, stimulus onset elicited parieto-occipital P2 and N2 components. The amplitudes of the ERP components differed significantly between the four movement patterns (irrespective of stimulus type), however, they did not fully align with the subjective vection ratings. Since the ERPs are associated with early sensory processing preceding vection, we argue that the ERPs mirror the contribution of sensory cortical processes to vection rather than the subjective sensation of vection per se.",0
"BACKGROUND: The implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) in mental health care confers many benefits to patients, and research into factors facilitating the implementation of EBP is needed. As an important factor affecting the implementation of EBP, service providers' attitudes toward EBP emerged. The Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS-36) is an instrument with good psychometric characteristics that measures positive and ambivalent attitudes toward EBP. However, a German version is missing. The present study therefore aims to provide a validated German translation of the EBPAS-36. METHODS: The scale was translated and back-translated as recommended by standard procedures. German psychotherapists were recruited to participate in an online survey. They provided demographic and professional information, completed the EBPAS-36, the Implementation Climate Scale (ICS) and the Intention Scale for Providers (ISP). Standard item and reliability analyses were conducted. Construct validity was evaluated with exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) in two subsamples (random split). Convergent validity was tested by predicting a high positive correlation of the EBPAS-36D with two scores of attitudes of the ISP and an interest in EBP score. It was tested whether the EBPAS-36D predicts the intention to use EBP. RESULTS: N = 599 psychotherapists participated in the study. The item analyses showed a mean item difficulty of p(i )= 0.64, a mean inter-item correlation of r = 0.18, and a mean item-total correlation of r(itc) = 0.40. The internal consistency was very good for the total scale (alpha = 0.89) and ranged from adequate to very good for the subscales (0.65-0.89), indicating high reliability. The original factor structure showed an acceptable model fit (RMSEA = 0.064 (90% CI = 0.059-0.068); SRMR = 0.0922; AIC = 1400.77), confirming the 12-factor structure of the EBPAS-36. However, a second-order factor structure derived by the EFA had an even better model fit (RMSEA = 0.057 (90% CI = 0.052-0.062); SRMR = 0.0822; AIC = 1274.56). When the EBPAS-36D was entered in a hierarchical regression model with the criterion Intention to use EBP, the EBPAS-36D contributed significantly to the prediction (Change in R(2) = 0.28, p < 0.001) over and above gender, age and participants' report of ever having worked in a university context. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms good psychometric properties and validity of a German version of the EBPAS-36 in a sample of psychotherapists.",1
"Accidents caused by human errors illustrate the fragility of cognitive processing and its coordination by executive functions against stress. To better understand how core executive functions change over time, influence each other, and are affected by chronic stress exposure, a prospective cohort study was conducted from 2016 to 2019. Five hundred sixteen German adults aged 25-55 years (mean age/education age: 38.0/11.3 years, 67% females, 94% occupied, 20% smokers) completed at least one internet-based biannual assessment of response inhibition, updating, and set shifting using a Go/NoGo, spatial 2-Back, and Number-Letter task, respectively. Chronic stress exposure was indicated by self-reports on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC). Statistical analyses were performed by multivariate stochastic differential equation modeling. All indicators of executive functions (task-specific RTs in target trials or their contrast to nontarget trials) and chronic stress showed intraindividual stability over time (12% to 63% of their variance was attributable to trait influences). With respect to lagged mutual associations, faster Go/NoGo target RTs predicted faster Number-Letter target RTs later in time, while faster Number-Letter target RTs predicted higher HCC later in time (both with maximum effect sizes of d approximately 0.1 standard deviations). However, PSS was not predictive of later HCC and vice versa. None of the chronic stress indicators significantly predicted indicators of executive functions at subsequent time points. These findings suggest that set shifting is capable of modulating the body's physiological response to chronic stress exposure, whereas executive functions appear comparably robust against chronic stress exposure.

"Previous studies investigating family accommodation (FA) in pediatric anxiety disorders have primarily relied on mothers' reports, while data on FA by fathers remains scarce. We examined the frequency and correlates of fathers' FA of anxious children and compared fathers' and mothers' reports of FA. Participants were 69 parents of treatment-seeking children and adolescents with a primary anxiety disorder. FA was highly prevalent amongst fathers, with the majority of fathers participating in symptom-related behaviors and modifying family routines due to child anxiety. Fathers' accommodation levels were significantly correlated with fathers' reports of child internalizing symptoms, child externalizing symptoms, and fathers' own anxiety symptoms. Fathers' and mothers' reports of FA were moderately correlated, whereas their reports of their respective distress related to the need to accommodate were only weakly correlated. Fathers reported a significantly lower frequency of FA than did mothers. These findings highlight the importance of obtaining reports from both fathers and mothers when assessing FA. Results are particularly relevant to family-focused and parent-based interventions designed to address and reduce FA amongst parents of clinically anxious children.",1
"Enhanced self-focused attention (SFA) and negative attentional bias (NAB) towards social cues are characteristic hallmarks of social anxiety. It is essential to investigate these two attentional phenomena under socially relevant situations using comparable stimuli. In the present study, individuals with high social anxiety (HSA, n = 32) and low social anxiety (LSA, n = 29) were compared according to their attention toward self-related stimuli and toward positive, neutral, and negative feedback related stimuli. Video stimuli of moving indicators of self-anxiety-status and positive, neutral, and negative feedback from an audience were presented during an impromptu speech task (high anxiety condition) and a re-watching phase (low anxiety condition). Eye movements in response to the different stimuli served as readouts for attentional preference. An interaction effect suggested that the HSA group directed more attention to self-related stimuli relative to other stimuli and the LSA group only during the high anxiety condition. The LSA group exhibited a general attentional preference toward positive feedback, especially during the low anxiety condition. Meanwhile, only the total duration of fixation on positive feedback negatively correlated with subjective anxiety rating. Our results point to increased SFA rather than NAB in HSA individuals under social threats.",1
"Exposure-based interventions are a core ingredient of evidence-based cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, previous research has documented that exposure is rarely utilized in routine care, highlighting an ongoing lack of dissemination. The present study examined barriers for the dissemination of exposure from the perspective of behavioral psychotherapists working in outpatient routine care (N = 684). A postal survey assessed three categories of barriers: (a) practicability of exposure-based intervention in an outpatient private practice setting, (b) negative beliefs about exposure, and (c) therapist distress related to the use of exposure. In addition, self-reported competence to conduct exposure for different anxiety disorders, PTSD, and OCD was assessed. High rates of agreement were found for single barriers within each of the three categories (e.g., unpredictable time management, risk of uncompensated absence of the patient, risk of decompensation of the patient, superficial effectiveness, or exposure being very strenuous for the therapist). Separately, average agreement to each category negatively correlated with self-reported utilization of exposure to a moderate degree (-.35 </= r </= -.27). In a multiple regression model, only average agreement to barriers of practicability and negative beliefs were significantly associated with utilization rates. Findings illustrate that a multilevel approach targeting individual, practical, and systemic barriers is necessary to optimize the dissemination of exposure-based interventions. Dissemination efforts may therefore benefit from incorporating strategies such as modifying negative beliefs, adaptive stress management for therapists, or increasing practicability of exposure-based interventions.",0
"Introduction: The most prevalent psychotherapy schools are psychodynamic (PDT) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). There are no scientific guidelines on which type of patient should be treated by which therapist, and how they can find the best one. Part of the answer can be derived from data on who is treated in which way. Objective: Objective of this study was to compare patients in routine PDT and CBT to describe similarities and differences in regard to patient status and treatment. Materials and Methods: A research psychotherapist visited 73 cognitive behavior therapists and 58 psychodynamic psychotherapists in their office and asked them to report about the last cases they had seen. There were 188 CBT and 134 PD case reports. Results: There were no significant differences in socio-demographics between PDT and CBT patients. The average number of treatment session so far was significantly higher in PDT than CBT. There were longer duration of illness, more parallel medical treatments and higher rates of sick leave in CBT patients. While assessment of capacities with the Mini-ICF-APP showed no differences, more participation restrictions were found in CBT patients. Correspondingly there were more sociomedical interventions, especially in regard to work. Conclusions: The differences between PDT and CBT may be explained by the fact that PDT requires analytical capabilities on the side of the patient, which may exclude patients with social problems, while CBT is coping oriented which allows the inclusion of all kinds of patients. Still, in both treatment modes, complex patients are treated with multidimensional interventions.",0
"Neuroimaging studies have revealed partially shared neural substrates for both the actual experience of pain and empathy elicited by the pain of others. We examined whether prior pain exposure increased neural activity in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) and bilateral anterior insula (AI) as a correlate of empathy for pain. Participants (N=64: 32 women, 32 men) viewed pictures displaying exposure to pressure pain (pain pictures) and pictures without any cue of pain (neutral pictures). Prior to the experiment, half of the participants were exposed to the same pain stimulus as the one seen in the pain pictures (pain exposure condition); the other half had no such experience (touch exposure condition). A balanced sex ratio was kept, to investigate possible sex differences. In the region-of-interest analyses, participants of the pain exposure condition showed decreased activity in the right AI and the aMCC relative to participants of the touch exposure condition. While in men, no differences were found in relation to their exposure condition, women with pain exposure showed decreased activity in the aMCC and additionally, in bilateral AI. Based on the entire sample, whole brain analyses revealed stronger activation in the retrosplenial cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex in the pain exposure condition. In conclusion, prior pain exposure did not increase, but decreased activity in regions regularly associated with empathy for pain. However, pain experience increased activity in regions associated with memory retrieval, perspective taking, and top-down emotion regulation, which might facilitate empathizing with others.",0
"Emotional stability, as indicated by low affect variability and low affective reactivity to daily events, for example, tends to increase across the adult life span. This study investigated a contextual explanation for such age differences, relating affect variability and affective reactivity to age-group-specific life contexts. A sample of 101 younger and 103 older adults reported daily stressors and negative affect across 100 days. Compared with younger adults, older adults (a) experienced fewer stressors overall, (b) had less heterogeneous stressor profiles, and (c) reported that stressors had less impact on daily routines. As expected, these contextual factors were relevant for interindividual differences in emotional stability. Multiple regression analyses revealed that reduced affect variability and affective reactivity in older adults were associated with these age-group specific life contexts. Moreover, matching younger and older adults on the contextual factors to explore the effects of context on age-group differences further provided support for the (partially) contextual explanation of age differences in emotional stability. Matched subgroups of younger and older adults that were comparable on contextual variables were identified. Affective variability, but not affective reactivity, was more similar in the matched subsamples than in the total samples of younger and older adults. We conclude that contexts in which affective experiences emerge require more attention when aiming to explain interindividual and age group differences in emotional stability. Moreover, future studies need to disentangle the extent to which contexts interact with active self-regulatory processes to shape affective experiences across adulthood.",0
"Background. Pain symptoms, associated impairment, and parental perception of threat are reported to be predictors of health care utilization (HCU) in childhood chronic abdominal pain (CAP). However, mediating variables and their interrelations have not yet been systematically studied. Objectives. This study aims to identify mediating pathways of influence between child's abdominal pain and the number of pain-related medical visits. Methods. In a multicenter study, we recruited N = 151 parent-child dyads with children aged 6-17 years suffering from CAP. A composite measure of pain symptoms was defined as predictor and the number of pain-related medical visits as outcome variable. This relation was analyzed by serial mediation, including child- and parent-reported impairment and parental threat perception as mediators. Results. Only parental threat perception significantly linked child's pain symptoms to the number of medical visits. Measures of impairment did not have a significant effect. Conclusions. Parental pain-related threat perception is strongly related to health care seeking in childhood CAP. Addressing threat perception might be a fruitful parent-centered approach in clinical practice.",0
"Background/Objective: Depression and suicide ideation regularly occur together. Yet, little is known about factors that buffer individuals against the development of suicide ideation. The present study investigated, whether positive mental health buffers the association between depression and suicide ideation in a longitudinal study design. Methods: A total of 207 German students (70.3% female; age: M = 26.04, SD = 5.33) were assessed at a baseline evaluation and again twelve months later. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. Linear hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Positive mental health was considered to moderate the impact of depression on suicide ideation - controlling for age and gender. Results: Positive mental health was shown to moderate the impact of depression on suicide ideation: in those students who reported higher levels of positive mental health, depression severity showed no association with suicide ideation over time. Conclusion: Positive mental health seems to confer resilience and should be taken into account, when assessing individuals for suicide risk.",0
"Contextual information can modulate the conditioned response to a threat signal (conditioned stimulus, CS+): fear responses are either potentiated or attenuated depending on whether the context is threatening or safe. In this study, we investigated the influence of context on conditioned fear as well as on generalization of conditioned fear. Thirty-two participants underwent a cue-in-context learning protocol in virtual reality (VR). On Day 1 (acquisition), participants received a mild painful electric shock (unconditioned stimulus, US) in one virtual room (fear context, CTX+) at the offset of one colored light (CS+), but never at the offset of another colored light (CS-). In a second room (safety context, CTX-), the two lights were also presented, but not the US. Successful cue conditioning was indicated by aversive ratings and startle potentiation but not skin conductance responses (SCR) to CS+ versus CS- in CTX+ and not in CTX-. On Day 2 (generalization), participants re-visited both fear and safety contexts plus a generalization context (G-CTX), which was an equal mix of CTX+ and CTX-. The two CSs were shown again in all three contexts. Generalization of conditioned fear was revealed in affective ratings (CS+ was rated more aversive than CS- in G-CTX), but not in physiological measures (equal startle potentiation to CS+ versus CS- in all contexts). In sum, contextual information modulates the responses to a threat signal such that a safety context can inhibit conditioned fear. Interestingly, generalization processes also depend on contextual information.",0
"Different individuals respond differently to emotional stimuli in their environment. Therefore, to understand how emotions are represented mentally will ultimately require investigations into individual-level information. Here we tasked participants with freely arranging emotionally charged images on a computer screen according to their subjective emotional similarity (yielding a unique affective space for each participant) and subsequently sought external validity of the layout of the individuals' affective spaces through the five-factor personality model (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) assessed via the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Applying agglomerative hierarchical clustering to the group-level affective space revealed a set of underlying affective clusters whose within-cluster dissimilarity, per individual, was then correlated with individuals' personality scores. These cluster-based analyses predominantly revealed that the dispersion of the negative cluster showed a positive relationship with Neuroticism and a negative relationship with Conscientiousness, a finding that would be predicted by prior work. Such results demonstrate the non-spurious structure of individualized emotion information revealed by data-driven analyses of a behavioral task (and validated by incorporating psychological measures of personality) and corroborate prior knowledge of the interaction between affect and personality. Future investigations can similarly combine hypothesis- and data-driven methods to extend such findings, potentially yielding new perspectives on underlying cognitive processes, disease susceptibility, or even diagnostic/prognostic markers for mental disorders involving emotion dysregulation.",1
"In the current study, we test for the specificity of deficits in fear acquisition and extinction for the anxiety disorders spectrum. We compared fear acquisition and fear extinction learning between a group of patients with either an anxiety disorder (n = 93) or depression (n = 103) attending for treatment in our outpatient center and a sample of healthy control participants (n = 60). To assess the specificity of the predictive validity of extinction learning and safety learning for the outcome of exposure-based treatments, patients additionally underwent disorder-specific cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). We found only very little evidence for differences in safety or extinction learning between healthy controls and patients with anxiety-disorders or depression using both a group-based categorical analytic approach, as well as a trans-diagnostic, dimensional analytic approach. On the contrary, for anxiety patients only, more favorable extinction learning and more favorable safety learning was associated with more favorable treatment outcome. In sum, this specific prediction of treatment outcome in anxiety patients confirms and extends current theoretical models of exposure-based treatments for anxiety disorders, but does not support the notion of general extinction learning deficits in the anxiety disorders spectrum.",0
"BACKGROUND: Recent research has identified several cognitive biases in patients with eating disorders, such as a tendency to interpret ambiguous information about one's own body in a negative way. The so-called ""negative interpretation bias"" is considered to be a key factor in maintaining maladaptive cognitions and behaviors in eating disorders. Studies on modification of the negative interpretation bias in eating disorders have yielded mixed results. This randomized controlled pilot study examined whether a specially adapted, computerized version of the Scrambled Sentences Task modifies negative interpretation bias in women with elevated body dissatisfaction. METHODS: The sample consisted of 40 normal-weight women with elevated body dissatisfaction, randomly assigned either to an intervention or a no-intervention control group (each n = 20). The intervention group received six sessions (within two weeks) of a newly-developed interpretation bias modification training that involved unscrambling positively valenced, body image-related sentences. The control group received no intervention. In both groups, body image-related negative interpretation bias (main outcome), trait body dissatisfaction and thin-ideal cue reactivity were assessed at baseline and two weeks later. Additionally, in the intervention condition, the trajectory of expected reductions in the thin-ideal internalization was measured during each training session. RESULTS: In both conditions, body image-related negative interpretation bias and trait body dissatisfaction decreased significantly from pre- to post-assessment; however, a specific effect imparted by the interpretation bias modification training was not found. Groups did not differ in thin-ideal cue reactivity. In the intervention group, thin-ideal internalization decreased significantly over the training sessions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings do not support use of body image-related interpretation bias modification in its current form in the treatment of body dissatisfaction. Further research involving different versions of the training and clinical samples is warranted.",0
"Parenting requires mothers to read social cues and understand their children. It is particularly important that they recognise their child's emotions to react appropriately, for example, with compassion to sadness or compersion to happiness. Despite this importance, it is unclear how motherhood affects women's ability to recognise emotions associated with facial expressions in children. Using videos of an emotionally neutral face continually and gradually taking on a facial expression associated with an emotion, we quantified the amount of information needed to match the emotion with the facial expression. Mothers needed more information than non-mothers to match the emotions with the facial expressions. Both mothers and non-mothers performed equally on a control task identifying animals instead of emotions, and both groups needed less information when recognising the emotions associated with facial expressions in adolescents than pre-schoolers. These results indicate that mothers need more information for to correctly recognise typically associated emotions in child facial expressions but not for similar tasks not involving emotions. A possible explanation is that child facial expressions associated with emotions may have a greater emotional impact on mothers than non-mothers leading to task interference but possibly also to increased compassion and compersion.",1
"BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA) use has been shown to be associated with deficits in impulsivity, verbal learning, and working memory. Additionally, methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is related to various brain changes, especially in adolescent users who might be more vulnerable to detrimental effects on brain development. However, little is known about the relationship between adolescent MA use and cognitive impairment. This cross-sectional study aims to explore how the presence of a MUD in adolescents is related to impairments of verbal memory, inhibition, and alertness. METHODS: N = 18 psychiatric outpatients with MUD were matched in terms of depressivity, age, and gender to n = 18 adolescents with other substance use disorders (SUDs), as well as n = 18 controls without SUDs. We compared these three groups on the Verbal Learning and Memory Task (VLMT), and the alertness and go/noGo subtests of the Test of Attentional Performance (TAP). Additionally, Spearman's rank order correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate whether cognitive functioning was directly associated with frequency of past year MA use. RESULTS: The three groups differed significantly in their verbal learning performance (H (2) = 11.7, p = .003, eta(p)(2) = .19), but not in short-term memory, inhibition, cued recall, or alertness. Post hoc tests revealed significant differences in verbal learning between the MA using group and the control group without a SUD (U = 56.5, p = .001, eta(p)(2) = .31). Frequency of past year MA use correlated negatively with short-term memory (rho = -.25, p < .01) and verbal learning (rho = -.41, p < .01). No other cognitive variables correlated significantly with MA use frequency. Significant p-values were considered significant after Bonferroni correction. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent MUD outpatients with regular MA use show specific impairment in verbal learning performance, but not in other basal cognitive functions when compared to adolescents without a MUD. Verbal learning and short-term memory performance is negatively associated with the frequency of MA use. Future research should apply longitudinal designs to investigate long-term effects of methamphetamine and reversibility of these effects on cognitive functioning.",0
"Schizophrenia is associated with significant impairments in social cognition. These impairments have been shown to go along with altered activation of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). However, studies that investigate connectivity of pSTS during social cognition in schizophrenia are sparse. Twenty-two patients with schizophrenia and 22 matched healthy controls completed a social-cognitive task for functional magnetic resonance imaging that allows the investigation of affective Theory of Mind (ToM), emotion recognition and the processing of neutral facial expressions. Moreover, a resting-state measurement was taken. Patients with schizophrenia performed worse in the social-cognitive task (main effect of group). In addition, a group by social-cognitive processing interaction was revealed for activity, as well as for connectivity during the social-cognitive task, i.e., patients with schizophrenia showed hyperactivity of right pSTS during neutral face processing, but hypoactivity during emotion recognition and affective ToM. In addition, hypoconnectivity between right and left pSTS was revealed for affective ToM, but not for neutral face processing or emotion recognition. No group differences in connectivity from right to left pSTS occurred during resting state. This pattern of aberrant activity and connectivity of the right pSTS during social cognition might form the basis of false-positive perceptions of emotions and intentions and could contribute to the emergence and sustainment of delusions.",0
"BACKGROUND: Deficits in emotion regulation skills are possible factors maintaining major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, the aim of the study was to test whether integrating a systematic emotion regulation training (ERT) enhances the efficacy of routine inpatient cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for MDD. METHODS: In a prospective randomized controlled trial, 432 inpatients meeting criteria for MDD were assigned to receive either routine CBT or CBT enriched with an intense emotion regulation skills training (CBT-ERT). RESULTS: Participants in the CBT-ERT condition demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in depression (response rates - CBT: 75.5%, CBT-ERT: 84.9%; remission rates - CBT: 51.1%, CBT-ERT: 65.1%). Moreover, CBT-ERT participants demonstrated a significantly greater reduction of negative affect, as well as a greater increase of well-being and emotion regulation skills particularly relevant for mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating strategies that target emotion regulation skills improves the efficacy of CBT for MDD.",1
"BACKGROUND: Research has shown that negative expectations in major depressive disorder (MDD) often persist despite positive disconfirming experiences. To explain this phenomenon, the concept of cognitive immunization has been introduced: that is, individuals with MDD reappraise disconfirming positive evidence in such a way that negative expectations are maintained. In this study, we examined whether it is possible to inhibit cognitive immunization to facilitate expectation update. METHODS: We examined 113 people with MDD being treated in an inpatient psychosomatic hospital. Using a previously validated paradigm, participants worked on a standardized performance test; we examined changes in negative performance-related expectations after positive expectation-disconfirming feedback. One experimental group received additional information increasing the value of the positive feedback ('INFORMATION'). Another group was instructed to recall the feedback after completing the task ('RECALL'). In a third group, participants' attention was shifted to potential expectation-disconfirming feedback ('ATTENTION'). In addition, a control group underwent the standard procedure of the paradigm. RESULTS: The results showed significant group differences in the change in generalized performance expectations, with the largest changes in participants from the INFORMATION group. All experimental groups had lower values for cognitive immunization than the control group. LIMITATIONS: Given that this proof-of-concept study was the first to examine strategies to inhibit cognitive immunization, the findings need to be replicated in future studies. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that cognitive immunization in MDD can be inhibited, thus facilitating adjusting negative expectations. The most promising results were found for the INFORMATION group, providing information to emphasize the relevance of expectation-disconfirming information.",1
"OBJECTIVE: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) rating scales such as the Conners' Rating Scales (CRS) are valuable adjuncts for diagnosis, since they offer parent, teacher, and self-ratings of children susceptible for ADHD. Even though the scales are widely used internationally, cross-cultural comparability has rarely been verified, and culture and language invariance have only been presumed. The Conners 3((R)) rating scales are the updated version of the CRS, though hardly any studies report the psychometric properties apart from the results published in the test edition itself. To our knowledge there are no studies on the various adaptations of the Conners 3((R)) in other languages. METHOD: The German translations of the Conners 3((R)) were completed by 745 children, 953 parents, and 741 teachers (children's age range: 6-18 years, mean: 11.74 years of age). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on content scale items were conducted to obtain the factor structure for the German version and to replicate the factor structure of the original American models. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to establish internal consistency. RESULTS: The exploratory analyses for the German model resulted in factor structures globally different from the American model, though confirmatory analyses revealed very good model fi ts with highly satisfying Cronbach's alphas. We were able to provide empirical evidence for the subscale Inattention which had only hypothetically been derived by Conners (2008). CONCLUSIONS: Even though the exploratory analyses resulted in different factor structures, the confirmatory analyses have such excellent psychometric properties that use of the German adaptation of the Conners 3((R)) is justifi ed in international multicenter studies.",1
"Background: Stressful life events and suicide ideation regularly occur together. Yet, little is known about factors that buffer individuals against the development of suicide ideation. Aim: In a long-term follow-up study design, it was investigated whether positive mental health, that is, high levels of subjective and psychological well-being, buffers the association between stressful life events and suicide ideation. Method: A total of 126 German students (80.2% female; age: M = 24.29, SD = 5.21) were assessed at a baseline evaluation and again 24 months later. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. Results: Linear hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Positive mental health was considered to moderate the impact of stressful life events on suicide ideation - controlling for age and gender. Limitations: Current results are limited to university students. Conclusions: Positive mental health interacts with stressful life events, such that those with high levels of positive mental health show an attenuated increase in suicide ideation at elevated levels of stress. Positive mental health seems to confer resilience and should be focused on in counseling centers for students.",1
"Pain perception and the ability to modulate arising pain vary tremendously between individuals. It has been shown that endurance athletes possess higher pain tolerance thresholds and a greater effect of conditioned pain modulation than nonathletes, both indicating a more efficient system of endogenous pain inhibition. The aim of the present study was to focus on the neural mechanisms of pain processing in endurance athletes that have not been investigated yet. Therefore, we analyzed the pain processing of 18 male athletes and 19 healthy male nonathletes using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found lower pain ratings in endurance athletes compared to nonathletes to physically identical painful stimulation. Furthermore, brain activations of athletes versus nonathletes during painful heat stimulation revealed reduced activation in several brain regions that are typically activated by nociceptive stimulation. This included the thalamus, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, midcingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and brain stem (BS). Functional connectivity analyses revealed stronger network during painful heat stimulation in athletes between the analyzed brain regions except for connections with the BS that showed reduced functional connectivity in athletes. Post hoc correlation analyses revealed associations of the subject's fitness level and the brain activation strengths, subject's fitness level and functional connectivity, and brain activation strengths and functional connectivity. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time that endurance athletes do not only differ in behavioral variables compared to nonathletes, but also in the neural processing of pain elicited by noxious heat.",1
"BACKGROUND: To investigate the powerful placebo effects in antidepressant drug trials and their mechanisms, recent pioneering experimental studies showed that expectation manipulation combined with an active placebo attenuated induced sadness. In the present study, we aimed at extending these findings by assessing the psychophysiological response in addition to mere self-report. METHODS: One hundred and thirteen healthy female students were randomly assigned to a drug expectation group (active placebo, positive treatment expectation), placebo expectation group (active placebo, no treatment expectation), or a no-treatment group (no placebo, no treatment expectation). After placebo intake, sadness was induced by self-deprecating statements using the Velten method combined with sad music, including a rumination phase. Sadness was measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Expanded Form (PANAS-X). Heart rate and skin conductance were assessed continuously. RESULTS: After mood induction and after rumination, self-reported sadness was significantly lower, and skin conductance level was significantly higher, in the drug expectation group than in the no-treatment group. The mood induction was further accompanied by a heart rate deceleration within all groups. LIMITATIONS: Generalizability is limited by sample selectivity and focusing on sadness as a symptom of depression, exclusively. CONCLUSION: Expectation-induced placebo effects significantly influenced sadness-correlated changes in autonomic arousal, and not only subjectively reported sadness, indicating that placebo effects in the context of affect are not merely due to subjective response bias. The systematic modification of treatment expectation could be utilized in clinical practice to optimize current therapeutic approaches to improve mood regulation.",1
"Previous research on expectation updating in relation to psychopathology used to treat expectation-confirming information and expectation-disconfirming information as binary concepts. Here, we varied the extent to which new information deviates from prior expectations and examined its influence on expectation adjustment in both a false-feedback task (Study 1; N = 379) and a social-interaction task (Study 2; N = 292). Unlike traditional learning models, we hypothesized a tipping point in which the discrepancy between expectation and outcome becomes so large that new information is perceived as lacking credibility, thus entailing little updating of expectations. Consistent with the hypothesized tipping point, new information was deemed most valid if it was moderately positive. Moreover, descriptively, expectation update was largest for moderate expectation violations, but this effect was small (Study 2) or even nonsignificant (Study 1). The findings question the assumption of traditional learning models that the larger the prediction error, the larger the update.",0
"What we see is the result of an efficient selection of cues in the visual stream. In addition to physical characteristics this process is also influenced by emotional salience of the cues. Previously, we showed in spider phobic patients that fear-related pictures gain preferential access to consciousness in binocular rivalry. We set out to replicate this in an independent unselected sample and examine the relationship of this perceptual bias with a range of symptom clusters. To this end, we recruited 79 participants with variable degrees of fear of spiders. To induce binocular rivalry, a picture of either a spider or a flower was projected to one eye, and a neutral geometric pattern to the other eye. Participants continuously reported what they saw. We correlated indices of perceptual dominance (first percept, dominance duration) with individual fear of spiders and with scores on specific symptom clusters of fear of spiders (i.e., vigilance, fixation, and avoidance coping). Overall, higher fear of spiders correlates with more predominace of spider pictures. In addition, this perceptual bias is uniquely associated with avoidance coping. Interestingly, this demonstrates that a perceptual bias, which is not intentionally controlled, is linked with an instrumental coping behavior, that has been implicated in the maintenance of pathological fear.",1
"Background: The proposed ICD-11 criteria for trauma-related disorders define posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex posttraumatic stress disorder (cPTSD) as separate disorders. Results of previous studies support the validity of this concept. However, due to limitations of existing studies (e.g. homogeneity of the samples), the present study aimed to test the construct validity and factor structure of cPTSD and its distinction from PTSD using a heterogeneous trauma-exposed sample. Method: Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted to explore the factor structure of the proposed ICD-11 cPTSD diagnosis in a sample of 341 trauma-exposed adults (n = 191 female, M = 37.42 years, SD = 12.04). In a next step, latent profile analyses (LPAs) were employed to evaluate predominant symptom profiles of cPTSD symptoms. Results: The results of the CFA showed that a six-factor structure (i.e. symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal and symptoms of affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal problems) fits the data best. According to LPA, a four-class solution optimally characterizes the data. Class 1 represents moderate PTSD and low symptoms in the specific cPTSD clusters (PTSD group, 30.4%). Class 2 showed low symptom severity in all six clusters (low symptoms group, 24.1%). Classes 3 and 4 both exhibited cPTSD symptoms but differed with respect to the symptom severity (Class 3: cPTSD, 34.9% and Class 4: severe cPTSD, 10.6%). Conclusions: The findings replicate previous studies supporting the proposed factor structure of cPTSD in ICD-11. Additionally, the results support the validity and usefulness of conceptualizing PTSD and cPTSD as discrete mental disorders.",1
"BACKGROUND: Somatoform disorders are characterized by multiple recurring symptoms that resemble physical illnesses but defy medical explanation. Psychological models suggest that catastrophizing misinterpretations of harmless physical symptoms play a key role. However, the question of whether such biases predict somatoform-related symptoms and the onset of somatoform disorders has not been adressed. Hence, the aim of the present study was to further advance our understanding of the role of catastrophizing misinterpretations in somatoform disorders. METHODS: In the present study, we used data from the Dresden Predictor Study (N=1538), in which an epidemiologic sample of young German women was tested at two time points approximately 17 months apart. Each participant completed a diagnostic interview, an interpretation questionnaire for somatoform and hypochondriacal symptoms, and three measures of such symptomatology: somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), Whiteley Index (WI), Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ). RESULTS: At follow-up, 33 women were diagnosed with new onsets of lifetime somatoform disorder. Results showed that catastrophizing misinterpretations assessed at baseline were predictive of somatoform-related symptoms at follow-up, i.e., symptoms assessed with the WI and BSQ. Moreover, catastrophizing misinterpretations were predictive of new onsets of somatoform disorders, even after controlling for general threat-related misinterpretations and indices of somatoform symptoms (i.e., SCL-90-R and BSQ). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective, longitudinal study to demonstrate that catastrophizing misinterpretations have incremental validity as predictors of future somatoform-related symptomatology and somatoform disorders.",1
"Social interaction requires fast and efficient processing of another person's intentions. In face-to-face interactions, aversive or appetitive actions typically co-occur with emotional expressions, allowing an observer to anticipate action intentions. In the present study, we investigated the influence of facial emotions on the processing of action intentions. Thirty-two participants were presented with video clips showing virtual agents displaying a facial emotion (angry vs. happy) while performing an action (punch vs. fist-bump) directed towards the observer. During each trial, video clips stopped at varying durations of the unfolding action, and participants had to recognize the presented action. Naturally, participants' recognition accuracy improved with increasing duration of the unfolding actions. Interestingly, while facial emotions did not influence accuracy, there was a significant influence on participants' action judgements. Participants were more likely to judge a presented action as a punch when agents showed an angry compared to a happy facial emotion. This effect was more pronounced in short video clips, showing only the beginning of an unfolding action, than in long video clips, showing near-complete actions. These results suggest that facial emotions influence anticipatory processing of action intentions allowing for fast and adaptive responses in social interactions.",0
"The method-of-limits (MLI) is an established psychophysical procedure, for example for determining thermal thresholds. The standard MLI relies on fixating the thermode at the stimulation site by means of a strap and requires the participant to terminate the increase in heat by pressing a button. This, however, raises concerns regarding safety and task complexity in specific populations, such as cognitively impaired individuals, people with high fear of pain or young children (< 6 years). In this study, we aimed at developing a simplified version of the commonly used MLI for testing heat pain threshold (HPT) and tolerance (HPTol), and at validating it as a first step in healthy adults. Heating is terminated by withdrawing the hand from the heat probe, thereby ensuring maximum control and safety. For validation, HPTs and HPTols were assessed with the novel ""hand-withdrawal-method"" (HWM) and compared to the standard MLI, using a within-subject design. Additionally, as one potential research area in which the HWM may be used, we explored expectancy-induced placebo hypoalgesic effects by comparing results of standard MLI with those of HWM. Our data confirm good concordance between the 2 methods. For none of the outcomes significant differences between the 2 methods were found. PERSPECTIVE: In the present study in healthy adults, an adapted simplified and safe method of limits was demonstrated to be equivalent to the standard method-of-limits. This novel behavioral ""hand-withdrawal-method"" seems promising for future investigations of pain sensitivity and placebo effects, especially for specific populations such as young children.",1
"Reduced physical activity is considered a key feature of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, research directly comparing non-depressed controls and patients yielded mixed findings. In contrast to most previous research, this study compared objective as well as subjective activity levels of individuals with MDD with non-depressed controls and used an ambulatory assessment method. Moreover, we investigated whether objective and subjective measures of activity could predict mood. On two consecutive days, physical activity of 35 MDD patients and 36 non-depressed control participants were assessed objectively using an accelerometer and subjectively with hourly ecological momentary assessments. During the same assessment, participants mood was monitored. No significant differences between MDD patients and control participants in objective and most of the subjective activity measures were observed. We found significant associations between objective and subjective measures of activity in non-depressed as well as in MDD patients. Objective but not subjective measures of activity predicted subsequent mood. Our results support the notion that the association between MDD and activity level is complex and depends on moderating factors.",0
"Attentional biases play an important role in the development and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous studies using reaction time tasks in OCD have produced inconsistent results. This is the first study to measure attentional biases in patients with several subtypes of OCD using eye tracking. Twenty-eight patients with OCD and 21 healthy controls were assessed using a free-viewing paradigm, incorporating contamination-related, checking-related, and neutral stimuli. Attentional patterns were measured using an eye tracker. A possible vigilance bias was assessed using entry time, and a possible maintenance bias was assessed using dwell time. Patients with checking-related symptoms of OCD showed a maintenance bias but no vigilance bias in regard to checking-related compared to neutral stimuli. No differences in attention were found in patients with contamination-related symptoms. Internal validity is restricted due to a high overlap between subgroups, the lack of negative (not OCD-related) control stimuli, and the absence of a clinical control group. Patients with checking-related symptoms of OCD showed a maintenance bias to checking-related stimuli. Due to methodological limitations, the results should be considered preliminary and need to be replicated before firm conclusions can be drawn.",0
"Previous research suggests that state anxiety may sway political attitudes. However, previous experimental procedures induced anxiety using political contexts (e.g., social or economic threat). In a pre-registered laboratory experiment, we set out to examine if anxiety that is unrelated to political contexts can influence political attitudes. We induced anxiety with a threat of shock paradigm, void of any political connotation. All participants were instructed that they might receive an electric stimulus during specified threat periods and none during safety periods. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: Political attitudes (implicit and explicit) were assessed under safety in one condition and under threat in the other. Psychometric, as well as physiological data (skin conductance, heart rate), confirmed that anxiety was induced successfully. However, this emotional state did not alter political attitudes. In a Bayesian analytical approach, we confirmed the absence of an effect. Our results suggest that state anxiety by itself does not sway political attitudes. Previously observed effects that were attributed to anxiety may be conditional on a political context of threat.",0
"Reliability and validity of the OPD-CA Conflict Questionnaire in an adolescent inpatient sample Abstract. ﻿Abstracts:﻿ The OPD-CA Conflict Questionnaire (OPD-CA-CQ) assesses intrapsychic conflicts according to the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnosis in Childhood and Adolescence (OPD-CA-2) in a simple and time-efficient way. The questionnaire exists in two versions: as a self-report measure for adolescents and as an informant-report measure for therapists. We examined the psychometric criteria of the questionnaire (internal consistency, construct validity, convergent validity) in a sample of adolescent inpatients. Overall, results were heterogeneous: Some scales of the questionnaire seem to be suitable for assessing the corresponding intrapsychic conflicts, while others require a critical review. Particularly the conflict scales closeness vs. distance and submission vs. control need revision.",0
"This study examines students’ use of self-regulated motor learning strategies related to a congruent or incongruent teacher-student fit-constellation of perceived and preferred teaching behavior. In a cross-sectional study in German grammar schools, 1452 students and 18 physical education teachers participated. The results of the study indicate that students apply more self-regulated motor learning strategies in specific fit-constellation. In addition, when the teachers’ self-perception of teaching behavior exceeds the respective perception and preference of the students, this overregulation impairs the satisfaction with and interest in physical education as well as self-regulated motor learning",1
"IMPORTANCE: The structural abnormalities in the brain that accurately differentiate unipolar depression (UD) and bipolar depression (BD) remain unidentified. OBJECTIVES: First, to investigate and compare morphometric changes in UD and BD, and to replicate the findings at 2 independent neuroimaging sites; second, to differentiate UD and BD using multivariate pattern classification techniques. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a 2-center cross-sectional study, structural gray matter data were obtained at 2 independent sites (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Munster, Germany) using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare local gray and white matter volumes, and a novel pattern classification approach was used to discriminate between UD and BD, while training the classifier at one imaging site and testing in an independent sample at the other site. The Pittsburgh sample of participants was recruited from the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at the University of Pittsburgh from 2008 to 2012. The Munster sample was recruited from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Munster from 2010 to 2012. Equally divided between the 2 sites were 58 currently depressed patients with bipolar I disorder, 58 age- and sex-matched unipolar depressed patients, and 58 matched healthy controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Magnetic resonance imaging was used to detect structural differences between groups. Morphometric analyses were applied using voxel-based morphometry. Pattern classification techniques were used for a multivariate approach. RESULTS: At both sites, individuals with BD showed reduced gray matter volumes in the hippocampal formation and the amygdala relative to individuals with UD (Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates x = -22, y = -1, z = 20; k = 1938 voxels; t = 4.75), whereas individuals with UD showed reduced gray matter volumes in the anterior cingulate gyrus compared with individuals with BD (Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates x = -8, y = 32, z = 3; k = 979 voxels; t = 6.37; all corrected P < .05). Reductions in white matter volume within the cerebellum and hippocampus were found in individuals with BD. Pattern classification yielded up to 79.3% accuracy (P < .001) by differentiating the 2 depressed groups, training and testing the classifier at one site, and up to 69.0% accuracy (P < .001), training the classifier at one imaging site (Pittsburgh) and testing it at the other independent sample (Munster). Medication load did not alter the pattern of results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Individuals with UD and those with BD are differentiated by structural abnormalities in neural regions supporting emotion processing. Neuroimaging and multivariate pattern classification techniques are promising tools to differentiate UD from BD and show promise as future diagnostic aids.",1
"BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by deficits in cognitive control (CC). Impaired CC has been found in high-risk samples and is associated with the maintenance of BD symptoms. It remains unclear, however, whether BD is characterized by a general deficit in CC or by a deficit that is specifically related to the processing of emotional material. METHODS: The sample consisted of 42 remitted bipolar patients and 39 healthy controls (HC). We examined whether BD individuals display impaired CC when confronted with negative as well as positive material using an arithmetic inhibition task that required inhibition of pictorial stimulus material. RESULTS: Whereas both groups showed difficulties in exerting CC over negative material, only BD individuals exhibited deficient CC over positive material. LIMITATIONS: Even though we intended the negative and positive pictures in the arithmetic inhibition task to be similarly arousing, participants in the current study rated the negative compared to the positive pictures as more arousing. CONCLUSIONS: BD is associated with impaired CC when processing emotional - especially positive - stimuli even when patients are in remission. Possible implications of this deficit especially for emotion regulation are discussed.",0
"Adequate defensive responding is crucial for mental health but scientifically not well understood. Specifically, it seems difficult to dissociate defense and approach states based on autonomic response patterns. We thus explored the robustness and threat-specificity of recently described oculomotor dynamics upon threat in anticipation of either threatening or rewarding stimuli in humans. While visually exploring naturalistic images, participants (50 per experiment) expected an inevitable, no, or avoidable shock (Experiment 1) or a guaranteed, no, or achievable reward (Experiment 2) that could be averted or gained by a quick behavioural response. We observed reduced heart rate (bradycardia), increased skin conductance, pupil dilation and globally centralized gaze when shocks were inevitable but, more pronouncedly, when they were avoidable. Reward trials were not associated with globally narrowed visual exploration, but autonomic responses resembled characteristics of the threat condition. While bradycardia and concomitant sympathetic activation reflect not only threat-related but also action-preparatory states independent of valence, global centralization of gaze seems a robust phenomenon during the anticipation of avoidable threat. Thus, instead of relying on single readouts, translational research in animals and humans should consider the multi-dimensionality of states in aversive and rewarding contexts, especially when investigating ambivalent, conflicting situations.",0
"Blended therapy is a new approach combining advantages of face-to-face psychotherapy and Internet- and mobile-based interventions. Acceptance is a fundamental precondition for its implementation. The aim of this study was to assess 1) the acceptance of psychotherapists towards blended therapy, 2) the effectiveness of an acceptance facilitating intervention (AFI) on psychotherapists' acceptance towards blended therapy and 3) to identify potential effect moderators. Psychotherapists (N = 284) were randomly assigned to a control (CG) or an intervention group (IG). The IG received a short video showing an example of blended therapy, the CG an attention placebo video. Both groups received a reliable online questionnaire assessing acceptance, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence and internet anxiety. Between group differences were examined using t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests. Exploratory analysis was conducted to identify moderators. Psychotherapists in CG showed mixed baseline acceptance towards blended therapy (low = 40%, moderate = 33%, high = 27%). IG showed significantly higher acceptance compared to CG (d = .27, pone-sided = .029; low = 24%, moderate = 47%, high = 30%). Bootstrapped confidence intervals were overlapping. Performance expectancy (d = .35), effort expectancy (d = .44) and facilitating conditions (d = .28) were significantly increased (p < .05). No effects on social influence and internet anxiety were found (p>.05). Exploratory analysis indicated psychodynamic oriented psychotherapists profiting particularly from the AFI. Blended therapy is a promising approach to improve healthcare. Psychotherapists show mixed acceptance, which might be improvable by AFIs, particularly in subpopulations of initially rather skeptical psychotherapists. Forthcoming studies should extend the present study by shifting focus from attitudes to the impact of different forms of AFIs on uptake.",0
"This article introduces the freely available Bochum Emotional Stimulus Set (BESST), which contains pictures of bodies and faces depicting either a neutral expression or one of the six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and surprise), presented from two different perspectives (0 degrees frontal view vs. camera averted by 45 degrees to the left). The set comprises 565 frontal view and 564 averted view pictures of real-life bodies with masked facial expressions and 560 frontal and 560 averted view faces which were synthetically created using the FaceGen 3.5 Modeller. All stimuli were validated in terms of categorization accuracy and the perceived naturalness of the expression. Additionally, each facial stimulus was morphed into three age versions (20/40/60 years). The results show high recognition of the intended facial expressions, even under speeded forced-choice conditions, as corresponds to common experimental settings. The average naturalness ratings for the stimuli range between medium and high.",1
"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is hypothesized to be characterized by altered reinforcement sensitivity. The main aim of the present study was to assess alterations in the electrophysiological correlates of monetary reward processing in adult patients with ADHD of the combined subtype. Fourteen adults with ADHD of the combined subtype and 14 healthy control participants performed an active and an observational probabilistic reward-based learning task while an electroencephalogramm (EEG) was recorded. Regardless of feedback valence, there was a general feedback-related negativity (FRN) enhancement in combination with reduced learning performance during both active and observational reward learning in patients with ADHD relative to healthy controls. Other feedback-locked potentials such as the P200 and P300 and response-locked potentials were unaltered in the patients. There were no significant correlations between learning performance, FRN amplitudes and clinical symptoms, neither in the overall group involving all participants, nor in patients or controls considered separately. This pattern of findings might reflect generally impaired reward prediction in adults with ADHD of the combined subtype. We demonstrated for the first time that patients with ADHD of the combined subtype show not only deficient active reward learning but are also impaired when learning by observing other people׳s outcomes.",0
"Asking people to provide global judgments, or trait reports, of their affective experience is a standard method for assessing trait affective well-being, with countless applications in the social sciences. Trait reports reflect numerous influences that generally go unnoticed. Although state affect is a highly plausible candidate for such influences, this source of unwanted variance does not receive much attention and is usually not controlled for in empirical studies. Using 100-day data from the COGITO study, we provide direct and strong evidence that trait reports of affect depend on how people feel at the time they provide the evaluations (i.e., their affective state). For example, participants experiencing more positive affect on a specific day relative to their individual mean also provide more positive ratings of their global affective experience. Furthermore, we found that current affect influences trait ratings in a surprisingly differentiated way--those particular facets of affect that are more/less prevalent at a certain moment are believed to occur more/less often in general. We stress the need for repeated observations within individuals to estimate state contributions to standard assessments of trait affect, to distinguish between state and trait in psychological assessment, and to achieve good indicators of affective experiences in the social and medical sciences.",1
"BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults with abuse-related post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been shown to benefit from Developmentally Adapted Cognitive Processing Therapy (D-CPT), yet long-term efficacy of D-CPT has not yet been studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term efficacy of D-CPT in a sample of adolescents and young adults (age 14-21 years) with childhood abuse related PTSD. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Patients of a previously conducted multicenter randomized controlled trial which showed the efficacy of D-CPT compared to a waitlist with treatment advice (WL/TA) were invited for follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months after the end of treatment. METHODS: Primary outcome was the PTSD symptom severity, assessed with the Clinician-administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents (CAPS-CA). Secondary outcomes were self-reported PTSD severity, depression, borderline symptom severity, behavior problems, and dissociation. RESULTS: Of the 44 participants who received D-CPT, 28 (63 %) responded and were assessed at 6-month follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 22 participants (50 %) responded. The majority of participants in the WL/TA group received D-CPT after the end of the trial and were hence not available for follow-up assessment. In the D-CPT group, treatment gains were maintained at 6- and 12-month follow-up in the CAPS-CA as well as in all secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The positive effects of D-CPT were stable in adolescents and young adults with abuse-related PTSD indicating that they can benefit in the long term from a treatment with D-CPT.",1
"The peritraumatic cognitive process of mental defeat, the complete loss of inner resistance, has been identified as a key predictor of PTSD. Yet, most evidence on cognitive risk factors stems from industrialized countries where survivors typically report few traumata. Research from postconflict settings indicates that individual differences decrease with accumulating traumatic experiences, as almost everybody develops PTSD at extreme levels of trauma load. Would this leave less room for the impact of cognitive processes? In a sample of 227 Ugandan rebel war survivors, we investigated whether mental defeat influences trauma-related psychopathology in regression models accounting for cumulative trauma exposure. We found strong main effects of mental defeat on lifetime PTSD risk, current PTSD severity and dissociative symptoms, but no mental defeat × trauma load interaction effects. Our results indicate that peritraumatic mental defeat is central to understand individual differences in psychological reactions after single traumatic events as well as multiple traumatization.",0
"We present a quantitative study of mental time travel to the past and future in sleep onset hypnagogia. Three independent, blind judges analysed a total of 150 mentation reports from different intervals prior to and after sleep onset. The linguistic tool for the mentation report analysis grounds on established grammatical and cognitive-semantic theories, and proof of concept has been provided in previous studies. The current results indicate that memory for the future, but not for the past, decreases in sleep onset - thereby supporting preliminary physiological evidence at the level of brain function. While recent memory research emphasizes similarities in the cognitive and physiological processes of mental time travel to the past and future, the current study explores a state of consciousness which may serve to dissociate between the two.",0
"Cognitive models propose that both, negative interpretations of ambiguous social situations and ruminative thoughts about social events contribute to the maintenance of social anxiety disorder. It has further been postulated that ruminative thoughts fuel biased negative interpretations, however, evidence is rare. The present study used a multi-method approach to assess ruminative processing following a social interaction (post-event processing by self-report questionnaire and social rumination by experience sampling method) and negative interpretation bias (via two separate tasks) in a student sample (n = 51) screened for high (HSA) and low social anxiety (LSA). Results support the hypothesis that group differences in negative interpretations of ambiguous social situations in HSAs vs. LSAs are mediated by higher levels of post-event processing assessed in the questionnaire. Exploratory analyses highlight the potential role of comorbid depressive symptoms. The current findings help to advance the understanding of the association between two cognitive processes involved in social anxiety and stress the importance of ruminative post-event processing.",1
"Previous research indicates that anxiety disorders are characterized by an overgeneralization of conditioned fear as compared with healthy participants. Therefore, fear generalization is considered a key mechanism for the development of anxiety disorders. However, systematic investigations on the variance in fear generalization are lacking. Therefore, the current study aims at identifying distinctive phenotypes of fear generalization among healthy participants. To this end, 1175 participants completed a differential fear conditioning phase followed by a generalization test. To identify patterns of fear generalization, we used a k-means clustering algorithm based on individual arousal generalization gradients. Subsequently, we examined the reliability and validity of the clusters and phenotypical differences between subgroups on the basis of psychometric data and markers of fear expression. Cluster analysis reliably revealed five clusters that systematically differed in mean responses, differentiation between conditioned threat and safety, and linearity of the generalization gradients, though mean response levels accounted for most variance. Remarkably, the patterns of mean responses were already evident during fear acquisition and corresponded most closely to psychometric measures of anxiety traits. The identified clusters reliably described subgroups of healthy individuals with distinct response characteristics in a fear generalization test. Following a dimensional view of psychopathology, these clusters likely delineate risk factors for anxiety disorders. As crucial group characteristics were already evident during fear acquisition, our results emphasize the importance of average fear responses and differentiation between conditioned threat and safety as risk factors for anxiety disorders.",1
"Full-blown panic attacks are frequently associated with other mental disorders. Most comorbidity analyses did not discriminate between isolated panic attacks vs. panic attacks that occurred in the context of a panic disorder and rarely evaluated the impact of comorbid agoraphobia. Moreover, there are no larger scale epidemiological studies regarding the influence of sub-threshold panic attacks. 4075 German-speaking respondents aged 18-64 were interviewed using the fully structured Munich Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Limited symptom attacks, isolated panic attacks, and panic disorder were associated with other lifetime DSM-IV disorders with monotonically increasing odds and increasing tendency for multiple comorbidities across the three groups. The presence of agoraphobia was associated with more frequent comorbidity in all panic subgroups and also in persons who never experienced panic attacks. The present study suggests that populations with isolated or limited symptom should be carefully attended to in clinical practice, especially if agoraphobia is present.",1
"Memory is better for items arbitrarily assigned to the self than for items assigned to another person (mere ownership effect, MOE). In a series of six experiments, we investigated the role of semantic processes for the MOE. Following successful replication, we investigated whether the MOE was contingent upon semantic processing: For meaningless stimuli, there was no MOE. Testing for a potential role of semantic elaboration using meaningful stimuli in an encoding task without verbal labels, we found evidence of spontaneous semantic processing irrespective of self- or other-assignment. When semantic organization was manipulated, the MOE vanished if a semantic classification task was added to the self/other assignment but persisted for a perceptual classification task. Furthermore, we found greater clustering of self-assigned than of other-assigned items in free recall. Taken together, these results suggest that the MOE could be based on the organizational principle of a ""me"" versus ""not-me"" categorization.",1
"The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a widely used diagnostic interview for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Following fundamental modifications in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the CAPS had to be revised. This study examined the psychometric properties (internal consistency, interrater reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, and structural validity) of the German version of the CAPS-5 in a trauma-exposed sample (n = 223 with PTSD; n =51 without PTSD). The results demonstrated high internal consistency (alphas = .65-.93) and high interrater reliability (ICCs = .81-.89). With regard to convergent and discriminant validity, we found high correlations between the CAPS severity score and both the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale sum score (r = .87) and the Beck Depression Inventory total score (r = .72). Regarding the underlying factor structure, the hybrid model demonstrated the best fit, followed by the anhedonia model. However, we encountered some nonpositive estimates for the correlations of the latent variables (factors) for both models. The model with the best fit without methodological problems was the externalizing behaviors model, but the results also supported the DSM-5 model. Overall, the results demonstrate that the German version of the CAPS-5 is a psychometrically sound measure.",0
"Parent trainings constitute an effective method to target aspects of parenting in child and adolescent psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care. Past research has mainly been conducted in outpatient contexts, with parents of children with externalizing disorders and often included only small sample sizes. The aim of the current study was first to assess the effectiveness of a novel parent training which is characterized by a universal approach, an open group concept, and short duration, and second to identify variables that have an influence on the effectiveness. A sample of n = 151 parent-child dyads treated in an inpatient clinic was included in the study and randomly assigned to a treatment group and a waiting-list control group. As dependent measures served child behavior problems, dysfunctional parenting, parental mental health, and parental self-efficacy measured with parent-rated questionnaires prior to the training, post training and 3 months after discharge of the clinic. Additionally, a parent-child-interaction observation was conducted and rated by blind raters. Results indicated a general inpatient treatment effect on all dependent measures assessed with questionnaires. An additional effect of the parent training was only shown for parenting and parental mental health with the treatment group revealing better outcomes post training and at follow-up. No effects were found for the measures assessed by interaction observation. Out of a number of variables, only a low monthly income was associated with a higher reduction of dysfunctional parenting. Results indicate that parent training does not contribute additionally to standard inpatient care with respect to child behavior, but does have an influence on parental well-being, which might have a positive effect on the long run.",0
"Emotion effects in event-related potentials (ERPs) during reading have been observed at very short latencies of around 100 to 200 ms after word onset. The nature of these effects remains a matter of debate: First, it is possible that they reflect semantic access, which might thus occur much faster than proposed by most reading models. Second, it is possible that associative learning of a word's shape might contribute to the emergence of emotion effects during visual processing. The present study addressed this question by employing an associative learning paradigm on pronounceable letter strings (pseudowords). In a learning session, letter strings were associated with positive, neutral, or negative valence by means of monetary gain, loss, or zero outcome. Crucially, half of the stimuli were learned in the visual modality, while the other half was presented acoustically, allowing for experimental separation of associated valence and physical percept. In a test session one or two days later, acquired letter strings were presented in an old/new decision task while we recorded ERPs. Behavioural data showed an advantage for gain-associated stimuli both during learning and in the delayed old/new task. Early emotion effects in ERPs were limited to visually acquired letter strings, but absent for acoustically acquired letter strings. These results imply that associative learning of a word's visual features might play an important role in the emergence of emotion effects at the stage of perceptual processing.",0
"Problems in infant mental health such as the ability to experience, regulate, and express emotional states is expressed in behavioral problems like excessive crying, feeding, and sleeping problems. Parenting programs are popular but their effectiveness on infant mental health remains uncertain. Possibly, because recent studies have focused only on parental and parent-child measures while they miss to assess infant behavioral measures. The goal of this pilot study is to fill in this gap by assessing infantile behavioral measures. We investigated the acceptance and first indicators of efficacy of the universal group parenting training Baby Triple P (BTP) compared to a care as usual (CAU) control condition focusing on early behavioral problems. In all, 49 couples were randomly allocated to receive either eight BTP sessions before birth and per telephone after birth or to take part in CAU. Infant behavior was assessed with a diary and a structured diagnostic interview. Parental self-report measures of partnership quality and parental competence were assessed before birth, 10 weeks after birth and at 6-month follow-up. Since the parent training was conducted before the birth of the child, the child's mental health could not be assessed before the parent training. Thus, for this variable no within measurement (pre-post) could be carried out and intention-to-treat analysis was not possible. However, a between group analysis comparing BTP against CAU took place to assess effectiveness of BTP on children's mental health. Mothers and fathers rated the program as feasible and relevant. Results indicate significant group differences in crying behavior 6 months after birth to the benefit of the intervention group. No beneficial outcomes were found for feeding and sleeping problems in infants or partnership quality, parental sense of competence in parents. Due to an unrepresentative high level of education of the participating parents and the small sample size, these findings can be considered preliminary. Nevertheless, these results allow to further investigate the effectivity of BTP in large-scale clinical trials. Behavioral diaries or diagnostic interviews for early mental health problems should be routinely implemented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in order not to miss possible behavioral changes in infants.

"OBJECTIVE: The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior posits that 2 proximal, causal, and interactive risk factors must be present for someone to desire suicide: perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the predictive power of these 2 risk factors in a prospective study. METHOD: A total of 231 adult outpatients (age: mean = 38.1, standard deviation = 12.3) undergoing cognitive-behavioral therapy took part in a pretreatment and a midtreatment assessment after the 10th therapy session. RESULTS: Perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and the interaction between these 2 risk factors did not add incremental variance to the prediction of midtreatment suicide ideation after controlling for age, gender, depression, hopelessness, impulsivity, lifetime suicide attempts, and pretreatment suicide ideation. The best predictor of midtreatment suicide ideation was pretreatment suicide ideation. CONCLUSION: Results offer only limited support to the assumptions of the interpersonal theory of suicide.",0
"Social exclusion affects mental and physical health. The ability to regulate emotional responses to social exclusion is therefore essential for our well-being. As individual differences in detecting bodily signals (interoceptive sensitivity, IS) have been associated with the ability of emotion regulation, we aimed at exploring whether IS fosters coping with social exclusion and flexibility in emotion regulation. The first study investigated subjective feelings and behavioral affiliation tendencies in response to ostracism using a cyberball paradigm. Sixty-nine participants were assessed who differed with respect to IS. The second study examined habitual emotion regulation processes focusing on suppression and reappraisal as well as IS in 116 participants. Main results were that the effect of ostracism on distress and behavioral affiliation tendencies were qualified by IS-being ostracized had less impact on participants with stronger IS. Furthermore, Study 2 revealed that IS was associated with habitually stronger emotion regulation strategies. We conclude that having access to bodily signals helps (IS) reducing aversive states provoked by social exclusion, probably due to the fact that IS is associated with emotion regulation strategies.",1
"Since the Covid-19 outbreak, addictive social media use increased in many countries. To better understand this development, a universal instrument for the assessment of addictive social media use is required. Against this background, we examined the psychometric properties of the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) in representative population samples in nine countries (N = 9418, age range: ""18 to 24 years"" (youngest group), ""55 years and older"" (oldest group): China, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Furthermore, we investigated potential factors and mechanisms that could be associated with addictive social media use. Our cross-national findings show that the BSMAS is a unidimensional reliable and valid instrument. Moreover, they reveal that the negative association between positive mental health and addictive social media use is mediated by sense of control in seven of the nine countries (exception: China, Russia). Thus, it can be hypothesized that activities which increase positive mental health could indirectly contribute to the decrease of addictive social media use. We identified conscious engagement in physical activity and a regular sleep rhythm during the pandemic as such potential activities. The fostering of both by governmental programs could enhance positive mental health and reduce addictive social media use.",1
"BACKGROUND: A common screening instrument for substance use disorders (SUDs) is the Drug Use Disorders Identification Test (DUDIT) which includes a short form regarding only drug consumption (DUDIT-C). We aim to assess if a German version of the DUDIT, adapted for adolescents, is a suitable screening instrument in a sample of adolescent psychiatric patients. METHODS: N = 124 (54 female) German adolescent (M = 15.6 + 1.5 years) psychiatric patients completed the DUDIT and received a diagnostic interview (MINI-KID) assessing DSM-5 SUD criteria. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the area under the curve (AUC), and Youden's Index were calculated. RESULTS: A two-factor model of the DUDIT shows the best model fit (CFI = 0.995, SRMR = 0.055, RMSEA = 0.059, WRMR = 0.603). The DUDIT as well as the DUDIT-C show high diagnostic accuracy, with AUC = 0.95 and AUC = 0.88, respectively. For the DUDIT a cut-off value of 8.5 was optimal (sensitivity = 0.93, specificity = 0.91, J = 0.84), while for the DUDIT-C the optimal cut-off value was at 1.5 (sensitivity = 0.86, specificity = 0.84, J = 0.70). CONCLUSION: This is the first psychometric evaluation of the DUDIT in German, adolescent psychiatric outpatients, using the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The DUDIT as well as the DUDIT-C are well suited for use in this population. Since in our sample only few patients presented with a mild or moderate SUD, our results need to be replicated in a sample of adolescents with mild SUD.",1
"OBJECTIVE: Thus far, most applications in precision mental health have not been evaluated prospectively. This article presents the results of a prospective randomized-controlled trial investigating the effects of a digital decision support and feedback system, which includes two components of patient-specific recommendations: (a) a clinical strategy recommendation and (b) adaptive recommendations for patients at risk for treatment failure. METHOD: Therapist-patient dyads (N = 538) in a cognitive behavioral therapy outpatient clinic were randomized to either having access to a decision support system (intervention group; n = 335) or not (treatment as usual; n = 203). First, treatment strategy recommendations (problem-solving, motivation-oriented, or a mix of both strategies) for the first 10 sessions were evaluated. Second, the effect of psychometric feedback enhanced with clinical problem-solving tools on treatment outcome was investigated. RESULTS: The prospective evaluation showed a differential effect size of about 0.3 when therapists followed the recommended treatment strategy in the first 10 sessions. Moreover, the linear mixed models revealed therapist symptom awareness and therapist attitude and confidence as significant predictors of an outcome as well as therapist-rated usefulness of feedback as a significant moderator of the feedback-outcome and the not on track-outcome associations. However, no main effects were found for feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the importance of prospective studies and the high-quality implementation of digital decision support tools in clinical practice. Therapists seem to be able to learn from such systems and incorporate them into their clinical practice to enhance patient outcomes, but only when implementation is successful.

"OBJECTIVES: Recent work suggests that a genetic variation associated with increased dopamine metabolism in the prefrontal cortex (catechol-O-methyltransferase Val158Met; COMT) amplifies age-related changes in working memory performance. Research on younger adults indicates that the influence of dopamine-related genetic polymorphisms on working memory performance increases when testing the cognitive limits through training. To date, this has not been studied in older adults. METHOD: Here we investigate the effect of COMT genotype on plasticity in working memory in a sample of 14 younger (aged 24-30 years) and 25 older (aged 60-75 years) healthy adults. Participants underwent adaptive training in the n-back working memory task over 12 sessions under increasing difficulty conditions. RESULTS: Both younger and older adults exhibited sizeable behavioral plasticity through training (P < .001), which was larger in younger as compared to older adults (P < .001). Age-related differences were qualified by an interaction with COMT genotype (P < .001), and this interaction was due to decreased behavioral plasticity in older adults carrying the Val/Val genotype, while there was no effect of genotype in younger adults. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that age-related changes in plasticity in working memory are critically affected by genetic variation in prefrontal dopamine metabolism.",0
"BACKGROUND: Current treatments of obesity often fail to consider gender and psychological aspects, which are essential for weight loss and weight maintenance. The aim of our study was to analyze subjective illness representations (SIRs) of adults with obesity according to the Common-Sense Self-Regulation Model (CSM) by assessing their associations with weight-related variables and gender. METHODS: Data was collected via online self-assessment between April 2017 and March 2018. SIRs were operationalized by the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) and illness outcomes according to the CSM were defined as BMI, eating behaviour, physical wellbeing, bodyweight satisfaction, and shape concerns. The sample consisted of 427 adults (M = 42.2 years, SD = 10.9; 82% female) with obesity (BMI: M = 42.3 kg/m(2), SD = 9.0). Student's t-tests and multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted with the control variables (age and BMI) and subjective illness representations and gender as independent variables. RESULTS: The explanation of outcome variances was moderate to high (21-43%) except for restraint eating behaviour (10%). Subjective illness representations showed several significant associations with weight-related variables, especially timeline and emotional representations. Female gender was significantly associated with more restraint eating behaviour [F ((1, 400)) = 4.19, p < 0.001] and females had unfavourable values of the weight-related variables as well as a more cyclic [t ((425)) = 3.68, p < 0.001], and more emotional representation [t ((100)) = 5.17, p < 0.001] of their obesity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that gender and subjective illness representations, especially the emotional representation, play an important role for weight-related variables. Therefore, the assessment of SIRs may constitute an economic tool to identify specific individual deficits of self-regulation.",1
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: One of the central assumptions of cognitive models of Panic Disorder (PD) is that automatic panic-related associations are a core feature of PD. However, empirical findings are mixed and inconsistent, rendering it difficult to evaluate the role of panic-related associations adequately, particularly in relation to the relevant theories. The present study aimed to further advance our understanding of automatic associations in PD, and therefore applied a paradigm novel in this context, namely an Extrinsic Affective Simon Task (EAST). METHODS: Participants involved treatment seeking, unmedicated panic patients (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 38). The EAST was applied prior to treatment. It included the following stimuli as targets: panic-related bodily sensations and agoraphobia-related situations, and as attributes: pleasant versus unpleasant, fear-related words. RESULTS: Contrary to our expectations, panic patients did not show stronger negative than positive automatic associations for either panic-related symptoms or agoraphobia-related situations, compared to healthy controls. Moreover, EAST effects did not correlate with panic-related self-report measures. LIMITATIONS: Although the present study involved patients who were actively seeking treatment, panic-related associations might not have been activated sufficiently. Hence, a brief activation procedure (e.g., hyperventilation) might have been needed to optimize the assessment condition. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings do not support contemporary theories of panic-related associations. Therefore, follow-up work is needed to disentangle their functional and operational properties more thoroughly.",0
"BACKGROUND: Reduced sensitivity to rewards as well as the tendency to maintain dysfunctional expectations despite expectation-disconfirming evidence (cognitive immunization) are considered core features of various mental disorders. It is therefore important for clinical research to have paradigms that are suitable to study these phenomena. We developed a new experimental paradigm to study explicit expectation change after prior expectation induction and violation. Its validity is tested by applying the paradigm to healthy individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the main part of the study (experiment 1) we examined whether it is possible to change healthy individuals' (Sample size 56) task-specific and generalized performance expectations through expectation-disconfirming experiences. We used a high-difficulty performance task to induce initially negative expectations regarding participants' ability to successfully work on that unknown task. In the second part of the study, the difficulty of the test was lowered in one experimental condition, in order to disconfirm the negative expectations of the first part, while the other group continued with high test difficulty to confirm the negative expectations. We measured the participant's explicit performance expectations before and after completing the tests. In experiment 2 (Sample size 57), we investigated the impact of different test instructions on expectation change. Using the same paradigm as in experiment 1, we added an ""immunization-inhibiting"" manipulation for one group and an ""immunization-enhancing"" manipulation for the other group. RESULTS: In experiment 1, we were able to show that individuals changed their expectations according to variations of task difficulty. Adding instructions to manipulate cognitive immunization inhibited expectation change regardless of condition (experiment 2). CONCLUSION: Our approach allowed us to examine the effects of implicitly acquired performance expectations on explicit, verbalized expectation change. The new experimental paradigm used in this study is suitable to induce performance expectations, and to examine expectation-change among healthy individuals (experiment 1). Instructions to enhance or inhibit cognitive immunization processes both inhibited expectation change (experiment 2). The results are discussed within the context of current models of expectation change, cognitive immunization, and reward sensitivity.",1
"BACKGROUND: Women with a history of childhood maltreatment (CM) experience the postpartum period as particularly stressful and may benefit less from social support, implicating a higher risk for mental health problems and higher stress levels in mothers with CM. OBJECTIVE: Thus, we investigated the complex relationship of CM and social support provided by different sources (intimate partner, parents, parents-in-law, friends) in predicting stress perception and mental health over the course of the first year postpartum. PARTICIPANTS: In N = 295 postpartum women we assessed CM experiences, stress perception, perceived social support and general mental health 3 and 12 months postpartum. METHOD: Linear mixed effect models were used to examine the course of social support over the first year postpartum and path analyses were used to investigate mediation and moderation effects. RESULTS: We found that CM was linked to lower levels of perceived social support, accounted for more mental health problems, and amplified the negative association between perceived stress and maternal mental health. Most importantly, we showed that only partner support was beneficial for maternal mental health, and this association was mediated by reductions in perceived stress. CONCLUSION: CM as a major risk factor for mental health impairs the stress resilience of affected postpartum women. Extending previous research, our results reveal that the source of postpartum social support determines its benefits for maternal health. Our findings emphasize the need of at-risk mothers to be provided with additional sources of support to cope with daily practical, organizational and emotional challenges.",1
"BACKGROUND: While the efficacy of Internet interventions for depression has been demonstrated in numerous studies, there is concern that the participants in these studies may systematically differ from depressed subjects in the general population. The goal of this study was to compare participants in a large trial of an Internet intervention for depression with a population-based sample that reported depressive symptomatology in the same range of severity. METHODOLOGY: The analysis is based on a sample of participants of a randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of an Internet intervention for depression in mild to moderate depression (EVIDENT, N = 1013) and a subsample of participants in a representative population-based sample (DEGS1, n = 1978). The DEGS1 subsample was chosen based on the score in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9, score 5-14) as this was the main inclusion criterion for the EVIDENT study. Both samples were compared with respect to a range of demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS: Compared with the DEGS1 subsample, participants in the EVIDENT sample were significantly more often female (68.6% vs. 56.3%), slightly older (mean age 42.9 vs. 40.4 years), had more often completed highest secondary education (51.3% vs. 22.4%), were clinically more severely affected (moderate depressive symptoms in 62.6% vs. 18.3%) and reported a lower quality of life. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that participants in this Internet trial were not just internet savvy young males without significant impairment. Future studies should aim to recruit participants with lower educational status to increase the reach of Internet interventions.",1

"OBJECTIVE: Disturbances in emotional processes are commonly reported in patients with a somatic symptom disorder (SSD). Although emotions usually occur in social interactions, little is known about interpersonal emotion dynamics of SSD patients during their actual emotional encounters. This study examined physiological coherence (linkage) between SSD patients and their partners, and in healthy couples during their emotional interactions. Secondarily, we explored group-level relationships between participants' and their partners' subjective affect. METHODS: Twenty-nine romantic couples (16 healthy and 13 SSD patient-couples) underwent a dyadic conversation task with neutral and anger-eliciting topics followed by a guided relaxation. Partners' cutaneous facial temperature was recorded simultaneously by functional infrared thermal imaging. Immediately after each condition, participants reported on their pain intensity, self-affect, and perceived partner-affect. RESULTS: Emotional conditions and having a partner with an SSD significantly affected coherence amplitude on the forehead (F(2,54) = 4.95, p = .011) and nose tip temperature (F(2,54) = 3.75, p = .030). From baseline to anger condition, coherence amplitude significantly increased in the patient-couples, whereas it decreased in the healthy couples. Correlation changes between partners' subjective affect comparably accompanied the changes in physiological coherence in healthy and patient-couples. CONCLUSIONS: Inability to reduce emotional interdependence in sympathetic activity and subjective affect during a mutual conflict observed in SSD patient-couples seems to capture emotion co-dysregulation. Interventions should frame patients' emotional experiences as embodied and social. Functional infrared thermal imaging confirms to be an ecological and reliable method for examining autonomic changes in interpersonal contexts.Registration Page: https://osf.io/8eyjr.",1
"The early processing of visual sexual stimuli shows signs of automaticity. Moreover, there is evidence for sex-specific patterns in cognitive and physiological responding to erotica. However, little is known about the time course of rapid pupillary responses to sexual stimuli and their correspondence with other measures of autonomic activity in women and men. To study pupil dilation as an implicit measure of sexual arousal at various stages of picture processing, we presented 35 heterosexual participants with pictures showing either erotic couples or single (male/female) erotic nudes, contrasted with people involved in everyday situations. Brightness-adjusted grayscale pictures were shown for a duration of 2,500 ms within the central visual field, alternating with perceptually matched patches. Left pupil diameter was recorded at 500 Hz using a video-based eye tracker. Skin conductance and heart rate were coregistered and correlated with latent components of pupil dilation (dissociated by temporal PCA). Whereas stimulus-evoked changes in pupil size indicated virtually no initial constriction, a rapid effect of appetence emerged (dilation to erotica within 500 ms). Responses at early stages of processing were remarkably consistent across both sexes. In contrast, later phases of pupil dilation, subjective ratings, and skin conductance responses showed a sex-specific pattern. Moreover, evidence for an association of early-onset pupil dilation and heart rate acceleration was found, suggestive of parasympathetic inhibition, whereas the late component was mainly related to sympathetically mediated skin conductance. Taken together, our results indicate that different temporal components of pupil responses to erotic stimuli may reflect divergent underlying neural mechanisms.",1
"Hyperactive error monitoring is a robust neurocognitive characteristic in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, relatively little is known about the flexibility and potential moderators of error monitoring in OCD. The current study investigates error monitoring in 30 healthy participants and 28 patients with OCD using a flanker task in 2 conditions either emphasizing speed or accuracy. Results indicate that no group difference is observable in error-related negativity (ERN) under the accuracy-focused condition. Both groups show an ERN attenuation in the speed condition; however, this reduction is larger in healthy controls leading to pronounced group differences in the speed-focused condition. Similarly, receiver operating characteristic analyses yield an area under the curve (AUC) of .62 in the accuracy-focused condition, whereas under speed instruction an AUC of .85 suggests a marked increase in classification accuracy. Behavioral results and results from a drift-diffusion model of decision making indicate a more cautious response strategy and less adaptability to experimental manipulations in OCD. Overall, results suggest that the observed increases in error-related neural activity in OCD might stem from a reduced flexibility and diminished ability to disengage from an accuracy-oriented, error-avoidant response style. Further, the present results suggest that emphasizing speed in experimental instructions may lead to a better neural differentiation between patients with OCD and healthy controls which has important implications for the use of the ERN as a risk indicator.

"BACKGROUND: During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, about a quarter of the population died, resulting in many individuals losing close relatives. Still today, many individuals are suffering from the psychological consequences of these losses, which might also affect the process of reconciliation within the Cambodian society. The aim of this paper is therefore to investigate the association between symptoms of prolonged grief and attitudes toward reconciliation. METHODS: A sample of 775 survivors of the Khmer Rouge regime who lost relatives during the conflict were interviewed about their losses and traumatic events, prolonged grief (PG; Complicated Grief Assessment Self-Report, CGA-SR), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version) and attitudes toward reconciliation (Readiness to Reconcile Inventory, RRI). RESULTS: A higher symptom severity of PG was significantly associated with readiness to reconcile even when controlling for other relevant variables (beta = -0.22; p <.001). Persons who met caseness criteria for PG were significantly less ready to reconcile, t(773) = 5.47, p <.001, than persons who did not meet caseness for PG. CONCLUSION: PG seems to be a relevant mental health correlate of attitudes toward reconciliation. The results of the current study underline the importance of also considering PG with regard to the reconciliation process in Cambodia and possibly also in other post-conflict regions.",1
"Affective touch plays an important role in children's social interaction and is involved in shaping the development of the social brain. The positive affective component of touch is thought to be conveyed via a group of unmyelinated, low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents, known as C-tactile fibers that are optimally activated by gentle, slow, stroking touch. Touch targeting these C-tactile fibers has been shown to decrease the heart rate in infants. The current study investigated the relationship between age and psychophysical ratings in response to affective touch. A total of n=43 participants (early childhood: aged 5-8 years, 9 girls, 12 boys; late childhood: aged 9-12 years, 12 girls, 10 boys) were presented with C-tactile optimal and sub-optimal stroking velocities and rated touch pleasantness on an affective pictorial scale. For both age groups, we found that children preferred C-tactile-targeted stimulation. A comparison with previously published data showed that the children's preference for C-tactile-targeted stimulation was similar to those obtained in adolescents and adults. We speculate that the effect of C-tactile-targeted touch, which is linked with pleasantness, shapes the children's preference for C-tactile over non-C-tactile-targeted stimulation, and that C-tactile afferent stimulation is important for social development.",1
"There are large health, societal, and economic costs associated with attrition from psychological services. The recently emerged, innovative statistical tool of complex network analysis was used in the present proof-of-concept study to improve the prediction of attrition. Fifty-eight patients undergoing psychological treatment for mood or anxiety disorders were assessed using Ecological Momentary Assessments four times a day for two weeks before treatment (3,248 measurements). Multilevel vector autoregressive models were employed to compute dynamic symptom networks. Intake variables and network parameters (centrality measures) were used as predictors for dropout using machine-learning algorithms. Networks for patients differed significantly between completers and dropouts. Among intake variables, initial impairment and sex predicted dropout explaining 6% of the variance. The network analysis identified four additional predictors: Expected force of being excited, outstrength of experiencing social support, betweenness of feeling nervous, and instrength of being active. The final model with the two intake and four network variables explained 32% of variance in dropout and identified 47 out of 58 patients correctly. The findings indicate that patients' dynamic network structures may improve the prediction of dropout. When implemented in routine care, such prediction models could identify patients at risk for attrition and inform personalized treatment recommendations.",1
"Extinction learning is considered an important underlying process of successful treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, sleep disturbances may impede this learning process: Current accounts postulate that sleep facilitates encoding by promoting neural plasticity during slow wave sleep (SWS). Based on this hypothesis, we tested whether early night sleep, with high amounts of SWS, facilitates subsequent extinction learning and recall. Sixty-three participants took part in a trauma-adapted fear conditioning experiment. One group received a three-hour sleep opportunity in the early night half, whereas the other group stayed awake. Thereafter, both groups underwent extinction training and a return-of-fear test. Retention was assessed after another sleep opportunity in both groups. Linear mixed-effects models and Bayesian inference did not support the hypothesis of strengthened fear extinction by prior early night sleep. Subsequent exploratory analyses, in contrast, point to a role of rapid eye movement sleep in promoting successful fear extinction learning. Further confirmatory research should re-investigate these effects and their implications for the treatment of PTSD.",0
"BACKGROUND: The assessment of therapeutic adherence and competence is essential to understand mechanisms that contribute to treatment outcome. Nevertheless, their assessment is often neglected in psychotherapy research. AIMS/OBJECTIVE: To develop an adherence and a treatment-specific competence rating scale for Dialectical Behaviour Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (DBT-PTSD), and to examine their psychometric properties. Global cognitive behavioural therapeutic competence and disorder-specific therapeutic competence were assessed using already existing scales to confirm their psychometric properties in our sample of patients with PTSD and emotion regulation difficulties. METHOD: Two rating scales were developed using an inductive procedure. 155 videotaped therapy sessions from a multicenter randomised controlled trial were rated by trained raters using these scales, 40 randomly chosen videotapes involving eleven therapists and fourteen patients were doubly rated by two raters. RESULTS: Both the adherence scale (Patient-level ICC = .98; alpha(s )= .65; alpha (p)( )= .75) and the treatment-specific competence scale (Patient-level ICC = .98; alpha(s )= .78; alpha (p)( )= .82) for DBT-PTSD showed excellent interrater - and good reliability on the patient level. Content validity, including relevance and appropriateness of all items, was confirmed by experts in DBT-PTSD for the new treatment-specific competence scale. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that both scales are reliable instruments. They will be useful to examine possible effects of adherence and treatment-specific competence on DBT-PTSD treatment outcome.",1
"The development of eating disorders is associated with a body-related attentional bias. Although eating disorders are especially prevalent in adolescence, so far, no study has analyzed gaze patterns and state body image in response to viewing one's own body in youth. To fill this gap, the present study aimed to examine a body-related attentional bias and state body satisfaction in adolescents with various forms of eating disorders. Girls with anorexia nervosa, restrictive type (AN-R; n = 30), anorexia nervosa, binge eating/purging type (AN-BP; n = 26), bulimia nervosa (BN; n = 22), clinical controls with anxiety disorders (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 43) looked at photographs of their own and a peer's body, while their spontaneous eye movements were recorded. After stimulus presentation, state body satisfaction and individual attractiveness ratings for areas of the presented stimuli were assessed. An analysis of variance revealed that participants of all subgroups showed an attentive preference for unattractive areas of one's own body. Girls with AN-R attended significantly longer to unattractive body areas than both control groups and significantly shorter to attractive body areas than healthy controls. State body dissatisfaction was more prominent in all eating disorder subgroups, with significantly lower scores in BN compared to AN-R. In general, the higher the state body dissatisfaction, the stronger was the deficit orientation on one's own body. The attentional bias towards unattractive body areas, which is most pronounced in AN-R, indicates that interventions aiming to modify distorted attention might be promising in the prevention and treatment of eating disorders in adolescence.",1
"Testosterone has been linked to alterations in the activity of emotion neurocircuitry including amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and insula and diminished functional amygdala/prefrontal coupling. Such associations have only ever been studied using acute measures of testosterone, thus little is known about respective relationships with long-term testosterone secretion. Here, we examine associations between hair testosterone concentration (HTC), an index of long-term cumulative testosterone levels and neural reactivity during an emotional passive viewing task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Forty-six men viewed negative, positive and neutral pictures in the MRI. HTCs were assessed from 2 cm hair segments. The emotional paradigm elicited neural activation in the amygdala, insula and OFC. HTCs were associated with increased reactivity to negative pictures in the insula and increased reactivity to positive pictures in the OFC. We show an association of long-term testosterone levels with increased emotional reactivity in the brain. These results suggest a heightened emotional vigilance in individuals with high trait testosterone levels.",1
"AIM: Suicide ideation has increased since the outbreak of Covid-19 in many countries. The present longitudinal study investigated potential predictors of suicide ideation. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Data of 406 participants from Germany (age M = 27.69, SD = 6.88) were assessed via online surveys in spring 2020 (baseline, BL) and in spring 2021 (follow-up, FU). RESULTS: The current results reveal a significant increase in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress between 2020 and 2021. Positive mental health (PMH), sense of control, and physical health significantly decreased. Depression symptoms (BL), PMH (BL), and consciously enhanced physical activity since the pandemic outbreak (FU) significantly predicted 12-month suicide ideation (FU). In a moderated mediation analysis, the positive relationship between depression and suicide ideation was significantly mediated by PMH. Consciously enhanced physical activity significantly moderated the negative association between PMH and suicide ideation. CONCLUSION: The context of Covid-19 could negatively impact mental health and physical health. This might increase the risk for suicide ideation. However, PMH and physical activity might serve as protective factors. The protective effect of physical activity could be especially important in people with high depression symptoms and low PMH, such as clinical patients. Potential ways of how PMH and physical activity could be enhanced in the Covid-19 context to prevent suicide ideation are discussed.",1
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Attentional biases (AB) for trauma-related stimuli have been examined in many studies assessing different trauma samples. In emotional Stroop tasks (EST), blocked and single-trial formats are used almost interchangeably in clinical research. There is reason to believe that different designs yield different results and assess different processes, which, however, has been hardly examined in studies. Furthermore, there is a dearth of information about AB in older trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress symptoms. METHODS: Older adults with (n = 20) and without PTSD symptoms (n = 26) as well as non-traumatized controls (n = 21) completed an EST, in which words were presented both blocked and randomized. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that individuals with PTSD symptoms showed AB for trauma- and depression-related words; however, mode of administration did not significantly influence reaction times. LIMITATIONS: The emotional Stroop task cannot disentangle the underlying cognitive mechanism (i.e., facilitation, interference, avoidance). CONCLUSIONS: PTSD symptoms in older trauma survivors are associated with AB. Overall, participants with PTSD symptoms did not show greater impairment of cognitive control in comparison to both control groups. Results also illustrate that methodological differences between task versions need to be considered more thoroughly.",0
"BACKGROUND: While some intervention trials have demonstrated efficacy in treating prolonged grief disorder (PGD), data on long-term treatment effects are scarce. METHODS: Fifty-one outpatients with clinically relevant prolonged grief symptoms, who had participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), were followed up, on average, 1.5 years after integrative cognitive behavioral therapy for PGD (PG-CBT). Initial assessment procedures were repeated, with PGD symptom severity as the main outcome and general mental health symptoms as secondary outcomes. As results in the immediate and delayed treatment groups (former wait list) were similar, the follow-up data were pooled. RESULTS: Overall, 80% of the original ITT sample could be reached, that is 89% of the 37 treated participants, as well as 8 out of 14 participants who had dropped out of the RCT. The considerable short-term treatment success of PG-CBT was stable; pre to follow-up Cohen׳s d was large, with 1.24 in the ITT analysis and 2.22 for completers. The pre to post-improvement in overall mental health was maintained. LIMITATIONS: Since the RCT wait list group had been treated after their waiting period as well, no controlled long-term outcomes are available. CONCLUSIONS: PG-CBT proved to be effective in the longer run. In comparison to other RCTs on prolonged grief this is the largest sample followed up for this long.",1
"BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with a chronic medical condition show an increased risk for developing mental comorbidities compared to their healthy peers. Internet- and mobile-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) might be a low-threshold treatment to support affected AYA. In this randomized controlled pilot trial, the feasibility and potential efficacy of youthCOACH(CD), an iCBT targeting symptoms of anxiety and depression in AYA with chronic medical conditions, was evaluated. METHODS: A total of 30 AYA (M(age) 16.13; SD= 2.34; 73% female), aged 12-21 years either suffering from cystic fibrosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis or type 1 diabetes, were randomly assigned to either a guided version of the iCBT youthCOACH(CD) (IG, n=15) or to a waitlist control group (CG, n=15), receiving an unguided version of the iCBT six months post-randomization. Participants of the IG and the CG were assessed before (t0), twelve weeks after (t1) and six months after (t2) randomization. Primary outcome was the feasibility of the iCBT. Different parameters of feasibility e.g. acceptance, client satisfaction or potential side effects were evaluated. First indications of the possible efficacy with regard to the primary efficacy outcome, the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale, and further outcome variables were evaluated using linear regression models, adjusting for baseline values. RESULTS: Regarding feasibility, intervention completion was 60%; intervention satisfaction (M = 25.42, SD = 5.85) and perceived therapeutic alliance (M = 2.83, SD = 1.25) were moderate and comparable to other iCBTs. No patterns emerged regarding subjective and objective negative side effects due to participation in youthCOACH(CD). Estimates of potential efficacy showed between group differences, with a potential medium-term benefit of youthCOACH(CD) (beta = -0.55, 95%CI: -1.17; 0.07), but probably not short-term (beta = 0.20, 95%CI: -0.47; 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to the feasibility of youthCOACH(CD) and the implementation of a future definitive randomized controlled trial addressing its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Due to the small sample size, conclusions are premature, however, further strategies to foster treatment adherence should be considered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Trials Register (ID: DRKS00016714 , 25/03/2019).",1
"The present study examines the interplay between cognitive deficits and emotional context in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia (SP). Specifically, this study examines whether the inflexible use of efficient learning strategies in an emotional context underlies impairments in probabilistic classification learning (PCL) in OCD, and whether PCL impairments are specific to OCD. Twenty-three participants with OCD, 30 participants with SP and 30 healthy controls completed a neutral and an OCD-specific PCL task. OCD participants failed to adopt efficient learning strategies and showed fewer beneficial strategy switches than controls only in an OCD-specific context, but not in a neutral context. Additionally, OCD participants did not show any explicit memory impairments. Number of beneficial strategy switches in the OCD-specific task mediated the difference in PCL performance between OCD and control participants. Individuals with SP were impaired in both PCL tasks. In contrast to neuropsychological models postulating general cognitive impairments in OCD, the present findings suggest that it is the interaction between cognition and emotion that is impaired in OCD. Specifically, activated disorder-specific fears may impair the flexible adoption of efficient learning strategies and compromise otherwise unimpaired PCL. Impairments in PCL are not specific to OCD.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Imaginal retraining is a self-help technique that adapts the principles of approach bias modification to the imagination. Imaginal retraining has been shown to reduce craving and addictive behaviours in 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on problematic alcohol consumption, overweight, and tobacco use. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the long-term efficacy of the intervention. The aim of the present study was to generate first hypotheses on the long-term efficacy of imaginal retraining in smokers in a controlled 1-year follow-up study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recontacted the 345 participants who had taken part in an RCT on imaginal retraining for smokers 1 year later. The survey was carried out online and assessed craving for tobacco (primary outcome), smoking behaviour, well-being, and subjective appraisal. Individuals who applied the technique at least once during the previous year were categorized as the training group, whereas participants who never performed the training were categorized as the no-training group. Data were analysed using linear mixed models (LMMs). The study was preregistered as DRKS00021044. RESULTS: The completion rate was 45.5%. Less than 40% used the intervention at least once in the previous 12 months. LMM analyses showed a significant reduction in craving for tobacco for the training compared to the no-training group after 1 year. No significant group differences emerged in smoking behaviour, depressive symptoms, or quality of life. Subjective appraisal of the intervention was favorable, similar to the initial study. CONCLUSION: The present study provides preliminary support for the long-term efficacy of imaginal retraining on craving for tobacco but not on smoking behaviour, highlighting the importance of multimodal treatment concepts in smoking cessation that target a variety of maintaining factors. Future studies need to investigate the long-term efficacy of the intervention in prospective RCTs that test alternative ways of conveying the technique to improve adherence.",0
"OBJECTIVES: Transportation of goods on railways is increasing and the majority of the increased numbers of freight trains run during the night. Transportation noise has adverse effects on sleep structure, affects the heart rate (HR) during sleep and may be linked to cardiovascular disease. Freight trains also generate vibration and little is known regarding the impact of vibration on human sleep. A laboratory study was conducted to examine how a realistic nocturnal railway traffic scenario influences HR during sleep. DESIGN: Case-control. SETTING: Healthy participants. PARTICIPANTS: 24 healthy volunteers (11 men, 13 women, 19-28 years) spent six consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. INTERVENTIONS: All participants slept during one habituation night, one control and four experimental nights in which train noise and vibration were reproduced. In the experimental nights, 20 or 36 trains with low-vibration or high-vibration characteristics were presented. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Polysomnographical data and ECG were recorded. RESULTS: The train exposure led to a significant change of HR within 1 min of exposure onset (p=0.002), characterised by an initial and a delayed increase of HR. The high-vibration condition provoked an average increase of at least 3 bpm per train in 79% of the participants. Cardiac responses were in general higher in the high-vibration condition than in the low-vibration condition (p=0.006). No significant effect of noise sensitivity and gender was revealed, although there was a tendency for men to exhibit stronger HR acceleration than women. CONCLUSIONS: Freight trains provoke HR accelerations during sleep, and the vibration characteristics of the trains are of special importance. In the long term, this may affect cardiovascular functioning of persons living close to railways.",0
"Mindfulness-based interventions are effective at improving symptoms of sexual dysfunction in women. The mechanisms by which mindfulness improves sexual function are less clear. The main objective of our study was to investigate the impact of a mindfulness task on sexual response in women. Forty-one women (mean age = 27.2, SD = 5.6) participated in two laboratory sessions that each included two erotic films and one attention task that were presented in counterbalanced order. Both attention tasks consisted of a six-minute audio recording of either a modified body scan, focusing on genital arousal sensations (mindfulness condition), or a visualization exercise. Subjective and genital sexual arousal were measured continuously during stimulus presentation. The mindfulness task led to greater subjective and lower genital arousal. The agreement of subjective and genital sexual arousal (i.e., concordance) was greater in the mindfulness condition. Trait mindfulness was related to lower sexual arousal but also greater sexual concordance in women. Mindfulness-based interventions that encourage women to focus on physical arousal sensations in the here and now may be associated with women's improved sexual function by enhancing feelings of sexual arousal during sexual activity and by increasing concordance between subjective and genital sexual arousal.",1
"Background: Enhanced self-focused attention plays a central role in the maintenance and treatment of Social Anxiety and is targeted in contemporary cognitive behavioral therapy. Actual developments use Virtual Reality (VR) for behavioral training. However, no VR attention training combining exposure to public speaking with shifting attention from self-focus to external focus has been investigated, and no experimental evidence exists on different kinds of external cues as targets of attention. Therefore, we investigated the effects of an attention training during public speaking in VR and examined differential effects of an external focus on nonsocial vs. social stimuli. Methods: In this randomized controlled study, highly socially anxious participants were instructed to focus on either objects or the audience within a virtual speech task. We assessed the pre-post effects on affective reactions, self-perception, and attentional processes during public speaking as well as general Social Anxiety using subjective, physiological, and eye-tracking measures. Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were calculated to detect changes from pretest to posttest over both groups, and time x group interaction effects. Results: Within the analysis sample (n = 41), anxiety during public speaking and fear of negative evaluation significantly decreased, with no significant differences between groups. No significant time effect, but a significant time x group effect, was found for the looking time proportion on the audience members' heads. Follow-up tests confirmed a significant increase in the social-focus group and a significant decrease in the nonsocial-focus group. For all other variables, except external focus and fear of public speaking, significant improvements were found over both groups. Further significant time x group effects were found for positive affect during public speaking, with a significant increase in the social focus, and no significant change in the nonsocial-focus group. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that attention training to reduce self-focus can be successfully conducted in VR. Both training versions showed positive short-term effects in the highly socially anxious, with particular advantages of an external social focus concerning eye contact to the audience and positive affect. Further research should investigate whether social focus is even more advantageous long term and if reinterpretations of dysfunctional beliefs could be achieved by not avoiding social cues.",0
"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused high psychological burden for many people. Some people tend to excessive social media use (SMU) to escape the negative emotions which can foster addictive tendencies. The present study investigated positive mental health (PMH) and mindfulness as protective factors that could reduce the risk for addictive SMU. Data of 1,049 participants from Germany were assessed via online surveys in autumn 2021. The current results reveal a positive relationship between COVID-19 burden and addictive SMU. Both were negatively linked to PMH and mindfulness. In a moderated mediation analysis, the relationship between COVID-19 burden and addictive SMU was mediated by PMH. Mindfulness moderated the association between PMH and addictive SMU. The COVID-19 situation can be burdensome and contribute to dysfunctional coping strategies such as addictive SMU. However, PMH and mindfulness serve as protective factors. The protective effect of mindfulness could be especially important for persons with low PMH.",1
"OBJECTIVE: There is little evidence-based knowledge of how psychotherapists should handle both sudden gains and more gradual session-by-session changes, either in general or in individuals suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. METHODS: Using an ABAB crossed-therapist randomized clinical implementation trial design (N = 80 patients and 20 therapists), we contrasted a Prolonged Focus on Change (PFC, N = 40) implementation with a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA, N = 40) implementation. Both implementations were based on a widely used cognitive behavioral therapy approach (Mastery of your Anxiety and Worry package) with the only difference that in the PFC implementation, the therapists were instructed to systematically explore eventual changes at the beginning of the therapy sessions. RESULTS: Based on a 3-level hierarchical linear model, PFC implementation showed faster symptom reduction in worry over therapy (i.e., linear change) and a decelerated (quadratic) change until 12-month follow-up in comparison to the SOTA implementation. CONCLUSION: These findings provide clinically useful information about potential short-term and long-term effects of exploring occurring change in GAD populations. Randomized clinical implementation trial designs are a step forward allowing to experimentally investigate basic psychotherapeutic strategies in process-based psychotherapy.

"BACKGROUND: Communicating a diagnosis is highly important, yet complex, especially in the context of cancer and mental disorders. The aim was to explore the communication style of an oncologist vs. psychotherapist in an online study. METHODS: Patients (N = 136: 65 cancer, 71 depression) were randomly assigned to watch a standardized video vignette with one of two communication styles (empathic vs. unempathic). Outcome measures of affectivity, information recall, communication skills, empathy and trust were applied. RESULTS: Regardless of diagnosis, empathic communication was associated with the perception of a significantly more empathic (p < 0.001, etapartial2 = 0.08) and trustworthy practitioner (p = 0.014, etapartial2 = 0.04) with better communication skills (p = 0.013, etapartial2 = 0.05). Cancer patients reported a larger decrease in positive affect (p < 0.001, etapartial2 = 0.15) and a larger increase in negative affect (p < 0.001, etapartial2 = 0.14) from pre- to post-video than depressive patients. Highly relevant information was recalled better in both groups (p < 0.001, d = 0.61-1.06). CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of empathy while communicating both a diagnosis of cancer and a mental disorder. Further research should focus on the communication of a mental disorder in association with cancer.",1
"Animals and humans are able to inhibit pain by activating their endogenous pain-inhibition system. Endurance athletes possess a higher pain-tolerance threshold and a greater conditioned pain modulation (CPM) effect than nonathletes, suggesting better endogenous pain inhibition. In addition to CPM, placebo is another prominent paradigm used to test endogenous pain inhibition. However, whether the placebo effect and the CPM effect share the same mechanisms of pain inhibition has not been investigated. If there is a shared mechanism, then endurance athletes should show not only a better CPM effect than nonathletes but also a greater placebo effect. Here, we investigated 16 male endurance athletes and 17 male nonathletes in well-established placebo and CPM paradigms to assess whether endurance athletes have a better endogenous pain-inhibition system than nonathletes. As expected, we find a significantly greater CPM effect in athletes than in nonathletes. In contrast, we could only find a significant placebo effect in nonathletes. Explorative analyses reveal negative associations between the placebo effect and heart rate variability as well as between the placebo effect and interoceptive awareness. Together, the results demonstrate a dissociation of endogenous pain inhibition of CPM and placebo effect between endurance athletes and nonathletes. This suggests that both effects are based, at least in part, on different biological mechanisms.",0
"The present study was designed to examine the effects of training in positive interpretations in clinically anxious children. A total of 87 children between 7 and 12 years of age were randomly assigned to either a positive cognitive bias modification training for interpretation (CMB-I) or a neutral training. Training included 15 sessions in a two-week period. Children with an interpretation bias prior to training in the positive training group showed a significant reduction in interpretation bias on the social threat scenarios after training, but not children in the neutral training group. No effects on interpretation biases were found for the general threat scenarios or the non-threat scenarios. Furthermore, children in the positive training did not self-report lower anxiety than children in the neutral training group. However, mothers and fathers reported a significant reduction in social anxiety in their children after positive training, but not after neutral training. This study demonstrated that clinically anxious children with a prior interpretation bias can be trained away from negative social interpretation biases and there is some evidence that this corresponds to reductions in social anxiety. This study also highlights the importance of using specific training stimuli.",0
"BACKGROUND: The Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP), initially developed as an outpatient treatment for chronic depression (CD), has been adapted as a multidisciplinary 12-week inpatient program for CD. METHODS: Seventy inpatients with CD and treatment resistance were included in a noncontrolled trial. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale served as the primary outcome measure. Prospective naturalistic follow-up assessments were conducted 6 and 12 months after discharge. RESULTS: Dropout rate was 7.1%; 90.4% perceived the program as helpful. Pre-post comparisons yielded strong effect sizes; 75.7% of the intention-to-treat sample responded, and 40.0% remitted. Nonremission was associated with experiencing temporary deterioration of symptoms during treatment. After 6 months 75.0% and after 12 months 48.0% of patients sustained response. CONCLUSIONS: The CBASP program appears as a feasible acute treatment for treatment-resistant CD inpatients with promising outcome. However, the continuation of treatment after discharge should be optimized especially for patients with subjective deterioration during treatment.",1
"Racism and intergroup discrimination are pervasive problems in human societies. Whereas several studies have shown that children show bias in the context of many kinds of groups, much less is known about how and when general psychological tendencies and contextual factors contribute to the manifestation of intergroup bias across development, and whether individual differences play a role. In the present study, we pursue these questions by investigating and comparing the developmental trajectories of intergroup bias in 5- to 10-year-old (mostly) White children (n = 100). We assessed children's liking and preferences towards 4 racial groups (White, East Asian, Black, and Middle Eastern) and towards 2 gender groups (male and female) in a within-subject design. We found that the young children in our sample showed a significant racial and gender ingroup bias, speaking to an early and strong manifestation of intergroup bias on the basic ingroup-outgroup distinction. This bias decreased with age. At the same time, we found considerable differences between the different types of outgroups from early on. Furthermore, there were remarkable differences between the developmental trajectories of gender and racial intergroup bias, highlighting the role of both social and contextual influences. Finally, our results did not reveal consistent evidence for the influence of individual differences on children's intergroup bias.",0
"Adults of three age groups (18-27, 39-45, and 59-66 years) performed an auditory duration discrimination task with short (200 ms) or long (400 ms) sinusoidal tones. Performance was highly accurate and reaction times were on the same level in all groups, indicating no differences in auditory duration processing. Task irrelevant rare changes of the frequency of the stimuli were introduced to check whether the subjects, firstly, were distracted by changes in the environment while focusing on the task relevant information (indicated by prolonged responses), and, secondly, could re-focus on the relevant task after distraction. The results show that a distraction effect is present in all groups. Importantly, the 59-66 years group showed a behavioral distraction effect nearly twice as high as the other groups. The event-related brain potentials (ERPs) show mismatch negativity (MMN), P3a, and reorienting negativity (RON) elicited by deviants which are present in all groups. Aging effects on these ERP components were observable in all three components but a revealed a weak significant effect for the MMN only. Taken together, the behavioral and ERP results suggest that the function of balancing the processing of task irrelevant changes in the stimulation while focusing on task relevant information is effective during adulthood until the 7th decade of life.",1
"Models of social anxiety disorder (SAD) stress the relevance of physiological arousal. So far, limited research has been conducted in children with SAD in experimental stress designs. Thus, examining autonomic arousal, children with and without SAD completed a standardized social stressor (Trier Social Stress Test for Children-C; TSST-C). Pre-existing differences to healthy controls (HC) were expected to decrease after receiving cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Children with SAD (n = 64) and HC children (n = 55) completed a TSST-C. Children with SAD participated in a second TSST-C after either cognitive-behavioral treatment or a waitlist-control period (WLC). As expected, children with SAD showed blunted heart rate reactivity compared to HC children. Further, children with SAD had elevated levels of tonic sympathetic arousal as indexed by skin conductance level compared to HC. Children with SAD showed lower parasympathetic arousal during the baseline compared to HC. Children receiving treatment did not differ from children in the WLC condition in a repeated social stress test. Psychophysiological differences between children with SAD and HC children could be confirmed as indicated by previous research. The lack of physiological effects of the intervention as an experimental manipulation might be related to slower changes in physiology compared to e.g. cognition.",0
"Arousal and the way it is coped with are relevant to the emergence of psychotic symptoms. Heart rate variability (HRV) stems from autonomic responses to environmental demands such as stress and is an index of physiological arousal, adaptability, and homeostatic reflexes forming autonomic balance. A randomized-controlled between-subjects trial that compared HRV-biofeedback (BF) to an active relaxation and to a waiting control condition was conducted in a sample with attenuated subclinical psychotic symptoms (N = 84). A 20-min intervention was preceded and followed by repeated assessments of stress responses. Change scores of the post-stress periods were analyzed using ANOVAs for HRV, subjective stress, perceived control, and state paranoia. As expected, BF participants showed greater improvements in perceived control than waiting controls (p = 0.006). However, no group differences occurred in HRV, paranoid symptoms or subjective stress. In exploratory analyses in a subset of participants who were breathing per protocol, the expected effects were found for total HRV and state paranoia. Thus, this trial of HRV-BF for people with attenuated psychotic symptoms indicates that the intervention may hold potential if conducted per protocol. To reach this, longer training might be inevitable. Future studies are needed to further elucidate efficacy and applicability of HRV-BF in clinical samples.",0
"OBJECTIVE: The authors examined whether D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, augments and accelerates a full course of comprehensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in adults with generalized social anxiety disorder. METHOD: This was a multisite randomized placebo-controlled efficacy study with 169 medication-free adults with generalized social anxiety disorder, of whom 144 completed the 12-week treatment and 131 completed the three follow-up assessments. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg of D-cycloserine or placebo 1 hour before each of five exposure sessions that were part of a 12-session cognitive-behavioral group treatment. Response and remission status was determined at baseline, throughout treatment, at end of treatment, and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments by assessors who were blind to treatment condition. RESULTS: D-Cycloserine-augmented and placebo-augmented CBT were associated with similar completion rates (87% and 82%), response rates (79.3% and 73.3%), and remission rates (34.5% and 24.4%) at the posttreatment assessment; response and remission rates were largely maintained at the follow-up assessments. Although D-cycloserine was associated with a 24%-33% faster rate of improvement in symptom severity and remission rates relative to placebo during the treatment phase, the groups did not differ in response and remission rates. CONCLUSIONS: D-Cycloserine did not augment a full course of comprehensive CBT for social anxiety disorder.",0
"BACKGROUND: A positive predictive genetic test for Huntington's disease (HD) can be a life-changing event for both carriers and their partners, leading to lower wellbeing and increasing the risk for separation and divorce. The 'Hold me Tight' program (HmT), based on emotionally focused couples' therapy, aims at strengthening the couple bond by targeting attachment needs. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether the HmT program helps couples strengthen their relationship, as an investment in a future where the disease will affect life in many ways. METHODS: In a multiple baseline design using three baselines of varying length, 15 couples of presymptomatic HD-carriers and their partners were included. In three consecutive groups, couples underwent the intervention (an adapted version of the 8-session HmT program) in four weekly sessions and completed self-report questionnaires throughout the study period of 19 weeks (17 measurements). Attachment style was assessed at baseline, resilience at baseline and at the end of the follow-up, while relationship satisfaction and wellbeing were measured weekly. A multi-level model was applied to the data. RESULTS: Over the course of the study, wellbeing and relationship satisfaction significantly improved; resilience, however, did not. Furthermore, all three outcome measures were moderated by attachment style, with more securely attached individuals showing better outcomes. CONCLUSION: HmT improved wellbeing and relationship satisfaction of couples facing HD. Due to these improvements and high patient acceptability rates, this program could become a standardized procedure in HD care. The program could be adapted for other populations, e.g., couples facing other genetic neurological disorders.",0
"Diagnosing autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a complicated, time-consuming process which is particularly challenging in older individuals. One of the most widely used behavioral diagnostic tools is the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Previous work using machine learning techniques suggested that ASD detection in children can be achieved with substantially fewer items than the original ADOS. Here, we expand on this work with a specific focus on adolescents and adults as assessed with the ADOS Module 4. We used a machine learning algorithm (support vector machine) to examine whether ASD detection can be improved by identifying a subset of behavioral features from the ADOS Module 4 in a routine clinical sample of N = 673 high-functioning adolescents and adults with ASD (n = 385) and individuals with suspected ASD but other best-estimate or no psychiatric diagnoses (n = 288). We identified reduced subsets of 5 behavioral features for the whole sample as well as age subgroups (adolescents vs. adults) that showed good specificity and sensitivity and reached performance close to that of the existing ADOS algorithm and the full ADOS, with no significant differences in overall performance. These results may help to improve the complicated diagnostic process of ASD by encouraging future efforts to develop novel diagnostic instruments for ASD detection based on the identified constructs as well as aiding clinicians in the difficult question of differential diagnosis.",1
"PURPOSE: Subjective social status (SSS) reflects individuals' perceived position in a social hierarchy. Low SSS is associated with several mental health impairments. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine if unemployed individuals report lower SSS in Germany (national SSS) and lower SSS in their social community (local SSS) than employed individuals. Moreover, the relationship between unemployment, SSS, and mental health was examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 113 unemployed and 1117 employed individuals from a representative German panel provided information on their national and local SSS, their monthly income and their mental health. SSS was assessed with the German version of the MacArthur Scales. Mental health was measured using the mental component scale (MCS) of the SF-12. RESULTS: Unemployed individuals reported significantly lower national SSS, local SSS and mental health compared to employed participants. Mediational analyses suggest that the negative effect of employment status on mental health was explained via a reduction of national SSS. Local SSS did not mediate the association of employment status and mental health. CONCLUSION: Unemployment is associated with lower SSS and reduced mental health. The perceived position relative to others in the country (ie, national SSS) mediates the association between employment status and mental health.",0
"Abstract The Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) is commonly used to measure people’s general tendency to ruminate. In this study, we explored whether only few items from the RRS can be used to capture within-person variation in rumination in intensive longitudinal studies. Such a short RRS version would allow, for example, monitoring the development of rumination during clinical interventions. We measured rumination on five occasions, with at least one week in between. We used multilevel analyses to analyze the data at the within- and between-person level. Using only eight RRS items, we successfully modeled a reflective self-regulation and depressive brooding factor, similar to the two subfacets of rumination as distinguished by Treynor et al. (2003). We also established convergent validity of depressive brooding at the within- and between-person level of analysis and convergent validity of reflection at the between-person level. We thus introduced a short form of the RRS that captures within-person variation in depressive brooding and reflection well. The short RRS is readily applicable in studies on within-person variation or change in rumination.",1
"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is an impairing condition characterized by excessive appearance concerns that frequently begin in adolescence, thus making this phase an eminent target for prevention and early intervention. We developed a cognitive-behavioral app-based program (AINA) intended for prevention and early intervention of BDD. As part of the iterative development process, perceptions of usability, aesthetics, and content were investigated. A sample of 38 adolescents and young adults aged between 14 and 21 years tested the app in a laboratory setting and completed a survey of diagnostic and user experience questionnaires. Overall, usability, aesthetics, and content of the app received positive evaluations. Regression analyses did not point to any large effects of age, gender, years of education, self-esteem, or BDD symptom severity on user evaluations. On average, participants had no concerns about privacy or data security of the app, indicating that these aspects will presumably not act as barriers to usage. Altogether, the present results are encouraging. Future research needs to examine whether AINA is an efficacious measure for prevention and early intervention of BDD.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cognitive models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) highlight the role of cognitive biases for the development of the disorder. One of these biases, an inflated sense of responsibility has been associated with higher anger scores and latent aggression on self-report scales, especially in patients with compulsive checking. Validity of self-report assessment is, however, compromised by inaccuracy, social desirability, and low metacognitive awareness of traits and behaviors in patients. The aim of the present study was to extend the research on latent aggression in individuals with OCD by using an indirect, implicit measure of aggression. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with OCD and 25 healthy controls were assessed with an Aggressiveness-Implicit Association Test (IAT), which is a reaction time task that assesses the strength of associations between the concept of ""aggressiveness"" and ""me"" compared to others. RESULTS: Contrary to our expectation, OCD patients with checking symptoms showed a more peaceful implicit self-concept than healthy controls. This result was corroborated by negative correlations between checking symptoms and implicit aggressiveness in the OCD sample. LIMITATIONS: No self-report measures on aggression or anger were included in the study. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to previous research using self-report measures, our study indicates that implicit aspects of aggression do indeed differ from controlled aspects in patients with checking compulsions. Future research is necessary to better understand the role of aggressiveness in OCD and to derive implications for therapy.",0
"Venepuncture procedures are frequently employed to continuously monitor humoral stress markers. As such procedures are conceived as ""potent psychological and physiological stressors"", there is a need to determine whether venepuncture procedures themselves elicit cortisol responses and if so, how to deal with them appropriately. In order to assess the rate of cortisol responses to venepuncture, we conducted a literature review, which suggested that venepuncture procedures induce cortisol responses with a probability of approximately 30%. By utilizing Bayesian analysis, this result was integrated with the cortisol data of 18 healthy men who were exposed to a venepuncture procedure twice (time lag: 1 week). The currently observed response rate of 47% differed substantially from the earlier findings, which we attribute to a self-selective sampling of participants. In addition, participants showing a response to the first venepuncture were highly likely to also show a response to the second one. In this regard, we discuss the presumed conditioning of cortisol responses to venepuncture procedures. To prevent the superposition of venepuncture-induced cortisol responses and responses induced by target stressors, we propose a time- and selection-based strategy: cortisol samples taken about 110min after venepuncture should be virtually adjusted for its superimposing effects. Furthermore, previous experiences of venepuncture were highly predictive for cortisol responsiveness. This association could be utilized in further studies to identify participants who will probably show a cortisol response to venepuncture.",1
"OBJECTIVE: Problem-drinking among university students is common and poses serious health-related risks. Therefore, identifying and addressing associated factors is important. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A large cross-sectional online-survey with 12,914 university students from Berlin was conducted from November 2016 to August 2017. Relative-risk- and correlation-analysis was used to identify factors associated with problem-drinking and regular heavy-drinking. Independent t-tests compared impulsivity and personality traits, chi-square-tests compared drinking motives between risk- and non-risk-drinkers. RESULTS: Male gender, tobacco-smoking, illegal substance use, impulsivity and various sociodemographic and psychosocial variables were significantly related to problem/heavy-drinking. Extraversion was a risk, conscientiousness and agreeableness were protective factors. Drinking-motives did not differ significantly between risk- and non-risk-drinkers. Generally, the main drinking-motives were to feel elated, relax and social purposes. CONCLUSION: The identified markers and related problem behaviors may serve as a tool to enhance the identification of student subgroups at risk for problem/heavy-drinking, and hence improve targeted health-intervention-programs.",0
"Sexual difficulties are common among women and men and are associated with various mental and physical health problems. Although psychological traits are known to impact sexual attitudes and behavior, sexuality- and personality-related traits have not been jointly investigated to assess their relevance for sexual functioning in couples. The aim of this study was to investigate how psychological traits of two partners influence women's and men's sexual function. Data from 964 couples, representative of the adult population in Germany, were analyzed. Sexual function was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Sexuality-related traits were measured with the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women and Men (SESII-W/M). Personality was measured with self-report and partner-rating versions of the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Sexual excitation was a positive and sexual inhibition was a negative predictor of sexual function in both genders. Women whose partners were sexually inhibited reported lower sexual function. Conscientious individuals reported better sexual function. Women whose partners were more conscientious also had better sexual function. Assessing partner-related factors may be helpful to identify predisposing and maintaining factors of sexual dysfunctions, especially in women.",1
"Background: Relationship quality and sleep quality influenced physiological and psychological health. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine a possible connection between relationship satisfaction and sleep quality and to test a theoretical model of sleep quality as related to relationship and psychological well-being. Methods: Fifty-one heterosexual, cohabitating couples between 24 and 70 years old participated. The relationship quality was measured by the German short version of relationship questionnaire. To determine the sleep quality, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and a two-week sleep diary were implemented. To gather information about psychological well-being, especially depression and anxiety, the German Symptom Checklist was used. Results: Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and relationship quality correlated significantly negative. In addition, the study found a positive correlation between sleep duration and relationship quality. In a multiple regression model, fighting and mental strain explained 38% of variance of sleep quality. Depression, anxiety and relationship quality showed no further improvement of the model. These findings suggested that relationship quality, constructive partnership behavior and mental strain played an essential role in sleep quality.",0
"The study explored whether target detection in a five-character string depends on whether a letter or a non-letter was presented, as a predesignated target. Skilled readers had to identify a single letter or non-letter in a five-character string, randomly composed of letters and non-letters. It was found that an analytic processing strategy is automatically elicited if participants were instructed to detect a letter target. In this instance, a linear model best explained the RT variance for letters: with increasing RTs from left to right, suggesting a serial item-by-item reading-specific strategy comparable to alphabetic reading. For non-letters, in contrast, a symmetrical U-shaped function best explained the RT variance, suggesting a symmetrical scanning-out from the central to the terminal positions of the string. Since the design precludes orthographic and semantic influences, it can be concluded that a reading-specific strategy for alphabetic processing is automatically activated if the string is scanned for a letter-target. Thus, the pre-designated target triggers the strategy for processing the string and determines related position effects. The results suggest that effects from earlier studies, which showed an analytic processing preference for isolated letters (APPLE) in recognition tasks, as a consequence of literacy acquisition, generalize to the processing of letters in strings.",1
"AIM: To appraise the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ)'s measurement of diabetes self-management as a statistical predictor of glycaemic control relative to the widely used SDSCA. METHODS: 248 patients with type 1 diabetes and 182 patients with type 2 diabetes were cross-sectionally assessed using the two self-report measures of diabetes self-management DSMQ and SDSCA; the scales were used as competing predictors of HbA1c. We developed a structural equation model of self-management as measured by the DSMQ and analysed the amount of variation explained in HbA1c; an analogue model was developed for the SDSCA. RESULTS: The structural equation models of self-management and glycaemic control showed very good fit to the data. The DSMQ's measurement of self-management showed associations with HbA1c of -0.53 for type 1 and -0.46 for type 2 diabetes (both P < 0.001), explaining 21% and 28% of variation in glycaemic control, respectively. The SDSCA's measurement showed associations with HbA1c of -0.14 (P = 0.030) for type 1 and -0.31 (P = 0.003) for type 2 diabetes, explaining 2% and 10% of glycaemic variation. Predictive power for glycaemic control was significantly higher for the DSMQ (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the DSMQ as the preferred tool when analysing self-reported behavioural problems related to reduced glycaemic control. The scale may be useful for clinical assessments of patients with suboptimal diabetes outcomes or research on factors affecting associations between self-management behaviours and glycaemic control.",1
"OBJECTIVE: Peer victimization (e.g. social exclusion) has been shown to be associated with physical health problems such as functional somatic complaints and especially symptoms of pain. To date, no study has investigated the mechanisms underlying this association in clinical pediatric samples. The aim of this study was to evaluate the parasympathetic activity during a social exclusion experience in adolescents with functional abdominal pain (FAP). METHODS: Twenty adolecents with FAP and 21 matched healthy participants were compared regarding parameters of parasympathetic activation before, during, and after participating in the Cyberball-game, a well-established paradigm to induce social exclusion. RESULTS: Adolescents with FAP showed an increase in parasympathetic activation during both consecutive phases of the Cyberball game (inclusion as well as exclusion condition) whereas the healthy control group remained stable. There were no differences in subjective experience of in- and exclusion between the groups. CONCLUSION: The parasympathetic activation pattern may indicate altered processing of social stimuli in adolescents with FAP.",0
"BACKGROUND: The association between children's exposure to family violence and poor academic outcomes is well-established. Less is known about how exposure to violence in the school context, i.e., by teachers and by peers, affects academic functioning. Moreover, the role of children's mental health problems in this link has hardly been examined. OBJECTIVES: We examined direct and indirect associations between children's experiences of violence by teachers and peers and children's mental health and school functioning while controlling for children's experiences of parental violence. PARTICIPANTS: Using a multistage random sampling approach, we obtained a representative sample of 914 students (50.5 % girls, M(age) = 12.58 years) from 12 primary schools in Tanzania. METHODS: In structured interviews, students' experiences of violence and mental health problems were assessed. Students' academic performance and absenteeism were documented using school records. Associations were examined using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: Experiences of more teacher and peer violence were each significantly associated with higher externalizing problems (teachers: beta = 0.27 [95 %-CI: 0.12, 0.47]; peers: beta = 0.17, [95 %-CI: 0.07, 0.32]). Higher externalizing problems were significantly associated with poorer academic performance (beta = -0.13, [95 %-CI: -0.23, -0.02]), implying significant indirect associations between students' experiences of teacher violence (beta = -0.04, [95 %-CI: -0.08, -0.01]) and peer violence (beta = -0.02, [95 %-CI: -0.05, -0.01]) and their academic performance via externalizing problems. CONCLUSION: Exposure to violence at school may impair children's academic performance indirectly by increasing attention and behaviour problems. Further investigations in longitudinal studies and implementation of interventions to reduce violence in schools are indicated.",1
"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether symptoms of depression or anxiety predict glycaemia and incident diabetes complications four years later, and whether diabetes self-care behaviours mediate these associations, in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). METHODS: Data of 205 adults with T1DM from the 2011 and 2015 Diabetes MILES-Australia surveys were analysed. Variables of interest were: baseline depression and anxiety (PHQ-8 and GAD-7, respectively) symptoms; HbA(1c) and incident complications at four-year follow-up; and self-care behaviours at both time points. Longitudinal associations were analysed using structural equation modelling. RESULTS: Forty-two participants (20.6%) reported incident complications. Baseline depressive symptoms predicted higher HbA(1c) at follow-up indirectly via less optimal self-care at follow-up (beta = 0.19, P = 0.011). Baseline anxiety was not independently associated with HbA(1c) or self-care at follow-up (P >/= 0.64). Neither depressive nor anxiety symptoms predicted incident complications, although depressive symptoms were associated with less optimal self-care at baseline (beta = -0.67, P < 0.001), and this predicted microvascular complications (beta = -0.38, P = 0.044); however, the indirect association via self-care was not significant (beta = 0.25, P = 0.067). LIMITATIONS: Participants were self-selected; all study variables were assessed using self-report measures; and adjusting for baseline HbA(1c) was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms predicted suboptimal self-care behaviour and glycaemic outcome four years later, while anxiety symptoms did not. The findings suggest that tailored diabetes care should take the potential impact of comorbid depression into consideration to help people improve their diabetes self-care and achieve best possible health outcomes.",0
"BACKGROUND: Patients with psychotic disorders report to apply more maladaptive and less adaptive emotion-regulation (ER) strategies compared to healthy controls. However, few studies have used experimental designs to investigate the success in ER and the results of those at hand are equivocal. AIM: This study investigated whether patients with delusions show problems in downregulating negative affect via cognitive ER-strategies. METHOD: Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and acute delusions (n = 78) and healthy controls (n = 41) took part in an ER-experiment, in which they were instructed to downregulate anxiety and sadness via three ER-strategies (reappraisal, distraction, acceptance) or not to regulate their emotions (control-condition). ER-success was measured as the change in subjective emotion-intensity and physiological indicators (skin conductance and heart rate) from before to after regulation and was analyzed with mixed-repeated-measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: We found a significant effect of the ER-strategy in the sense that the subjective emotion-intensity was significantly lower after applying the reappraisal- and distraction-strategies than after the just view-condition (p's < .001). This effect was not found for the acceptance strategy (p = .060). There was no ER-strategy * time * group interaction-effect F(4.918, 575.416) = 0.778, p = .564, n(2)(partial) = 0.007. In all conditions, skin conductance decreased from pre- to post regulation (p < .001). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that patients with acute delusions can successfully apply cognitive ER-strategies. Before pursuing the relevant clinical implications of this finding, further research is needed to explore the role that the type of instruction has on ER-success and the extent to which the findings can be generalized to real life settings.",0
"BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and may afford stable long-term improvements. It is not clear, however, how stability or symptom recurrence can be predicted at the time of termination of CBT. METHOD: In a 1-year follow-up intention-to-treat study with 120 OCD patients receiving individual CBT at a university outpatient unit, we investigated the predictive value of international consensus criteria for response only (Y-BOCS score reduction by at least 35%) and remission status (Y-BOCS score </= 12). Secondly, we applied receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves in order to find an optimal cut-off score to classify for deterioration and for sustained gains. RESULTS: Response only at post-treatment increased the likelihood of deterioration at follow-up compared to remission at an odds ratio of 8.8. Moreover, ROC curves indicated that a post-treatment score of >/= 13 differentiated optimally between patients with and without symptom deterioration at follow-up assessment. The optimal cut-off score to classify for any sustained gains (response, remission, or both) at follow-up relative to baseline was 12. Importantly, previous findings of generally high long-term symptom stability after treatment in OCD could be replicated. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the clinical importance of reaching remission during CBT, and suggest that a recently published expert consensus for defining remission has high utility.",1
"The aim of this study was to investigate not only preoperative expectations (as shown previously), but also postoperative expectations of patients predict clinical outcomes six months after cardiac surgery. Furthermore, the study sought to examine illness behavior as a possible pathway through which expectations may affect postoperative well-being. Seventy patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were examined one day before surgery, ~7-10 days after surgery, and six months after surgery. Regression analyses indicated that disability at follow-up (primary outcome) was significantly predicted by postoperative (beta = -.342, p = .008), but not by preoperative expectations (beta = -.213, p = .069). Similar results were found for the secondary outcomes, i.e. quality of life and depressive symptoms. A bootstrapped mediation analysis showed that although both postoperative expectations and illness behavior had significant unique effects on disability, there was no significant mediation effect. While previous studies have mainly focused on patients' preoperative expectations, the present is the first to emphasize the predictive value of patients' expectations a few days after surgery, pointing to the potential of interventions targeting postoperative expectations. However, given the non-significant results of the mediation analysis, it remains unclear how exactly patients' expectations affect clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery.",0
"Obesity is one of the greatest public health challenges in the world with childhood prevalence rates between 20-26% and numerous associated health risks. The aim of the current study was to analyze the 11-year follow-up data of the Ulm Birth Cohort Study (UBCS), to identify whether abnormal eating behavior patterns, especially restrained eating, predict body mass index (BMI) at 11 years of age and to explore other factors known to be longitudinally associated with it. Of the original UBCS, n = 422 children (~ 40% of the original sample) and their parents participated in the 11-year follow-up. BMI at age 8 and 11 as well as information on restrained eating, psychological problems, depressive symptoms, lifestyle, and IQ at age 8 were assessed. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to predict children's BMI scores at age 11. PLS-SEM explained 68% of the variance of BMI at age 11, with BMI at age 8 being the most important predictor. Restrained eating, via BMI at age 8 as well as parental BMI, had further weak associations with BMI at age 11; no other predictor was statistically significant. Since established overweight at age 8 already predicts BMI scores at age 11 longitudinally, obesity interventions should be implemented in early childhood.",0
"BACKGROUND: Compulsive buying-shopping disorder (CBSD) is associated with high materialistic values endorsement and excessive purchasing of consumer goods. A subgroup of individuals with CBSD engage in socially unacceptable behaviors to continue shopping despite negative consequences. This investigation aimed at exploring possible links between ego-oriented shopping-related decisions, materialism, symptoms of CBSD and close-to-everyday moral decision making. METHODS: In study 1, patients with CBSD were interviewed to develop a list of conflict situations, capturing typical shopping-related dilemmas. In study 2, the shopping-related dilemmas from study 1, standardized close-to-everyday moral dilemmas, the Material Values Scale and Pathological Buying Screener were administered to a web-based convenience sample (n = 274). RESULTS: The main effects of a moderated hierarchical regression analysis revealed an association of more ego-oriented shopping-related decisions with both higher materialistic values endorsement and more CBSD symptoms, but not with everyday moral decision-making. However, a more egoistic everyday moral decision making style moderated the effect of CBSD symptoms on ego-oriented shopping related decisions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that a more egoistic everyday moral decision making style is not directly linked to domain-specific shopping-related decision making but strengthens the link between symptoms of CBSD and ego-oriented shopping-related decisions.",0
"Identifying distinct neural networks underlying social affect (empathy, compassion) and social cognition (Theory of Mind) has advanced our understanding of social interactions. However, little is known about the relation of activation in these networks to psychological experience in daily life. This study (N = 122) examined the ecological validity of neural activation patterns induced by a laboratory paradigm of social affect and cognition with respect to social interactions in everyday life. We used the EmpaToM task, a naturalistic video-based paradigm for the assessment of empathy, compassion, and Theory of Mind, and combined it with a subsequent 14-day ecological momentary assessment protocol on social interactions. Everyday social affect was predicted by social affect experienced during the EmpaToM task, but not by related neural activation in regions of interest from the social affect network. In contrast, everyday social cognition was predicted by neural activation differences in the medial prefrontal cortex - a region of interest from the social cognition network - but not by social cognition performance in the EmpaToM task. The relationship between medial prefrontal cortex activation and everyday social cognition was stronger for spontaneous rather than deliberate perspective taking during the EmpaToM task, pointing to a distinction between propensity and capacity in social cognition. Finally, this neural indicator of Theory of Mind explained variance in everyday social cognition to a similar extent as an established self-report scale. Taken together, this study provides evidence for the ecological validity of lab-based social affect and cognition paradigms when considering relevant moderating factors.",0
"OBJECTIVES: Major depressive disorder (MDD) involves peripheral low-grade pro-inflammatory activity. This multi-biomarker case-control study characterises the proinflammatory status in MDD beyond C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin (IL)-6 levels through investigating concomitant alterations of immunoregulatory biomolecules. METHODS: In 20 female MDD patients and 24 non-depressed women, circulating levels of CRP, IL-6, cortisol, selected endocannabinoids (ECs; anandamide [AEA], 2-arachidonylglycerol [2-AG]), and N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), as well as circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) were measured. RESULTS: We found higher serum CRP and plasma AEA levels in MDD and a positive association of CRP and AEA levels with current depressive symptoms. Blood levels of cortisol, ccf-mtDNA, 2-AG, and NAEs did depend on MDD diagnosis nor correlated with the severity of current depressive symptoms. CRP correlated positively with AEA, and AEA showed positive associations with 2-AG and NAE levels. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, female MDD outpatients with mild to moderate disorder severity did not substantially differ from non-depressed controls in the resting levels of multiple immunoregulatory markers in peripheral blood. Instead of investigating resting levels, future research on the role of inflammatory activity in MDD should focus on investigating the reactivity of pathways modulating the immune system upon exposure to physical and psychosocial stressors.",0
"Prevalence rates for mental health problems are higher when an individual's socioeconomic status (SES) is low, but the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. We investigated associations between education as indicator for SES and depressive symptoms as well as positive mental health (PMH). Moreover, we hypothesized that low education is associated with a lack of psychosocial resources and more daily hassles, which in turn mediate the relationships between education and mental health. In a German representative sample (N = 7937), we cross-sectionally first examined whether a person's educational level was associated with depressive symptoms and PMH. Educational level was defined as the highest academic qualification achieved. Second, we investigated whether also sense of control, resilience, delay of gratification, cultural activity and daily hassles followed gradients along the educational level. Third, we investigated whether they mediated the relationship between education and mental health. Results showed that depressive symptoms measured by items from the DASS-42 depression subscale were more prevalent for persons with a low educational level, PMH operationalized by the Positive Mental Health Scale was equally distributed, and all psychosocial characteristics followed the gradient of educational level. In addition, the group with a high school diploma was particularly burdened. Structural equation modeling indicated that the associations between education and mental health were mediated by all psychosocial characteristics and daily hassles, apart from the delay of gratification. In the group with the lowest educational level the model fit indices for depressive symptoms and PMH were acceptable (chi2 = 10007.243 (627), CFI = 0.869, RMSEA = 0.04 (90% CI [0.04, 0.04], SRMR = 0.05; and chi2 = 12779.968 (741), CFI = 0.86, RMSEA = 0.05 (90% CI [0.05, 0.05], SRMR = 0.05), respectively). The effect size P(m) refers to the proportion of the total effect that is mediated by one or more variables (""M""), and the effect size of all indirect effects in the model for depressive symptoms was P(m) = .80 and for PMH it was P(m) = .68. The results support our hypotheses that low education is associated with less psychosocial resources, which in turn serve together with daily hassles as pathways between education and depressive symptoms as well as PMH. Building on these findings, longitudinal studies are necessary to investigate causality.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous studies using modified versions of the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Payne, Cheng, Govorun, & Stewart, 2005) have revealed that there is an implicit negative evaluation bias of illness-related information in patients with hypochondriasis (HYP), which might be a maintaining feature of HYP. However, there is no evidence on whether this bias might be targeted successfully by effective treatments, such as exposure therapy (ET) or cognitive therapy (CT). This is the first study to examine the change in negative implicit evaluations in a randomized controlled trial, including individual CT and ET, compared to a wait-list control group for HYP. METHODS: An AMP with illness, symptom and neutral primes was used in 70 patients with HYP before and after treatment (wait-list respectively). RESULTS: There was no significant change in negative implicit affective evaluations in both CT and ET, compared to wait-list. However, comparisons between the two active treatments revealed an interaction effect, that only for CT were the affective reactions on illness-as well as symptom-related prime trials (but not neutral primes) significantly more positive at post-compared to pre-treatment. In CT but not in ET, the reduction of implicit negative evaluation bias regarding symptom-related primes was significantly related to the reduction of self-reported health anxiety. LIMITATIONS: The small subsample sizes for CT and ET, in comparison to wait-list, prohibit the detection of smaller effects. CONCLUSIONS: Formal cognitive restructuring is necessary for reducing implicit negative evaluation bias in HYP, but the latter is not a prerequisite for reducing health anxiety. Thus, the importance of the negative implicit evaluation bias for the maintenance of HYP remains questionable.",0
"In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, media reports have caused anxiety and distress in many. In some individuals, feeling distressed by information may lead to avoidance of information, which has been shown to undermine compliance with preventive health behaviors in many health domains (e.g., cancer screenings). We set out to examine whether feeling distressed by information predicts higher avoidance of information about COVID-19 (avoidance hypothesis), and whether this, in turn, predicts worse compliance with measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (compliance hypothesis). Thus, we conducted an online survey with a convenience sample (N = 1,059, 79.4% female) and assessed distress by information, information avoidance, and compliance with preventive measures. Furthermore, we inquired about participants' information seeking behavior and media usage, their trust in information sources, and level of eHealth literacy, as well as generalized anxiety. We conducted multiple linear regression analyses to predict distress by information, information avoidance, and compliance with preventive measures. Overall, distress by information was associated with better compliance. However, distress was also linked with an increased tendency to avoid information (avoidance hypothesis), and this reduced compliance with preventive measures (compliance hypothesis). Thus, distress may generally induce adaptive behavior in support of crisis management, unless individuals respond to it by avoiding information. These findings provide insights into the consequences of distress by information and avoidance of information during a global health crisis. These results underscore that avoiding information is a maladaptive response to distress by information, which may ultimately interfere with effective crisis management. Consequently, we emphasize the need to develop measures to counteract information avoidance.",1
"Unconscious stimuli can influence participants' motor behavior as well as more complex mental processes. Previous cue-priming experiments demonstrated that masked cues can modulate endogenous shifts of spatial attention as measured by choice reaction time tasks. Here, we applied a signal detection task with masked luminance targets to determine the source and the scope of effects of masked stimuli. Target-detection performance was modulated by prime-cue congruency, indicating that prime-cue congruency modulates signal enhancement at early levels of target processing. These effects, however, were only found when the prime was perceptually similar to the cue indicting that primes influence early target processing in an indirect way by facilitating cue processing. Together with previous research we conclude that masked stimuli can modulate perceptual and post-central levels of processing. Findings mark a new limit of the effects of unconscious stimuli which seem to have a smaller scope than conscious stimuli.",0
"OBJECTIVE: There is scarce research on the effects of mindfulness in individual therapy. As many practitioners integrate mindfulness exercises into individual therapy, empirical evidence is of high clinical relevance. METHOD: We investigated the effects of a session-introducing intervention with mindfulness elements (SIIME) in a randomized, controlled design. The effects of SIIME on therapeutic alliance and symptomatic outcome were compared with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and treatment-as-usual (TAU) control conditions. The sample comprised 162 patients with anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling revealed a significant symptom reduction and significant increase of alliance over the course of therapy. There were no significant time-condition interactions on outcome and alliance, indicating the comparable efficiency of all three treatment conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We found no advantage of SIIME versus PMR and TAU. Add-on mindfulness might not improve individual therapy related to alliance and outcome.",0
"Perception and evaluation of facial expressions are known to be heavily modulated by emotional features of contextual information. Such contextual effects, however, might also be driven by non-emotional aspects of contextual information, an interaction of emotional and non-emotional factors, and by the observers' inherent traits. Therefore, we sought to assess whether contextual information about self-reference in addition to information about valence influences the evaluation and neural processing of neutral faces. Furthermore, we investigated whether social anxiety moderates these effects. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants viewed neutral facial expressions preceded by a contextual sentence conveying either positive or negative evaluations about the participant or about somebody else. Contextual influences were reflected in rating and fMRI measures, with strong effects of self-reference on brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and right fusiform gyrus. Additionally, social anxiety strongly affected the response to faces conveying negative, self-related evaluations as revealed by the participants' rating patterns and brain activity in cortical midline structures and regions of interest in the left and right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that face perception and processing are highly individual processes influenced by emotional and non-emotional aspects of contextual information and further modulated by individual personality traits.",1
"Our study addressed distinct aspects of social problem solving in 28 hospitalized patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and 28 matched healthy controls. Three scenario-based tests assessed the ability to infer the mental states of story characters in difficult interpersonal situations, the capacity to freely generate good strategies for dealing with such situations and the ability to identify the best solutions among less optimal alternatives. Also, standard tests assessing attention, memory, executive function and trait empathy were administered. Compared to controls, MDD patients showed impaired interpretation of other peoples' sarcastic remarks but not of the mental states underlying other peoples' actions. Furthermore, MDD patients generated fewer strategies that were socially sensitive and practically effective at the same time or at least only socially sensitive. Overall, while the free generation of adequate strategies for difficult social situations was impaired, recognition of optimal solutions among alternatives was spared in MDD patients. Higher generation scores were associated with higher trait empathy and cognitive flexibility scores. We suggest that this specific pattern of impairments ought to be considered in the development of therapies addressing impaired social skills in MDD.",0
"Forced migration is one of the major challenges currently facing the international community. Many refugees have been affected by traumatic experiences at home and during their flight, putting them at a heightened risk of developing trauma-related disorders. The new version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) introduced two sibling disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD). So far, little is known about risk and protective factors in refugees that are specifically associated with the disturbances in self-organization (DSO) characteristic of CPTSD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between PTSD and DSO symptoms and traumatic experiences, postmigration difficulties, and social support in a culturally diverse sample of refugees who resettled in Switzerland. A total of 94 refugees (85.1% male; M age = 31.60 years, SD = 10.14, range: 18-61 years) participated in this study. Trained assessors performed either guided questionnaire assessments or structured interviews. In our advice- and help-seeking sample, 32.9% of individuals suffered from PTSD and 21.3% from CPTSD. After controlling for potential gender differences, we found positive associations between PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure, beta = .22, as well as between DSO symptoms and postmigration living difficulties, beta = .42, and lack of social support, beta = .22. Our findings support the notion that it is highly important to consider differential associations among PTSD and DSO symptoms and risk and protective factors to gain a deeper understanding of the trauma-related problems refugees face.",1
"Abnormalities of the hippocampus are intricately involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Hippocampal volume decrease is present at disease onset and has mainly been observed in the anterior and posterior part of the hippocampus. Nevertheless, an association between regionally specific hippocampal shape deformities putatively affecting a pathophysiologically crucial region, i.e. cornu ammonis field 1 (CA1), and symptomatology as well as required maintenance medication has not been observed. The aim of this study was to characterize the relationship between CA1-specific hippocampal surface deformations and symptom severity. Furthermore, we aimed to explore whether such specific morphological hippocampus abnormalities statistically predict the maintenance dosage of antipsychotic medication. Hippocampal shape and volume were determined by manual segmentation of high resolution, whole brain, three-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Associations between hippocampal volume, specific shape deformities in CA1, and positive and negative symptoms were assessed in 32 patients with schizophrenia and compared with 34 healthy control subjects. In addition to volume reductions of the left hippocampus, patients with schizophrenia displayed specific shape deformities in the left anterior and posterior CA1 subfield. Overall, the severity of positive symptoms was closely associated to these morphological deformities, specifically delusions and hallucinations. In addition, CA1 deformity was linked to the required antipsychotic dosage. Findings were replicated in a second, independent sample. Hippocampal CA1 deformity, possibly reflecting shrinkage, might result from a specific hyperactivity, leading to a circumscribed volume loss. Owing to its physiological function, deficits in CA1 may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of hallucinations and delusions, core symptoms in schizophrenia.",1
"Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) show deficits in reward-guided decision making and learning. The present study examined risk-taking behavior in combination with feedback processing. Eighteen BPD patients and 18 healthy controls performed a probabilistic two-choice gambling task, while an electroencephalogram was recorded. Options differed in risk, but were identical in expected value and outcome probability. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the feedback-related P300 were analyzed. Healthy controls preferred low-risk over high-risk options, whereas BPD patients chose both option with equal probability. FRN amplitudes were reduced in BPD, but effects of feedback valence and risk did not differ between groups. This suggests attenuated outcome processing in the anterior cingulate cortex, but intact reward prediction error signaling. Furthermore, the modulation of the feedback-related P300 with feedback valence and risk was smaller in BPD patients, and decreased P300 amplitudes were associated with increased behavioral risk-taking behavior. These findings could relate to the reduced ability of BPD patients to learn and adequately adjust their behavior based on feedback information, possibly due to reduced significance of negative feedback.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Although the relationship between insecure attachment patterns and eating disorder (ED) psychopathology has repeatedly been demonstrated, the underlying mechanisms of this association are not fully understood. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine personality functioning, defined as an impairment in self and interpersonal functioning, as a mediator between attachment insecurity and ED psychopathology. METHODS: In a representative population-based sample (N = 2508; age range 14-92 years) ED symptomatology, personality functioning, and attachment insecurity (anxiety and avoidance) were assessed. Besides descriptive uni-/bivariate analysis, path analysis was used to test a mediation model while controlling for the effects of age, gender, mental distress, and BMI. RESULTS: ED symptomatology was associated with lower levels of personality functioning (r = 0.22) and higher levels of attachment anxiety (r = 0.14) but did not correlate with attachment avoidance (r = 0.02). Path analysis revealed that personality functioning fully mediated the effect of attachment anxiety on ED symptomatology: The indirect effect via personality functioning (beta = 0.04, p < .001) accounted for 77% of the total effect. Fit indices were excellent. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the main results were mainly applicable to women and the middle age group. CONCLUSION: The present findings contribute to the growing body of research using dimensional conceptualizations of personality functioning, suggesting that it provides an informative, overarching framework for understanding and treating ED psychopathology. Findings indicate that underlying individual differences, e.g., with respect to insecure attachment configurations, have relevant implications for symptom manifestations. Potential clinical implications and avenues for future research are discussed.",0
"In their line of duty, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel are exposed to chronically stressful working conditions and recurrent traumatic events, which increase their risk for detrimental health outcomes. Here, we investigated whether this risk is due to altered regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the endocannabinoid system. Therefore, 1 cm hair strands were collected from a cohort of 72 German EMS personnel in order to measure concentrations of cortisol, endocannabinoids [i.e., anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)], and N-acylethanolamines [i.e., stearoylethanolamide (SEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA)]. Rank correlation analyses were conducted to test associations of cortisol, endocannabinoid, and N-acylethanolamine concentrations with the EMS personnel's workload, lifetime trauma exposure, and mental and physical health problems. We found a negative correlation between cortisol and 2-AG concentrations in hair. Higher hair cortisol was associated with higher workload. Reported traumatic stress during childhood and later in life as well as more severe depressive and physical stress symptoms were associated with elevated 2-AG, SEA, OEA, and PEA concentrations. Future longitudinal research needs to address the prospect of tracing biomolecular markers of glucocorticoid, endocannabinoid, and N-acylethanolamine activity as a predicting value of the long-term course of mental and physical well-being.",1
"This study explores the difference in child emotion regulation (ER) and parenting between a heterogeneous clinical sample (ClinS) and a community sample (ComS). We hypothesized that parents of the ClinS would report more dysfunctional child ER and more dysfunctional parenting regarding the child's negative emotions than parents of the ComS. Further, we aimed to predict child ER by parenting behavior, parents' ER, and mental health. Parents of children and adolescents (aged 6-18 years) seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic were compared to a matched sample of parents in a ComS (n = 57 each group). As predicted, the children in the clinical group were reported to use less reappraisal and more suppression than ComS children. No difference was found in dysfunctional emotion parenting between the groups. Reappraisal in parents and supportive reactions to negative emotions predicted reappraisal in children. No predictor was found for child suppression. Child emotion regulation and parents' psychopathology were not associated. These results could suggest new elements for prevention and intervention programs with parents concerning their own emotion regulation and their reaction to negative emotions in children.",0
"Alexithymia is associated with deficiencies to identify, describe and express emotions, paucity of fantasies and an externally oriented cognitive style. The current studies provide evidence that alexithymia is also related to self-regulation processes and exacerbates effects of ego-depletion, a state where self-regulation resources are reduced due to previous acts of self-regulation. In Study 1, ego-depletion effects of a handgrip task on pain tolerance were increased by alexithymia. In Study 2, an emotion suppression task showed stronger effects of ego-depletion on a Stroop task in participants high rather than low in alexithymia, but only after suppression of emotions induced by negative and not positive pictures. The results imply that alexithymia increases susceptibility to ego-depletion effects, that consumption of self-regulatory resources has stronger consequences for people high in alexithymia and that they should experience special support in ways to replenish self-regulation resources.",0
"Distinct lines of research demonstrated that patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a potential precursor of Alzheimer disease (AD), are particularly impaired in remembering relations between items and that the use of emotional targets can facilitate memory in patients with AD. We link these findings by examining learning through positive and negative feedback in patients with aMCI, and explore its anatomic underpinnings with diffusion tensor imaging and tractography. Compared to healthy controls, patients with single-domain aMCI were impaired in learning from positive feedback, while learning from negative outcomes was preserved. Among pathways within the brain circuit involved in feedback learning, abnormal white matter microstructure was observed in tracts, which connect left-hemispheric amygdala with hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In all participants, reduced white matter integrity in this left fiber tract was specifically associated with learning from positive outcomes. Microstructure of right-hemispheric tracts between amygdala and entorhinal cortex was related to learning from negative feedback, and was not compromised in aMCI patients. Our results provide new insight into how anatomical connections might contribute to impaired and preserved aspects of learning behaviors in the early AD process and indicate potential compensatory mechanisms.",0
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Negative distorted self-images (NSI) allegedly maintain social anxiety in adults suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD). These NSI are activated in feared social situations and are often linked to past socially traumatic events. However, because empirical evidence on the presence and characteristics of such NSI in adolescents suffering from SAD is limited, the aim of the present study is to examine the nature of NSI in adolescent SAD patients. METHODS: Using a semi-structured interview, 31 adolescents with a primary diagnosis of SAD and 31 healthy adolescents (HA) who were matched for age and gender, completed a questionnaire set assessing the characteristics of NSI, social anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Relative to the HA-group, those suffering from SAD reported experiencing NSI significantly more frequently, more vividly, and with greater distress. No significant differences between the groups emerged regarding a link between the NSI and an autobiographical event. However, NSI were reported as more often having an observer-perspective in the SAD as compared to the HA-group. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that certain characteristics of the NSI predict social anxiety beyond the influence of depression in adolescents with SAD. DISCUSSION: NSI seem to be an important feature of adolescent SAD and phenomenological comparable to NSI in adults suffering from SAD. CONCLUSIONS: Specific interventions aiming to correct NSI, which have proven to be highly effective in adults, should be developmentally-adapted and evaluated in future studies.",0
"The COVID-19 pandemic can be characterized as a chronic stressor affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, indexed by glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol). We investigated whether salivary cortisol level is increased during a lockdown and whether a lockdown condition affects the association between loneliness, specific COVID-19 related stressors and salivary cortisol level. We conducted a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study with 280 participants in Germany who experienced at least mild loneliness and distress amid COVID-19 from August 2020 to March 2021. We measured their momentary loneliness and COVID-related stressors including worries, information seeking behaviors and feelings of restriction during ""no-lockdown"" or ""lockdown"" stages amid COVID-19. Their salivary cortisol was measured 4 times on the last day of a 7-day EMA study. We found a significant increase in salivary cortisol levels during lockdown compared to no-lockdown. Lockdown stage was found to moderate the relationship between momentary loneliness and salivary cortisol level, i.e., loneliness was positively related to cortisol level specifically during lockdown. Mechanisms explaining the effect of forced social isolation on the association between loneliness and salivary cortisol need to be investigated in future studies.",1
"Since its original proposal, mirror therapy has been established as a successful neurorehabilitative intervention in several neurological disorders to recover motor function or to relieve pain. Mirror therapy seems to operate by reactivating the contralesional representation of the non-mirrored limb in primary motor- and somatosensory cortex. However, mirror boxes have some limitations which prompted the use of additional mirror visual feedback devices. The present study evaluated the utility of mirror glasses compared to a mirror box. We also tested the hypothesis that increased interhemispheric communication between the motor hand areas is the mechanism by which mirror visual feedback recruits the representation of the non-mirrored limb. Therefore, mirror illusion capacity and brain activations were measured in a within-subject design during both mirror visual feedback conditions in counterbalanced order with 20 healthy subjects inside a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Furthermore, we analyzed task-dependent functional connectivity between motor hand representations using psychophysiological interaction analysis during both mirror tasks. Neither the subjective quality of mirror illusions nor the patterns of functional brain activation differed between the mirror tasks. The sensorimotor representation of the non-mirrored hand was recruited in both mirror tasks. However, a significant increase in interhemispheric connectivity between the hand areas was only observed in the mirror glasses condition, suggesting different mechanisms for the recruitment of the representation of the non-mirrored hand in the two mirror tasks. We conclude that the mirror glasses might be a promising alternative to the mirror box, as they induce similar patterns of brain activation. Moreover, the mirror glasses can be easy applied in therapy and research. We want to emphasize that the neuronal mechanisms for the recruitment of the affected limb representation might differ depending on conceptual differences between MVF devices. However, our findings need to be validated within specific patient groups.",0
"Cognitive behaviour therapy, especially exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the treatment of choice for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, a substantial number of patients refuse this method or fail to benefit enough. Metacognitive therapy (MCT) claims to successfully treat OCD without prolonged exposures. However, only case series and small, mostly uncontrolled trials have been published so far. The efficacy and feasibility of MCT for OCD compared to ERP were investigated in a pilot randomized trial. Thirty-seven outpatients with OCD according to DSM-IV criteria were randomly allocated to individual, weekly 14-sessions of therapy with either MCT or ERP. Analyses focused on treatment efficacy at post-treatment and 3-months follow-up, treatment fidelity and credibility. Participants showed a significant reduction in OCD symptoms in both treatment conditions and with no differences between MCT and ERP. Participants in the MCT condition required less face-to-face time with a therapist than those in the ERP condition. MCT and ERP were both effective with large effect sizes. There was no evidence that the two treatments lead to statistically different outcomes. Larger controlled trials are justified.",0
"INTRODUCTION: The goal of the present study was to identify the prospective relations between weight/shape and muscularity concerns and emotional problems in adolescents. METHODS: Self-report data of 966 German male and female adolescents were analyzed in a cross-lagged panel design. RESULTS: Analyses of latent means revealed significant correlations between weight/shape concern and emotional problems as well as between muscularity concern and emotional problems in both genders. Moreover, weight/shape concern predicted emotional problems prospectively, but only in girls. Regarding muscularity concern, we could not find any prospective relation with emotional problems in boys or girls from the general population. CONCLUSIONS: It is assumed that as appearance is highly relevant for the self-concept in girls, concerns about the look might promote emotional problems. Thus, weight/shape concern should be addressed in the prevention of emotional problems in adolescent girls, whereas further research is necessary investigating the contribution of muscularity concern in this context.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED) are associated with poorly controlled approach behavior toward food resulting in binge eating. Approach bias modification (ABM) may reduce these automatic action tendencies (i.e., approach bias) toward food and may thus decrease binge eating and related symptoms. METHOD: A total of 56 patients with BN/BED participated in this double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing real and sham ABM. The real ABM condition adopted an implicit learning paradigm in which participants were trained to show avoidance behavior in response to food cues. Participants in the sham condition used a similar task but were not trained to avoid food cues. Both conditions comprised 10 training sessions within 4 weeks. RESULTS: Participants in both groups experienced significant reductions in binge eating, eating disorder symptoms, trait food craving, and food cue reactivity. Real ABM tended to result in greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms than sham ABM. Food intake, approach bias, and attention bias toward food did not change. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT on ABM in eating disorders. The findings provide limited support for the efficacy of ABM in BN/BED and pose questions regarding its active ingredients and its usefulness as a stand-alone treatment for eating disorders.",0
"BACKGROUND: Shared decision making (SDM) is often advocated as an ideal for making medical decisions. Until now, however, opinions regarding which treatment situations warrant SDM have not been systematically investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine social norms regarding medical decision making, using a factorial survey design. METHODS: The factorial survey applied in this study consisted of 7 situational factors (e.g., the reason for consultation), each with 2 to 3 levels (e.g., prevention and severe disease). These factors were turned into various descriptions of treatment situations. A total of 101 physicians, 115 patients, and 113 members of self-help groups participated in the study. Each participant assessed 10 vignettes using a 5-point scale to indicate who they thought should make the decision in each specific situation. RESULTS: Most assessments across the 3 groups called for a shared decision (39%). Ordered logistic regression analysis demonstrated that, according to study participants, all 7 situational factors (reason for consultation, time frame of negative outcomes, time pressure, number of therapeutic options, side effects, scientific evidence of efficacy, and desire to participate) significantly affected how decisions regarding treatment should be made. The strongest factor was the patient's desire to participate in decision making (odds ratio = 1.84; P </= 0.001), followed by the reason for consultation (odds ratio = 0.69; P </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that there is a general desire for SDM in a variety of treatment situations. Furthermore, based on the responses of our participants, our findings also lay the framework in determining which treatment situations warrant SDM.",1
"The findings of longitudinal studies on traumatized refugees have shown that factors related to premigration, migration, and post-migration experiences determine changes in mental health over time. The primary aim of this follow-up study was to examine the potential change in the prevalence rates of probable PTSD and depression among Syrian refugees in Iraq. An unselected group of N = 92 Syrian adult refugees was recruited from Arbat camps in Sulaymaniyah Governorate in Iraq's Kurdistan Region, and then interviewed at two different time points between July 2017 and January 2019. Locally validated instruments were used to assess traumatic events and mental health symptoms. The primary results showed no significant change in the mean scores of PTSD and depression symptoms from the first measurement to the second measurement over the course of 18 months. On the individual level, no reliable change was found for either PTSD or depression symptoms in more than three-quarters of the participants (78.3% and 77.2%, respectively). New adversities and traumatic events that occurred over the 18 months between the interviews were a significant predictor of increasing trauma-related symptoms. After the flight from conflict settings, trauma-related disorders seem to be chronic for the majority of Syrian refugees. Further longitudinal studies are needed in order to identify specific risk factors that lead to maintaining or worsening mental health symptoms over time, and to explore effective therapeutic intervention methods for this traumatized population.",0
"OBJECTIVES: Previous research on stress-induced pain modulation suggests that moderate psychological stress usually leads to hyperalgesia while more severe threat results in hypoalgesia. However, existing studies often lack suitable control conditions imperative to identify mere stress effects. Similarly, research mainly focused on pure anticipation of a social threat, not taking into consideration actual experiences of social evaluation. Therefore, we set out to investigate actual social up- and downgrading combined with a standardized stress paradigm to evaluate short-term and prolonged changes in pain perception and their potential association with neuroendocrine and subjective stress parameters. METHODS: We allocated 177 healthy women to four experimental conditions, either the standard version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) followed by positive, negative or no performance feedback, or a well-matched but less demanding placebo version of the TSST. Stress responses were assessed with ratings, salivary alpha-amylase, and salivary cortisol. To capture putative effects of stress on pain, heat pain threshold, ratings of phasic heat pain stimuli, and conditioned pain modulation were measured. RESULTS: Despite a largely successful stress induction, results do not support a reliable influence of experimentally induced social stress-with or without subsequent performance feedback-on pain in women. Further, we found no clear association of pain modulation and changes in neuroendocrine or subjective stress responses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contrast previous studies, which repeatedly demonstrated stress-induced hypo- or hyperalgesia. This might be due to methodological reasons as former research was often characterized by high heterogeneity regarding the applied stressors, low sample sizes, and lacking or inconclusive control conditions. Thus, our results raise the question whether pain modulation in women by experimental psychosocial stress might have been overestimated in the past. Future research is necessary, which should employ parametric stress induction methods including well-matched control tasks, taking into consideration the participants' gender/sex and the time course of the stress response relative to pain assessment. The study is registered as DRKS00026946 at 'Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien' (DRKS) and can be also found at the World Health Organization's search portal.",0
"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe psychiatric disorder accompanied by multiple comorbidities. Neuroimaging studies have identified structural abnormalities in BPD with most findings pointing to gray matter volume reductions in the fronto-limbic network, although results remain inconsistent. Similar alterations were found in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a common comorbidity of BPD. Only a small number of studies have investigated structural differences in BPD patients regarding comorbid PTSD specifically and studies conducting additional surface analyses are scarce. We investigated structural differences in women with BPD with and without PTSD and non-patient controls. Automated voxel-based and region-based volumetric analyses were applied. Additionally, four surface-based measures were analyzed: cortical thickness, gyrification index, fractal dimension, and sulcus depth. Analyses did not identify cortical volume alterations in the fronto-limbic network. Instead, hypergyrification was detected in the right superior parietal cortex in BPD patients compared to non-patient controls. No distinction was revealed between BPD patients with and without PTSD. These findings underline the importance of a holistic investigation examining volumetric and surface measures as these might enhance the understanding of structural alterations in BPD.",0
"PURPOSE: To measure changes in markers of resident well-being over time as progressive work hours limitations (WHLs) were enforced, and to investigate resident perceptions of the 2011 WHLs. METHOD: A survey study of internal medicine residents was conducted at the University of Washington's multihospital residency program in 2012. The survey included validated well-being questions: the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the two-question PRIME-MD depression screen, and career satisfaction questions. Chi-square tests were used to compare 2012 well-being questionnaire responses against nearly identical surveys conducted in 2001 and 2004 at the same institution. In addition, residents were asked to rate the impact of WHLs on resident well-being and education as well as patient care, and to state preferences for future WHLs. RESULTS: Significantly different proportions of residents met burnout criteria across time, with fewer meeting criteria in 2012 than in 2001 (2001: 76% [87/115]; 2004: 64% [75/118]; 2012: 61% [68/112]; P = .039). Depression screening results also differed across time, with fewer screening positive in 2012 than in 2004 (2001: 45% [52/115]; 2004: 55% [65/118]; 2012 [35/112]: 31%; P = .001). Residents, especially seniors, reported perceived negative impacts of WHLs on their well-being, education, and patient care. Most senior residents favored reverting to the pre-July 2011 system of WHLs. Interns were more divided. CONCLUSIONS: Validated measures of resident well-being changed across the three time points measured. Residents had the lowest rates of burnout and depression in 2012. Resident perceptions of the 2011 WHLs, however, were generally negative.",1
"Emotion regulation in the ongoing presence of a threat is essential for adaptive behavior. Threatening situations change over time and, as a consequence, require a fine-tuned, dynamic regulation of arousal to match the current state of the environment. Constructs such as cognitive flexibility, heart rate variability, and resilience have been proposed as resources for adaptive emotion regulation, especially in a moment-to-moment fashion. Nevertheless, none of these constructs has been empirically related to the dynamic regulation of arousal as it unfolds over the course of a prolonged threatening episode. Here, we do so by placing participants in a threatening and evolving immersive virtual environment called Room 101, while recording their skin conductance. Subsequently, participants rated their subjective arousal continuously over the course of the experience. Participants who had shown greater cognitive flexibility in a separate task (i.e., fewer task-switching costs when switching to evaluating the valence of positive stimuli) showed better regulation of physiological arousal (skin conductance level), during less-threatening phases of Room 101. Individuals with higher trait resilience and individuals with higher resting heart rate variability showed more regulation in terms of their subjective arousal experience. The results indicate that emotional, cognitive, and physiological flexibility support nuanced adaptive regulation of objective and experienced arousal in the ongoing presence of threats. Furthermore, the results indicate that these forms of flexibility differentially affect automatic and objective versus reflective and subjective processes.",1
"Abstract Background Research on gender differences has found that women relate to negative voice hearing experiences with more negative emotions and report more distress due to voices, which may be rooted in differences in relating to voices. This study used a robust methodology and a large sample to explore gender differences in relating to voices and voice distress. Methods Matched samples of male ( n = 124) and female ( n = 124) voice hearers were drawn from a survey for secondary analysis. Voice severity (e.g., frequency or loudness), voice distress, and different types of dysfunctional (i.e., passive or aggressive) and functional (assertive) relating were measured. Group comparisons, mediation models, and network analyses were calculated. Results Female voice hearers reported more severe voices, more voice distress, more passive, and less assertive relating. Mediation and network analyses yielded evidence for pathways from gender to voice distress via relating and via differences in voice severity. Conclusion Gender differences in the emotional impact of voices can be partially explained by relating behavior. Psychological interventions for voice hearing could be optimized by exploring the influence of gender in the emergence of distressing voices. Nevertheless, gender differences need to be treated as one of several different possible mechanisms when working with individual patients.",1
"Research on behavioural activation (BA) for depression assumes that increasing the rate of rewarding activities leads to reduced depressive mood. Although the efficacy of BA treatment has been convincingly demonstrated, assumptions referring to the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been tested decisively yet. The Behavioural Activation Scale for Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory II were administered over 8 weeks in 161 reliably diagnosed patients with unipolar depression who underwent BA treatment in groups. Time-lagged associations between behavioural activity on depression at subsequent assessment (1 week later) and vice versa were modelled (a) with multilevel models and (b) dynamic panel models that eliminate shared constant factors and allow for reverse causation (e.g., depression affecting subsequent activation in the model for activation on depression). Both activation and depression changed significantly (model-based within effect sizes for activation = .70 and for depression = -.75). Higher activation and lower depression predict each other over time (mixed-effects, time-lagged model), but this association disappears in dynamic causal models. Change patterns were only analysed within a time frame of 1 week; smaller time intervals were not investigated. There were no objective observational data of activity patterns. In the present study, increased behavioural activity and reduced depressive mood co-occur on the week scale. They predict each other across time, but this may be due to shared causes only.",0
"BACKGROUND: Hyperconsolidation of aversive associations and poor extinction learning have been hypothesized to be crucial in the acquisition of pathological fear. Previous animal and human research points to the potential role of the catecholaminergic system, particularly noradrenaline and dopamine, in acquiring emotional memories. Here, we investigated in a between-participants design with 3 groups whether the noradrenergic alpha-2 adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine and the dopaminergic D2-receptor antagonist sulpiride modulate long-term fear conditioning and extinction in humans. METHODS: Fifty-five healthy male students were recruited. The final sample consisted of n = 51 participants who were explicitly aware of the contingencies between conditioned stimuli (CS) and unconditioned stimuli after fear acquisition. The participants were then randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups and received either yohimbine (10 mg, n = 17), sulpiride (200 mg, n = 16), or placebo (n = 18) between fear acquisition and extinction. Recall of conditioned (non-extinguished CS+ vs CS-) and extinguished fear (extinguished CS+ vs CS-) was assessed 1 day later, and a 64-channel electroencephalogram was recorded. RESULTS: The yohimbine group showed increased salivary alpha-amylase activity, confirming a successful manipulation of central noradrenergic release. Elevated fear-conditioned bradycardia and larger differential amplitudes of the N170 and late positive potential components in the event-related brain potential indicated that yohimbine treatment (compared with a placebo and sulpiride) enhanced fear recall during day 2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that yohimbine potentiates cardiac and central electrophysiological signatures of fear memory consolidation. They thereby elucidate the key role of noradrenaline in strengthening the consolidation of conditioned fear associations, which may be a key mechanism in the etiology of fear-related disorders.",1
"People with schizophrenia show marked reductions in their emotional expressiveness, generally known as blunted affect. In this study, we tested whether interaction partners would evaluate community-dwelling participants with schizophrenia less favorably than healthy controls and whether this difference would be explained by reduced smiling behavior related to schizophrenia. We also tested whether deficient affect recognition would predict reduced smiling. We created 3 study groups, consisting of 28 participants each, participants with schizophrenia (SZ), healthy controls (HC), and naive healthy interaction partners (IP). IP engaged in 2 separate same-sex dyadic interactions with matched members of each of the other 2 groups, SZ and HC, in a repeated-measures study design. During the interactions, we assessed the amount of smiling and mimicry of smiling via electromyography. After the interactions, IP rated their willingness for future interactions with SZ and HC, respectively. IP indicated less willingness for future interactions with SZ than with HC participants (d = -0.72) but SZ and HC did not differ with respect to smiling or affect recognition. Better affect recognition predicted more smiling; more smiling predicted more favorable social evaluations. Within SZ participants, disorganization symptoms but no other symptom dimensions were associated with the social evaluations. In conclusion, community-dwelling people with schizophrenia face social challenges that go beyond the adverse effects of stigmatization. Future work needs to clarify the role of different symptom dimensions and behavioral aspects contributing to the interpersonal costs of schizophrenia to derive interventions targeted at social reintegration.

"OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychological deficits and emotion dysregulation are present in symptomatic and euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. However, there is little evidence on how cognitive functioning is influenced by emotion, what the neural correlates of emotional distraction effects are, and whether such deficits are a consequence or a precursor of the disorder. The authors used functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate these questions. METHOD: fMRI was used first to localize the neural network specific to a certain cognitive task (mental arithmetic) and then to test the effect of emotional distractors on this network. Euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder (N=22), two populations at high risk for developing the disorder (unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with bipolar disorder [N=17]), and healthy participants with hypomanic personality traits [N=22]) were tested, along with three age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy comparison groups (N=22, N=17, N=24, respectively). RESULTS: There were no differences in performance or activation in the task network for mental arithmetic. However, while all participants exhibited slower responses when emotional distractors were present, this response slowing was greatly enlarged in bipolar patients. Similarly, task-related activation was generally increased under emotional distraction; however, bipolar patients exhibited a further increase in right parietal activation that correlated positively with the response slowing effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that emotional dysregulation leads to exacerbated neuropsychological deficits in bipolar patients, as evidenced by behavioral slowing and task-related hyperactivation. The lack of such a deficit in high-risk populations suggests that it occurs only after disease onset, rather than representing a vulnerability marker.",0
"BACKGROUND: Given the high prevalence of clinically relevant premenstrual symptoms and the associated impairment, there is a need for effective treatments. Initial evidence suggests cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The aim of the current randomized clinical trial was to evaluate an Internet-based CBT (iCBT) to reduce the burden of PMDD. METHODS: In all, 174 women with PMDD were recruited via newspaper articles, flyers, and social media. They were randomized to a treatment group (TG; n = 86) or waitlist control group (CG; n = 88). Women of the TG received an 8-week therapist-guided iCBT. Data were assessed before and after treatment/waiting, and 6 months after intervention with prospective symptom diaries and questionnaires in the premenstrual phase. Treatment effects and moderators were analysed using hierarchical linear modelling. RESULTS: Significant time x group interaction effects on functional impairment and psychological impairment, impact on everyday life, symptom intensity, and symptom disability in favour of the TG indicated the efficacy of the treatment. Follow-up assessments demonstrated treatment effects to be stable until 6 months after treatment. Additionally, significant interactions with moderator variables were found. In the TG, higher levels of active coping and lower levels of support-seeking coping were associated with stronger improvement in interference in everyday life and symptom intensity. In addition, lower levels of perceived stress were associated with stronger improvement in functional impairment. CONCLUSION: The iCBT was highly effective in reducing the burden of PMDD. It appears to be particularly important to address coping styles and stress management in the treatment.",1
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Comorbidity between major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent but reasons for this association are unclear. Rumination may activate metacognitive beliefs that contribute to the development and maintenance of rumination and depression. Negative metacognitions can further lead to other dysfunctional coping strategies (i.e., consumption of alcohol). We examined whether alcohol reduces (state) metacognitions, rumination and other disorder-specific processes in a group of individuals suffering from MDD. METHOD: In an experiment with three randomized conditions we investigated whether the consumption of alcohol, placebo or no alcohol (orange juice) affects (meta-)cognitions, depressive symptoms and / or psychophysiological variables while participants ruminate. RESULTS: Voluntary rumination increased self-reported sadness, tension and rumination, tensed facial muscles and increased heart rate, but did not affect (state) metacognitions and heart rate variability. The consumption of alcohol did not influence rumination, metacognitions, depressive or psychophysiological measures. LIMITATIONS: We recruited a depressed population but excluded pathological alcohol use due to ethical considerations. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that alcohol consumption affects rumination, metacognitions and other disorder-specific processes in MDD. However, rumination had a negative effect on various depression-specific processes, although it did not activate (negative state) metacognitions.",0
"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by perceived appearance-related defects, often tied to aspects of the face or head (e.g., acne). Deficits in decoding emotional expressions have been examined in several psychological disorders including BDD. Previous research indicates that BDD is associated with impaired facial emotion recognition, particularly in situations that involve the BDD sufferer him/herself. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the ability to read other people's emotions among 31 individuals with BDD, and 31 mentally healthy controls. We applied the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task, in which participants are presented with a series of pairs of eyes, one at a time, and are asked to identify the emotion that describes the stimulus best. The groups did not differ with respect to decoding other people's emotions by looking into their eyes. Findings are discussed in light of previous research examining emotion recognition in BDD.",0
"Background: Outcome predictions allow to improve psychotherapy and to increase economic benefit. The efficient translation into practice requires simple prediction methods. The present study evaluates the prediction of treatment outcome based on initial distress level. Methods: Routine data of a university psychotherapy outpatient clinic were used (N = 3,145, Mage = 35.8, 67% female). Low versus high distress patients (classified by overall psychological distress, symptomatology, and previous treatment) were compared on total reduction in psychopathology, (early) response, remission, and premature treatment discontinuation using t tests and logistic regressions. Response and remission were assessed via relative (percentage improvement) and absolute measures (Reliable Change Index; RCI). Results: Distress level was inversely related to percentage improvement (OR = 0.62) and remission (OR = 0.34). It was positively related to total reduction in psychopathology (d = 0.63), RCI response (OR = 2.37), and treatment discontinuation (OR = 2.15). Early response and treatment discontinuation partially mediated the relationship between distress level and treatment outcome. Conclusions: Treatment success tends to be lower when initial distress is high, but this finding appears contingent on the operationalization of treatment outcome. The presented classification approach is easy to implement in practice and may be useful in order to counter an excessive workload in psychotherapy trainees.",1
"BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled trial examines the relative efficacy of a disorder-specific treatment program (TrennungsAngstprogramm Fur Familien [TAFF]; English: Separation Anxiety Family Therapy) for children suffering from separation anxiety disorder (SAD) in comparison with a general anxiety program. METHOD: Sixty-four children aged 8-13 with SAD and their parents were assigned either to a 16-session disorder-specific SAD treatment program, including parent training and classical cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) components (TAFF), or to a general child-focused 16-week comparison group (Coping Cat [CC]) without any parent training. Diagnoses and parent cognitions were assessed at baseline and at follow-ups. Global success ratings were collected at end of treatment and at follow-up. Ratings for anxiety, impairment/distress, and life quality were collected at Baseline 1, again after a 4-week waiting period, repeatedly throughout treatment, at 4 weeks, and at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: The response rate (no SAD diagnosis) at 4-week follow-up among the 52 treatment completers was 87.5% vs. 82.1% (TAFF vs. CC; intent-to-treat: 67.7% vs. 69.7%). At 1-year follow-up, the response was 83.3% versus 75% (TAFF vs. CC; intent to treat: 64.5% vs. 63.6%). Differences were nonsignificant. Results from rating scales indicated improvement for both groups across time points and assessment areas, with few between-group differences, and some small effects favoring the TAFF program. Both treatment programs yielded a reduction in parental dysfunctional beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a slight advantage of the TAFF program over a general child-based treatment for SAD. However, these differences were less strong than hypothesized, indicating that the inclusion of parent training does not add large effects to classical child-based CBT in school-age children with SAD.

"Defeatist performance beliefs (DPBs) are associated with the severe impairments in functioning of patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This association has been found to be mediated by amotivation, a core aspect of negative symptoms. Although causality is assumed, longitudinal evidence for this is lacking. The current study aimed to extend previous findings by investigating both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between DPBs, motivational impairments and functioning in a sample of patients with psychotic disorders (N=58). We hypothesized, that DPBs would be related to functioning in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses and that this link would be mediated by motivational impairments. Data was assessed at baseline and post-treatment in a trial on the effects of cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis. At baseline, amotivation mediated the association between DPBs and functioning. From baseline to post-treatment, reduction of amotivation was associated with improvement of functioning significantly, whereas reduction of DPBs was unrelated to improvements in functioning or amotivation. The findings suggest that improvement in amotivation accounts for favorable treatment outcomes in regard to functioning but question the causal role of DPBs in negative symptoms and functioning.",0
"Emotional stimuli attract attention and lead to increased activity in the visual cortex. The present study investigated the impact of personal relevance on emotion processing by presenting emotional words within sentences that referred to participants' significant others or to unknown agents. In event-related potentials, personal relevance increased visual cortex activity within 100 ms after stimulus onset and the amplitudes of the Late Positive Complex (LPC). Moreover, personally relevant contexts gave rise to augmented pupillary responses and higher arousal ratings, suggesting a general boost of attention and arousal. Finally, personal relevance increased emotion-related ERP effects starting around 200 ms after word onset; effects for negative words compared to neutral words were prolonged in duration. Source localizations of these interactions revealed activations in prefrontal regions, in the visual cortex and in the fusiform gyrus. Taken together, these results demonstrate the high impact of personal relevance on reading in general and on emotion processing in particular.",1
"When a group engages in immoral behavior, group members face the whistleblower's dilemma: the conflict between remaining loyal to the group and standing up for other moral concerns. This study examines the developmental origins of this dilemma by investigating 5-year-olds' whistleblowing on their in- vs. outgroup members' moral transgression. Children (n = 96) watched puppets representing their ingroup vs. outgroup members commit either a mild or a severe transgression. After the mild transgression, children tattled on both groups equally often. After the severe transgression, however, they were significantly less likely to blow the whistle on their ingroup than on the outgroup. These results suggest that children have a strong tendency to act on their moral concerns, but can adjust their behavior according to their group's need: When much is at stake for the ingroup (i.e., after a severe moral transgression), children's behavior is more likely to be guided by loyalty.",0
"AIMS: We investigate reasons for persistent medication refusal in schizophrenia spectrum disorders and test whether factors that speak for a rational decision, such as negative experiences with medication or low symptom distress predict medication refusal, even after taking differences in insight into account. METHOD: We included 45 participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, of which 20 had refused antipsychotic medication for at least three months and assessed reasons for taking or not taking medication, labeling condition as mental disorder (""insight""), experiences with the previous treatments, symptoms and symptom distress, positive and negative consequences and experiences of psychosis, causal beliefs, therapeutic relationships with previous clinicians and attitudes towards medication. RESULTS: Groups did not differ in symptom severity but medication refusers reported significantly less insight, less satisfaction with their most-recent psychiatrist and with previous medication, and more negative beliefs about harmful effects of medication. They also felt less informed about medication. After controlling for insight, the perceived helpfulness of the previous treating psychiatrist (OR=0.30, z=5.58, p=0.018) and of previous medication (OR=0.27, z=6.87, p=0.009) and feeling insufficiently informed about medication (OR=0.53, z=3. 85, p=0.050) significantly predicted medication discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Building rapport with patients with a different view of the nature of their condition and encouraging informed decisions on medication are likely to improve medication adherence. However, the findings also suggest that refusing medication after a phase of initial adherence is also the consequence of negative experiences with medication and could result from weighing the pros against the cons.",0
"BACKGROUND: Relapse rates in bulimia nervosa (BN) are high even after successful treatment, but patients often hesitate to take up further treatment. An easily accessible program might help maintain treatment gains. Encouraged by the effects of Web-based eating disorder prevention programs, we developed a manualized, Web-based aftercare program (IN@) for women with BN following inpatient treatment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of the web-based guided, 9-month, cognitive-behavioral aftercare program IN@ for women with BN following inpatient treatment. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled efficacy trial in 253 women with DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition) BN and compared the results of IN@ with treatment as usual (TAU). Assessments were carried out at hospital admission (T0), hospital discharge/baseline (T1), postintervention (T2; 9 months after baseline), 9-month follow-up (T3; 18 months after baseline). The primary outcome, abstinence from binge eating and compensatory behaviors during the 2 months preceding T2, was analyzed by intention to treat, using logistic regression analyses. Frequencies of binge eating and vomiting episodes, and episodes of all compensatory behaviors were analyzed using mixed effects models. RESULTS: At T2, data from 167 women were available. There were no significant differences in abstinence rates between the TAU group (n=24, 18.9%) and the IN@ group (n=27, 21.4%; odds ratio, OR=1.29; P=.44). The frequency of vomiting episodes in the IN@ group was significantly (46%) lower than in the TAU group (P=.003). Moderator analyses revealed that both at T2 and T3, women of the intervention group who still reported binge eating and compensatory behaviors after inpatient treatment benefited from IN@, whereas women who were already abstinent after the inpatient treatment did not (P=.004; P=.002). Additional treatment utilization was high in both groups between baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, data from this study suggest moderate effects of IN@. High rates of outpatient treatment utilization after inpatient treatment may have obscured potential intervention effects on abstinence. An aftercare intervention might be more beneficial as part of a stepped-care approach.

"Cognitive control protects processing of relevant information from interference by irrelevant information. The level of this processing selectivity can be flexibly adjusted to different control demands (e.g., frequency of conflict) associated with a certain context, leading to the formation of specific context-control associations. In the present study we investigated the robustness and transferability of the acquired context-control demands to new situations. In three experiments, we used a version of the context-specific proportion congruence (CSPC) paradigm, in which each context (e.g., location) is associated with a specific conflict frequency, determining high and low control demands. In a learning phase, associations between context and control demands were established. In a subsequent transfer block, stimulus-response mappings, whole task sets, or context-control demands changed. Results showed an impressive robustness of context-control associations, as context-specific adjustments of control from the learning phase were virtually unaffected by new stimuli and tasks in the transfer block. Only a change of the context-control demand eliminated the context-specific adjustment of control. These findings suggest that context-control associations that have proven to be adaptive in the past are continuously applied despite major changes in the task structure as long as the context-control associations remain the same.",0
"BACKGROUND: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are characterized by fears of negative evaluation by others (related to one's own incompetence or flawed appearance, respectively). Previous research has shown that individuals with SAD and BDD exhibit difficulty identifying facial expressions and interpretive biases for threat in social situations. The current study aimed at further investigating social cognition in SAD, BDD, and mentally healthy controls (35 individuals per group, respectively). Further, 35 individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as a clinical control group not characterized by evaluation fears were included. METHODS: The Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) was applied. It consists of 45 video sequences depicting interactions among four people at a dinner party. Participants are instructed to evaluate each scenario with respect to the characters' emotions, thoughts, and intentions from a bystander perspective (i.e. other-referent context). RESULTS: Only the socially anxious groups (SAD and BDD) were overall less accurate than the other groups in correctly interpreting the social situations, whereas no difference was obtained between the OCD and the control group. Further analyses indicated that the SAD and BDD groups were less accurate in identifying other people's thoughts and intentions, whereas, again, no difference was observed between the OCD and control groups. In addition, the SAD group was less accurate in inferring thoughts and intentions than the OCD group. Interestingly, the groups did not differ with respect to identifying other people's emotions. CONCLUSIONS: These results mostly confirm existing cognitive-behavioral models of SAD and BDD emphasizing that biased interpretation of what others think or intend is one of the key factors maintaining social anxiety and appearance-related concerns. Our study shows that this bias generalizes to social situations in which individuals take a third-person observer perspective.",0
"INTRODUCTION: Self-stigma arising from public stigma is a heavy burden for people suffering from mental health problems. Both public stigma and self-stigma encompass the same three elements: stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. Public stigma has already been successfully explored by the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) and the Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes (BIAS) map. However, this is not the case for self-stigma. Therefore, this is the first study that applies SCM and the BIAS map to self-stigma by examining whether the effects of self-stereotypes on self-directed discrimination would be mediated by self-directed prejudices in people with mental health problems. METHOD: Within a total sample of N = 823 participants, who took part in an online survey, n = 336 people reported mental health problems. Mental health and self-stereotypes (warmth, competence), self-directed prejudice (negative emotions), and self-directed discrimination (active/passive self-harm) were assessed. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling supported the hypothesis that the stereotype dimensions warmth and competence negatively related to prejudice, while stronger prejudice was associated with more discrimination (active/passive self-harm). Prejudice fully mediated the relationship between stereotypes and discrimination. The indirect effects of warmth and competence on active and passive self-harm were moderated by competence and warmth. DISCUSSION: Implications for further research on self-stigma and the usage of SCM and BIAS map are discussed.",1
