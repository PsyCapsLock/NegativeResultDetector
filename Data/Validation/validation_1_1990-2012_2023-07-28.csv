"Health professionals are in need of more information about the weight-loss outcomes of using commercial weight-loss programs. A commercial behavioral intervention program using meal replacements, fruits, and vegetables (MR-FV) was compared with usual-care weight-loss counseling. Obese volunteers were randomly allocated to usual-care weight-loss counseling or participation in an MR-FV standardized behavioral education program. The MR-FV group attended weekly weight-loss classes for 16 weeks and weekly maintenance classes for 8 weeks. Obese women or men aged 20 to 65 years were recruited from the community through a commercial program provided at a university medical center. The control group (C group) received weight-management counseling from an experienced dietitian, while the intervention group (MR-FV group) participated in scheduled behavioral weight-loss classes. The MR-FV group participants were encouraged to consume 3 shakes, 2 entrées, and 5 servings of fruits or vegetables daily, and achieve physical activity goals (expend ≥ 8.4 mJ/week); they kept records and placed midweek phone calls. The C group was counseled at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. Both groups were seen at baseline, and 8, 16, and 24 weeks for assessment of weight, risk factors, and side effects. The primary data analysis was intention to treat. Thirteen of 16 subjects (81.3%) in the C group and 18 of 22 subjects (81.8%) in the MR-FV group completed the 24-week study. Mean weight losses for the C group were: 1.3% (standard error [SE], 0.9) at 8 weeks; 0.7% (SE, 1.1) at 16 weeks; and 0.7% (SE, 1.1) or 0.7 kg at 24 weeks. Mean weight losses for the MR-FV group were: 8.5% (SE, 0.6) at 8 weeks, 12.5% (SE, 0.9) at 16 weeks, and 13.9% (SE, 1.1) or 13.7 kg at 24 weeks. A behavioral intervention with a low-energy diet including 5 meal replacements and 5 servings of fruits or vegetables enabled obese individuals to lose 13 kg more than control subjects over a 24-week period.",1
Changes in immunologic status were evaluated in 25 HIV-infected men randomly assigned to a 10-week stress management intervention or a wait-list control condition. The authors monitored changes in number of transitional naive T cells (CD4(+)CD45RA(+)CD29(+)) over 6-12 months after the completion of the intervention. Men receiving stress management had higher CD4(+) CD45RA(+)CD29(+) cell counts at follow-up than did the control subjects. This difference was independent of initial number of naive T cells and HIV virus load. Stress management is associated with immunologic reconstitution in HIV-positive gay men.,1
"The purpose of this study was to compare a relatively new therapeutic option for substance abuse treatment, Health Realization, and 12-Step approaches offered in women's residential programs. The study was sponsored by a large California county's Department of Alcohol and Drug Services, which had offered Health Realization treatment for a number of years. This study constitutes the first systematic evaluation of Health Realization as a substance abuse treatment program for adult women in a residential treatment setting. This was a randomized study with two observations-admission and 9 months post-admission. The results showed that clients in both Health Realization and 12-Step treatment exhibited comparable outcomes on domains such as substance use, criminal justice involvement, employment, housing, adverse effects of substance use and psychological well being. Substance use declined significantly between admission and follow-up in both treatment groups, irrespective of duration of treatment. Similarly, adverse effects of substance use declined between admission and 9-month follow-up. Health Realization and 12-Step treatment offered comparable benefits for women in residential substance abuse treatment programs.",1
"The relationship between psychopathology and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia is of interest, both for an understanding of the nature of the disease, and for comprehensive treatment planning. The aim of this study was to investigate how psychiatric symptoms affect, and are affected by, cognitive remediation. Fifty-four psychiatric inpatients received either cognitive remediation exercises (remediation group) or no cognitive intervention (control group). The subjects' scores on tests of cognition and on the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) were measured before, after the 10 session treatment, and again 4 weeks post treatment. Only the remediation group showed significant and persistent improvement on all three PANSS Subscales as well as on the Positive Symptoms and Depression Factors. There were no significant between-group differences on any PANSS pre/posttreatment change scores. Baseline measures of psychopathology did not correlate meaningfully with amount of change made on cognitive measures after rehabilitation. A brief 10-session course of cognitive remediation is sufficient to benefit cognition and has some positive effects on psychopathology as measured by the PANSS, but does not add significantly to the effects of standard psychiatric treatment on psychopathology. Furthermore, psychiatric symptom profile is not predictive of the degree to which cognitive symptoms respond to cognitive remediation. The differential impact of cognitive remediation on cognition and psychopathology may imply that psychopathology and cognitive functioning follow fairly independent treatment courses.",0
"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two brief interventions and the inclusion of a 1-month booster session with college students who were referred to attend alcohol education following an alcohol-related incident. Participants (N=225; 48.9% male) were randomly assigned to receive one session of a Brief Motivational Interview (BMI) or computer-delivered intervention (CDI) with the Alcohol 101 CD-ROM. Participants were also randomly assigned to booster/no booster. At 3-month follow up, participants in BMI reported greater help seeking and use of behavioral strategies to moderate drinking. At 12-month follow up, BMI participants were drinking more frequently and CDI participants were consuming a greater number of drinks per occasion than at baseline. Mediation analyses showed that the use of specific behavioral strategies mediated the effect of the BMI condition on drinking volume. There was no intervention effect on alcohol problems, and the booster condition did not significantly affect outcomes. Promoting specific behaviors in the context of in-person brief interventions may be a promising approach to reducing drinking volume among identified at-risk students.",0
"A family-based treatment for childhood anxiety was evaluated. Children (n = 79) aged 7 to 14 who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for separation anxiety, overanxious disorder, or social phobia were randomly allocated to 3 treatment conditions: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), CBT plus family management (CBT + FAM), and waiting list. The effectiveness of the interventions was evaluated at posttreatment and at 6 and 12 months follow-up. The results indicated that across treatment conditions, 69.8% of the children no longer fulfilled diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder, compared with 26% of the waiting-list children. At the 12-month follow-up, 70.3% of the children in the CBT group and 95.6% of the children in the CBT + FAM group did not meet criteria. Comparisons of children receiving CBT with those receiving CBT + FAM on self-report measures and clinician ratings indicated added benefits from CBT + FAM treatment. Age and gender interacted with treatment condition, with younger children and female participants responding better to the CBT + FAM condition.",1
"A mixed methods research design was used to investigate the effects of a music therapy CD (MTCD) creation intervention on pediatric oncology patients' distress and coping during their first radiation therapy treatment. The music therapy method involved children creating a music CD using interactive computer-based music software, which was ""remixed"" by the music therapist-researcher to extend the musical material. Eleven pediatric radiation therapy outpatients aged 6 to 13 years were randomly assigned to either an experimental group, in which they could create a music CD prior to their initial treatment to listen to during radiation therapy, or to a standard care group. Quantitative and qualitative analyses generated multiple perceptions from the pediatric patients, parents, radiation therapy staff, and music therapist-researcher. Ratings of distress during initial radiation therapy treatment were low for all children. The comparison between the two groups found that 67% of the children in the standard care group used social withdrawal as a coping strategy, compared to 0% of the children in the music therapy group; this trend approached significance (p = 0.076). MTCD creation was a fun, engaging, and developmentally appropriate intervention for pediatric patients, which offered a positive experience and aided their use of effective coping strategies to meet the demands of their initial radiation therapy treatment.",1
"The authors used the ""bogus-item"" methodology originally used by C. Wickless and I. Kirsch (1989) to examine the effects of response expectancy manipulations on subjects' subsequently measured hypnotizability scores. The results of the first experiment failed to replicate Wickless and Kirsch's (1989) findings that surreptitious confirmation of suggested items (the bogus-item manipulation) leads to higher scores on subsequently measured hypnotic responsiveness. The second experiment tested if, in fact, response expectancies were enhanced by the bogus-item manipulation, and the manipulation's effect on behavioral and subjective responsiveness to hypnosis was reexamined. A significant increase was found in response expectancies as a result of the bogus item expectancy manipulation, but again no evidence that this manipulation led to increased hypnotic responsiveness was found. Hypnotic responsiveness may not be as reactive to expectancy manipulations as previously claimed, and it is suggested that the notion of hypnotic responsiveness as a trait-like ability is viable.",0
"Using a sample of over 125 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who were treated with cognitive therapy administered in small groups, we sought to predict end of treatment and 3-month follow-up improvement in two changes indices of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (Pain/Discomfort Index which assessed change in abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness and bloating and Bowel Regularity Index which assessed change in diarrhea and constipation). We also sought to predict scores on IBS specific quality of life (QOL) and overall level of psychological distress using the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Significant, but modest, levels of prediction were found for prediction of improvement in GI symptoms (4-15% of variance). Stronger significant prediction was obtained for the QOL and global psychological distress measure with R(2)'s ranging from 0.36 to 0.50. A wide variety of demographic, GI symptom, psychological status and psychiatric status variables entered the final prediction equations.",1
"Prediction of treatment outcome has important clinical consequences. Personality factors have rarely been tested as predictors of acute outcome. Personality, demographic and illness-related characteristics were assessed at baseline for prediction of outcome of treatment in depressed out-patients. One hundred and ninety-three patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were enrolled in a 12 to 16 week trial. The treatment consisted of nefazodone, nefazodone in combination with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), IPT in combination with placebo and IPT alone. Demographic and illness related variables were collected at baseline. Personality was assessed using the NEO-FFI. This instrument measures five dimensions of personality. A hierarchical logistic regression was carried out to test for significant predictors of remittance. Further a multiple regression analysis was used to investigate variables predictive of changes on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as dependent variable. Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship of outcome with severity, duration of index episode, and use of medical services (UMS). None of the personality variables was predictive of outcome. Regression analyses showed that these disease related variables each uniquely predicted outcome, but that personality factors did not significantly contribute to the prediction model. The study was carried out in secondary and tertiary care centers and may not be generalizable to other populations. Personality dimensions were assessed with a self-report instrument and may be prone to bias. Severity and duration of the index episode, and to a lesser extent, UMS, and not personality factors, predict outcome in the short term treatment of MDD.",0
"A portable practice of repeating a mantram-a sacred word or phrase-has been shown to reduce the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in veterans with military trauma. It is thought that the intervention re-directs attention and initiates relaxation to decrease symptom severity, but there may be other mechanisms that may contribute to this improvement. We tested the hypothesis that increases in existential spiritual wellbeing (ESWB) would mediate reductions in self-reported PTSD symptoms following a group mantram intervention. Veterans diagnosed with PTSD from war-related trauma completed 6 weeks of case management plus a group mantram intervention (n = 66) as part of a randomized trial. Measures included PTSD Checklist (PCL) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Wellbeing. Path analysis was conducted on those who completed treatment to assess ESWB as a possible mediator of change in PCL from baseline to post-treatment. A significant indirect effect, -2.24, 95% CI (-4.17, -1.05) of the mantram intervention on PCL change was found. The path from the mantram intervention to ESWB change was significant and positive (B = 4.89, p < 0.0001), and the path from ESWB change to PCL change was significant and negative (B = -0.46, p = 0.001), thus supporting the hypothesis. Findings suggest that one contributing mechanism that partially explains how the mantram intervention reduces PTSD symptom severity in veterans may be by increasing levels of ESWB.",1
"Because of the increased cognitive resources required to process negations, past research has shown that explicit attitude measures are more sensitive to negations than implicit attitude measures. The current work demonstrated that the differential impact of negations on implicit and explicit attitude measures was moderated by (a) the extent to which the negation was made salient and (b) the amount of cognitive resources available during attitude formation. When negations were less visually salient, explicit but not implicit attitude measures reflected the intended valence of the negations. When negations were more visually salient, both explicit and implicit attitude measures reflected the intended valence of the negations, but only when perceivers had ample cognitive resources during encoding. Competing models of negation processing, schema-plus-tag and fusion, were examined to determine how negation salience impacts the processing of negations.",0
"The aims of this study were to examine the effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training intervention among cancer patients on levels of salivary cortisol, and further to explore if changes in psychological variables mediate intervention effects on cortisol. Patients with a previous cancer diagnosis (n = 71) were recruited and randomized into an intervention group or a waiting-list control group. The intervention consisted of an 8-week MBSR training course. There were no overall effects of the intervention on cortisol levels at 3-month or 6-month follow-up. However, a significant effect of moderation was found showing a different intervention effect on awakening cortisol among participants with varying baseline level of cortisol. Among those with initial low levels of cortisol, there was an increase from baseline to 3-month follow-up, and among those with initial high levels there was a decreased level of cortisol at 3-month follow-up. There was no association between changes in psychological outcomes and cortisol levels. The results suggest an adjustment of cortisol levels as a result of MBSR. The study gives preliminary support indicating that MBSR can influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis functioning. The importance of these findings for future research in the field of mindfulness and stress reduction among cancer patients are discussed.",0
"To determine whether massage significantly reduces anxiety, pain, and muscular tension and enhances relaxation compared with an equivalent period of rest time after cardiac surgery. The feasibility of delivering the treatment, effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, and patient satisfaction were also assessed. Elective cardiac surgery patients were randomized to receive massage or rest time at 2 points after surgery. Visual analog scales were used to measure pain, anxiety, relaxation, muscular tension, and satisfaction. Heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were measured before and after treatment. Focus groups and feedback were used to collect qualitative data about clinical significance and feasibility. A total of 152 patients (99% response rate) participated. Massage therapy produced a significantly greater reduction in pain (P = .001), anxiety (P < .0001), and muscular tension (P = .002) and increases in relaxation (P < .0001) and satisfaction (P = .016) compared to the rest time. No significant differences were seen for heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Pain was significantly reduced after massage on day 3 or 4 (P < .0001) and day 5 or 6 (P = .003). The control group experienced no significant change at either time. Anxiety (P < .0001) and muscular tension (P < .0001) were also significantly reduced in the massage group at both points. Relaxation was significantly improved on day 3 or 4 for both groups (massage, P < .0001; rest time, P = .006), but only massage was effective on day 5 or 6 (P < .0001). Nurses and physiotherapists observed patient improvements and helped facilitate delivery of the treatment by the massage therapists on the ward. Massage therapy significantly reduced the pain, anxiety, and muscular tension and improves relaxation and satisfaction after cardiac surgery.",0
"Previous research and anecdotal reports have suggested that when certain teaching approaches are used, students not only learn more but also experience greater satisfaction with the training process. This study examined the effects of integrative-learning-based (IL) training in relation to lecture-based training. Employees enrolled in a 3-day manufacturing resource planning training course were randomly assigned to either IL or traditional training. Subjects reacted more favorably to IL-based training. Trained subjects performed significantly better than those in a no-treatment control group, but no differences were noted between training interventions.",0
"This study explores the relationships between therapist variables (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] competence, and CBT adherence) and clinical outcomes of computer-assisted CBT for anxiety disorders delivered by novice therapists in a primary care setting. Participants were recruited for a randomized controlled trial of evidence-based treatment, including computer-assisted CBT, versus treatment as usual. Therapists (anxiety clinical specialists; ACSs) were nonexpert clinicians, many of whom had no prior experience in delivering psychotherapy (and in particular, very little experience with CBT). Trained raters reviewed randomly selected treatment sessions from 176 participants and rated therapists on measures of CBT competence and CBT adherence. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups on measures of anxiety, depression, and functioning, and an average Reliable Change Index was calculated as a composite measure of outcome. CBT competence and CBT adherence were entered as predictors of outcome, after controlling for baseline covariates. Higher CBT competence was associated with better clinical outcomes whereas CBT adherence was not. Also, CBT competence was inversely correlated with years of clinical experience and trended (not significantly, though) down as the study progressed. CBT adherence was inversely correlated with therapist tenure in the study. Therapist competence was related to improved clinical outcomes when CBT for anxiety disorders was delivered by novice clinicians with technology assistance. The results highlight the value of the initial training for novice therapists as well as booster training to limit declines in therapist adherence.",0
"Selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive therapies are effective in the treatment of anxiety and depression. Previous research suggests that both forms of treatments may work by altering cognitive biases in the processing of affective information. The current study assessed the effects of combining an SSRI with a cognitive intervention on measures of affective processing bias and resilience to external challenge. A total of 62 healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive either 7 days of citalopram (20 mg) or placebo capsules while also completing either an active or a control version of a computerized cognitive bias training task. After treatment, standard measures of affective processing bias were collected. Participants' resilience to external stress was also tested by measuring the increase in negative symptoms induced by a negative mood induction. Participants who received both citalopram and the active cognitive bias training task showed a smaller alteration in emotional memory and categorization bias than did those who received either active intervention singly. The degree to which memory for negative information was altered by citalopram predicted participants' resistance to the negative mood induction. These results suggest that co-administration of an SSRI and a cognitive training intervention can reduce the effectiveness of either treatment alone in terms of anxiety- and depression-relevant emotional processing. More generally, the findings suggest that pinpointing the cognitive actions of treatments may inform future development of combination strategies in mental health.",1
"The authors compared a combination of clomipramine and psychodynamic psychotherapy with clomipramine alone in a randomized controlled trial among patients with major depression. Seventy-four patients between the ages of 20 and 65 years who were assigned to ten weeks of acute outpatient treatment for major depression were studied. Bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms, severe substance dependence, organic disorder, past intolerance to clomipramine, and mental retardation were exclusion criteria. Marked improvement was noted in both treatment groups. Combined treatment was associated with less treatment failure and better work adjustment at ten weeks and with better global functioning and lower hospitalization rates at discharge. A cost savings of 2,311 dollars per patient in the combined treatment group, associated with lower rates of hospitalization and fewer lost work days, exceeded the expenditures related to providing psychotherapy. Provision of supplemental psychodynamic psychotherapy to patients with major depression who are receiving antidepressant medication is cost-effective.",1
"Tobacco use is the single most important preventable cause of death in military personnel. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of two behavioral interventions when added to nicotine-replacement therapy on smoking cessation. The sample of 512 included 52% active duty military, 29% family, 11% retirees, and 8% Department of Defense civilians. There was a main effect of compliance at the end of the program (EOP); 69% of those who attended 75% of the classes were abstinent from tobacco; regression analysis found the more intensive program to be twice as effective at EOP and at 3 months, an outcome not continued at 6 months. The longer, more intensive Vanderbilt University Medical Center program was significantly more effective at helping the civilian portion of the population (85% versus 60% in the American Cancer Society program) but not the active duty participants.",0
"Patients with various medical conditions benefit from eliciting the relaxation response (RR), using a variety of techniques, but few studies have focused on chronic heart failure (CHF). We evaluated the efficacy of an RR intervention program on the quality of life (QOL) and exercise capacity of CHF patients by conducting a single-blind, 3-arm, randomized, controlled trial. Between April 2000 and June 2002, we enrolled 95 patients with moderate severity CHF from the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System. Patients in the study intervention group attended a weekly RR group for 15 weeks and were requested to practice the techniques at home twice a day. A 15-week cardiac education (EDU) program was used as an alternative intervention, and usual care (UC) was the control group. The QOL questionnaires and a bicycle test were administered at baseline and after intervention or 15 to 19 weeks. Eighty-three (87%) of the 95 enrolled patients completed both baseline and post-intervention QOL measures (31 RR, 24 EDU, and 28 UC). No dropout bias was observed. The RR group had significantly better QOL change scores in peace-spiritual scales than did the UC group (P = .02), adjusting for baseline scores, time between assessments, age, education, diet, and medication, whereas no significant difference was observed between the EDU and UC groups. A similar trend was observed in emotional QOL (RR and UC group comparison, P = .07). No statistically significant intervention effect on physical QOL or exercise capacity was observed. A short RR intervention can improve some aspects of QOL in CHF patients.",0
"This study's aim was to prospectively examine and identify a model of demographic, clinical, and attitudinal variables that impact improvement among patients with panic disorder. Subjects were 232 primary care patients meeting criteria for DSM-IV panic disorder. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to a collaborative care intervention or to treatment as usual. Assessments occurred at 3-month intervals during the course of 1 year. In final multivariate logistic regression models, patients with higher anxiety sensitivity and higher neuroticism scores at baseline were less likely to show clinical improvement (using a criterion of 20 or less on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index) at 3 months. Those who were non-white, had higher anxiety sensitivity, and higher overall phobic avoidance at baseline were less likely to show clinical improvement at 12 months. A greater understanding of these predictors may help clinicians identify who is at greatest risk for persistent panic-related symptoms and to plan the intensity of interventions accordingly.",1
"The clinical effectiveness of group and individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa (BN) was compared. Sixty BN patients from hospitals and general practitioners in Sydney, Australia, were allocated randomly to group or individual CBT. Forty-four completed treatment (n = 22 in group CBT and n = 22 in individual CBT). Patients were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment, and at 3 and 6 months follow-up with the Eating Disorder Examination-12 and self-report questionnaires examining weight and shape attitudes (Eating Disorder Inventory-2), social adjustment (Social Adjustment Scale-Modified), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and general psychopathology (Symptom Checklist 90R). The effects of group and individual CBT were equivalent on most measures. However, a significantly greater proportion of individual CBT patients than group CBT patients were abstinent from bulimic behaviors at posttreatment, but not at follow-up. This has implications for the delivery of cost-effective and clinically effective treatment for BN.",0
"This study tested the effectiveness of a mutual support multiple-family-group intervention for schizophrenia in terms of improvements in patients' psychosocial functioning, use of mental health services, and rehospitalization compared with a psychoeducation intervention and standard care. A controlled trial was conducted in a sample of 96 Chinese families who were caring for a relative with schizophrenia in Hong Kong. The families were randomly assigned to one of three groups: mutual support (N=32), psychoeducation (N=33), and standard care (N=31). The interventions were delivered at two psychiatric outpatient clinics over a six-month period. The mutual support and psychoeducation interventions consisted of 12 group sessions every two weeks, each lasting about two hours. The mutual support group was a peer-led group designed to provide information, emotional support, and coping skills for caregiving in stages. The psychoeducation group was a professional-led group designed to educate families about the biological basis of schizophrenia and treatment and to improve illness management and coping skills. The standard care group and the other two groups received routine psychiatric outpatient care during the intervention. Data analyses of multiple outcomes over one-year follow-up were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Multivariate analyses of variance showed that the mutual support intervention was associated with consistently greater improvements in patients' functioning and rehospitalization and stable use of mental health services over the follow-up period compared with the other two interventions. The study provides evidence that mutual support groups can be an effective family intervention for Chinese persons with mental illness in terms of improving patients' functioning and hospitalization without increasing their use of mental health services.",1
"Although the efficacy of Cognitive Therapy (CT) for depression is well documented, questions remain about the conditions under which CT is maximally effective, and the mechanisms by which CT is efficacious. This study examined the role of extreme responding (ER) as a mediator and predictor of relapse, as well as a predictor of acute treatment outcome. To test mediation, ER of participants in CT was compared to ER of participants receiving Behavioral Activation (BA). Results indicated that ER was not a mediator of relapse in either condition. Both CT and BA showed reductions in depression severity, however neither group showed significant changes in ER over the course of treatment. Finally, ER did not predict or moderate acute treatment outcome. The implications of these results, strengths and limitations of the current study, and future research directions are discussed.",0
"Obese individuals experience pervasive stigmatization. Interventions attempting to reduce obesity stigma by targeting its origins have yielded mixed results. This randomized, controlled study examined the effectiveness of two interventions to reduce obesity stigma: cognitive dissonance and social consensus. Participants were college undergraduate students (N = 64, 78% women, mean age = 21.2 years, mean BMI = 23.1 kg/m2) of diverse ethnicities. Obesity stigma (assessed with the Antifat Attitudes Test (AFAT)) was assessed at baseline (Visit 1) and 1 week later, immediately following the intervention (Visit 2). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups where they received standardized written feedback on their obesity stigma levels. Cognitive dissonance participants (N = 21) were told that their AFAT scores were discrepant from their values (high core values of kindness and equality and high stigma), social consensus participants (N = 22) were told their scores were discrepant from their peers' scores (stigma much higher than their peers), and control participants (N = 21) were told their scores were consistent with both their peers' scores and their own values. Following the intervention, omnibus analyses revealed significant group differences on the AFAT Physical/Romantic Unattractiveness subscale (PRU; F (2, 59) = 4.43, P < 0.05). Planned contrasts revealed that cognitive dissonance group means were significantly lower than control means for AFAT total, AFAT PRU subscale, and AFAT social/character disparagement subscale (all P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between social consensus and controls. Results from this study suggest that cognitive dissonance interventions may be a successful way to reduce obesity stigma, particularly by changing attitudes about the appearance and attractiveness of obese individuals.",0
"The purpose of the study was to develop and evaluate Taking CHARGE, a self-management intervention designed to facilitate successful transitions to survivorship after breast cancer treatment. The Taking CHARGE intervention involves a two-pronged approach building on self-regulation principles to (1) equip women with self-management skills to address concerns following breast cancer treatment, and (2) provide information about common survivorship topics. The program involved four intervention contacts, two small group meetings and two individualized telephone sessions, delivered by nurse/health educators. This paper focuses on the process evaluation findings from a preliminary test of the Taking CHARGE intervention conducted with 25 women, aged 34-66 years, completing breast cancer treatment, who were randomly assigned to the intervention group. The process evaluation was conducted to obtain systematic information about the relevance and usefulness of the self-regulation approach, informational aspects, and program delivery. The findings indicated that intervention group participants found the Taking CHARGE program to be timely, relevant, and to have high utility in dealing with concerns that exist following breast cancer treatment. The process evaluation findings provide early evidence of the usefulness of the Taking CHARGE intervention for successful transition to survivorship following breast cancer treatment.",1
"Cognitive therapy (CT) is a specific and highly effective treatment for panic disorder (PD). Treatment normally involves 12-15 1-hr sessions. In an attempt to produce a more cost-effective version, a briefer treatment that made extensive use of between-sessions patient self-study modules was created. Forty-three PD patients were randomly allocated to full CT (FCT), brief CT (BCT), or a 3-month wait list. FCT and BCT were superior to wait list on all measures, and the gains obtained in treatment were maintained at 12-month follow-up. There were no significant differences between FCT and BCT. Both treatments had large (approximately 3.0) and essentially identical effect sizes. BCT required 6.5 hr of therapist time, including booster sessions. Patients' initial expectation of therapy success was negatively correlated with posttreatment panic-anxiety. Cognitive measures at the end of treatment predicted panic-anxiety at 12-month follow-up.",0
"We examined in a primary care sample whether acute-phase cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) would be more effective than usual care for patients with multiple prior episodes of depression. Depression outcome was based on a 3-monthly administered Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) during a 2-year follow-up. We confirmed that in patients with four or more prior episodes, CBT outperformed usual care by four points on the BDI, but not in patients with three or fewer prior episodes. Subsequent analyses suggested that CBT may be able to tackle cognitive problems related to rumination in patients with recurrent depression.",0
"The aim of this article was to evaluate the effectiveness of an information provision web-based early intervention via a randomized controlled trial for children and their parents following pediatric unintentional injury. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 29) or a control group (n = 27) following baseline measurements. Further assessment was taken at 4-6 weeks and 6 months post-trauma event. Analyses revealed that children within the intervention group reported improved anxiety, in comparison to a worsening of symptoms for children in the control group. Furthermore, children who had higher baseline trauma scores reported the intervention to be helpful. The intervention showed promising results in its ability to aid child recovery.",1
"Child maltreatment constitutes significant risk for adolescent delinquency. Although an ecological model has been proposed to explain this relationship, most studies focus on individual risk factors. Prospective data from 1,788 students attending 23 schools were used to examine the additive influence of childhood maltreatment, individual-level risk factors, and school-level variables assessed at the beginning of Grade 9 on delinquency 4 to 6 months later. Individual-level results indicated that being male, experiencing childhood maltreatment, and poor parental nurturing were predictors of violent delinquency. School climate also played a significant role: Given the same individual risk profile, a student attending a school that was perceived by students as safe was less likely to engage in violent delinquency than was a student attending a school perceived to be unsafe. Moreover, the impact of childhood maltreatment on risk for engaging in violent delinquency was somewhat mitigated by schools' participation in a comprehensive violence prevention program.",1
"The effectiveness of cue exposure following a priming dose was compared with cognitive-behavioral intervention in a community sample of problem drinkers. Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of the 2 conditions and received a mean of 5.84 (SD = 2.69) sessions. A psychologist blind to treatment condition conducted an 8-month follow-up. Compared with pretreatment levels, significant decreases in alcohol consumption were evident posttreatment and maintained at follow-up for both groups. Reductions in severity of dependence, impaired control, and alcohol-related problems were also evident for both groups at follow-up. No differences in outcome associated with initial severity of alcohol dependence were apparent. The results raise the issue of the appropriateness of reserving a goal of controlled drinking for those with relatively mild alcohol problems and low alcohol dependence.",0
"The purpose of this comparative outcome study was to investigate whether the effects of exposure in vivo treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia could be enhanced by adding interventions specifically for panic attacks before the start of exposure treatment. The additional effect of two types of treatment for panic attacks--pharmacological (fluvoxamine) and psychological (repeated hyperventilation provocations and respiratory training)--was examined. Thus, the combined treatment of panic interventions with exposure in vivo could be compared to exposure in vivo alone. Ninety-six patients were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions: double-blind, placebo-controlled fluvoxamine followed by exposure in vivo, psychological panic management followed by exposure, and exposure in vivo alone. Outcome was assessed by self-report measures, a standardized multitask behavioral avoidance test, and continuous monitoring of panic attacks. Seventy-six patients completed the study. All four treatments were effective and resulted in a significant decrease of agoraphobic avoidance. Moreover, the combination of fluvoxamine and exposure in vivo demonstrated efficacy superior to that of the other treatments and had twice as large an effect size (difference between pre- and posttreatment scores) on self-reported agoraphobic avoidance. The other treatments did not differ among each other in effectiveness. Results of the study indicate that the short-term outcome of exposure in vivo treatment can be enhanced by adding fluvoxamine treatment. Psychological panic management combined with exposure was not superior to exposure alone of equal duration.",0
"Although studies on sub-threshold depression in childhood and adolescence have demonstrated an at risk profile that merits further attention, only few investigators examined the impact of therapy with these children. In this study, twenty elementary schoolchildren (aged 10-12) with moderate depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to an eighteen-session cognitive-behavioural treatment programme or to a waiting list (WL) control group (= Study 1). The key components of the programme ""Taking Action"" used in the study were: affective education, problem-solving, cognitive restructuring and engaging in enjoyable activities. Child self-reports and parent reports were used to evaluate the outcome. Paired t-tests comparing the 4-months follow-up results with baseline measurements, revealed a significant improvement on the Children Depression Inventory and on the Self-Perception Profile for Children, but only in the treatment group. Afterwards, the WL control group was treated as well. All children were followed in a long-term follow-up study (= Study 2). Analyses at the 12 month stage of the follow-up study showed a further improvement of the scores on the Self-Perception Profile. Moreover, a significant decrease was found on the Children Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Child Behaviour Checklist parent measure. It was concluded that the protocol is suitable for European children. The most remarkable findings in this pilot study are discussed.",1
"Grief interventions are more effective for high risk individuals. The presence of suicide ideation following suicide bereavement was examined to determine whether it indicates a high risk status. Using data from a randomized controlled trial (n = 122) on the effectiveness of cognitive-behavior therapy, the effect of suicide ideation on the effectiveness of grief therapy on the bereavement outcome at 13 months post loss was examined. Results show that suicide ideators more often have a history of mental disorder and suicidal behavior than non-ideators, and suicide ideation indicates a high risk for adverse bereavement outcome. Grief therapy likely reduces the risk of maladaptive grief reactions among suicide ideators. Therefore, suicide ideators may benefit from grief therapy following a loss through suicide.",1
"The objective of this pilot study was to address the influence of an aerobic exercise program combined with relaxation on pain and psychological variables in migraine patients. Controlled, randomised design with half of the group receiving an intervention (aerobic exercise group) in addition to standard medical care received by all patients. SETTING/PATIENTS/OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Thirty female migraine outpatients completed a range of psychological questionnaires measuring sensational and affective dimensions of pain, body image, depression, and quality of life. The aerobic exercise group (n = 15) participated in a 6-week, twice-weekly, indoor exercise program (45 minutes of gymnastics with music and 15 minutes of progressive muscle relaxation). The program led to a significant reduction of self-rated migraine pain intensity. Although there was an improvement in depression-related symptoms within the aerobic exercise group, no significant differences in psychological variables between groups were found.",0
"Even low levels of residual symptoms are known to increase the risk of relapse and early recurrence of major depression. It is not known if ongoing psychotherapy lessens this risk. We therefore examined the impact of persistent symptoms, including mood, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms, on time to recurrence in women receiving maintenance interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-M) for recurrent depression. We analyzed data on 131 women aged 20-60 from a 2-year randomized trial of weekly versus twice-monthly versus monthly IPT-M. Participants achieved remission with IPT alone (n=99) or IPT plus sequential antidepressant medication (n=32). Medications were tapered before starting maintenance treatment. Residual symptoms were assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD; total score and subscales); insomnia was also assessed in 76 women with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data analyses used Cox proportional hazards regression models. Neither overall burden of residual symptoms (HRSD total score), nor HRSD mood and anxiety subscale scores predicted recurrence during ongoing IPT-M. In contrast, persistent insomnia measured both by the HRSD-17 insomnia subscale and the PSQI predicted recurrence. Women with persistent insomnia who required sequential pharamacotherapy had the highest recurrence rate (65%) compared to women requiring sequential treatment without insomnia (13%), or women who had recovered with IPT alone but had persistent insomnia (21%) or no insomnia (18%). Persistent insomnia following the recovery from an episode of recurrent major depression is associated with increased risk of recurrence despite maintenance psychotherapy, particularly for those withdrawn from antidepressant medication.",0
"To examine changes in total, flexible and rigid restraint, hunger, and disinhibition in obese individuals with Binge-Eating Disorder (BED), and assess whether these variables are associated with binge abstinence at post-treatment and during two-year follow-up. A total of 116 obese individuals with BED were randomized to a 20-week treatment trial plus two-year follow-up. Using the Eating Inventory (EI), we assessed these factors at pretreatment, post-treatment, and follow-up time-points and examined their relationship to binge abstinence at post-treatment, 12- and 24-month follow-up. Low disinhibition and high-total restraint are associated with post-treatment binge abstinence. There are no significant relationships between post-treatment EI variables and binge abstinence at 12- and 24-month follow-up. Reducing disinhibition as well as increasing EI dietary restraint during BED treatment may be important for short-term success.",0
"Studies of antidepressants and psychological treatments in functional bowel disorders (FBD) are methodologically limited. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) against education (EDU) and desipramine (DES) against placebo (PLA) in female patients with moderate to severe FBD (irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain, painful constipation, and unspecified FBD). We also evaluated the amenability of clinically meaningful subgroups to these treatments. This randomized, comparator-controlled, multicenter trial enrolled 431 adults from the University of North Carolina and the University of Toronto with moderate to severe symptoms of FBD. Participants received psychological (CBT vs. EDU) or antidepressant (DES vs. PLA) treatment for 12 weeks. Clinical, physiologic, and psychosocial assessments were performed before and at the end of treatment. The intention-to-treat analysis showed CBT as significantly more effective than EDU (P = 0.0001; responder rate, 70% CBT vs. 37% EDU; number needed to treat [NNT ], 3.1). DES did not show significant benefit over PLA in the intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.16; responder rate, 60% DES vs. 47% PLA; NNT, 8.1) but did show a statistically significant benefit in the per-protocol analysis (P = 0.01; responder rate, 73% DES vs. 49% PLA; NNT, 5.2), especially when participants with nondetectable blood levels of DES were excluded (P = 0.002). Improvement was best gauged by satisfaction with treatment. Subgroup analyses showed that DES was beneficial over PLA for moderate more than severe symptoms, abuse history, no depression, and diarrhea-predominant symptoms; CBT was beneficial over EDU for all subgroups except for depression. For female patients with moderate to severe FBD, CBT is effective and DES may be effective when taken adequately. Certain clinical subgroups are more or less amenable to these treatments.",0
"Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV offer life-extending benefit; however, the side effects associated with ART use negatively impact quality of life and medication adherence among people living with HIV. This study tested the efficacy of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for reducing ART symptoms and bother/distress related to ART side effects. Secondary aims were to test the impact of MBSR on medication adherence and psychological functioning. Seventy-six people living with HIV who were actively taking ART and reported distress from ART-related side effects were randomly assigned to an MBSR program or a wait-list control (WLC) standard care condition. We measured side effects, ART adherence, perceived stress, depression, positive and negative affect, and mindfulness at three time points: baseline, three-month follow-up, and six-month follow-up. Side effects and related distress were assessed separately from other symptoms. Compared with a WLC, participants in the MBSR condition experienced a reduction in the frequency of symptoms attributable to ARTs at three months post-intervention (mean difference=0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.01, 0.66; t(132)=2.04, P=0.044) and six months post-intervention (mean difference=0.38; 95% CI=0.05, 0.71; t(132)=2.27, P=0.025). MBSR participants also experienced a reduction in distress associated with those symptoms at three months post-intervention (mean difference=0.47; 95% CI=0.003, 0.94; t(132)=1.99, P=0.048) compared with the WLC condition. MBSR is a promising approach for reducing HIV treatment-related side effects.",1
"Previous studies suggest that individual preferences for medication- or psychotherapy-based treatments for depression may affect outcomes in clinical trials that compare these two forms of treatment. We assessed patients' beliefs about the causes of their depression, their preferred treatment, and strength of that preference in 80 patients participating in a 12-week clinical trial evaluating neuroimaging predictors of response to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or escitalopram. Forty-five patients expressed a preference for one of the 2 treatments, but being matched to preference did not influence remission or completion rates. Medication-preferring patients were more likely to terminate the trial early, regardless of treatment received. CBT-preferring patients rarely endorsed unknown causes for their depression, and medication-preferring patients were highly unlikely to identify pessimistic attitudes as a source of their depression. Among patients willing to be randomized to treatment, preference does not appear to strongly influence outcome. Specific preferences for CBT or medication may reflect differing conceptualizations about depressive illness, knowledge of which may enhance treatment retention and efficacy.",0
"We evaluated the effectiveness of biofeedback treatment on gait function in children with cerebral palsy. Thirty-six children with spastic cerebral palsy and dynamic equinus deformity were included in the study. The biofeedback group consisted of 21 children who each received EMG biofeedback training plus conventional exercise programme. The control group consisted of 15 children who each received conventional exercise programme only. Active range of motion of the ankle joints, muscle tone of plantar flexors, and gait function of the children were evaluated and compared. The biofeedback group displayed statistically significant improvements regarding tonus of plantar flexor muscles and active ROM of ankle joints (p < 0.000 for all parameters). Gait function showed statistically significant progress in both of the groups, but the biofeedback group was superior to controls. Children with cerebral palsy and dynamic equinus deformities may benefit from biofeedback treatment for ambulation.",1
"While attention bias modification (ABM) is a promising novel treatment for anxiety disorders, clinical trial data remain restricted to adults. The authors examined whether ABM induces greater reductions in pediatric anxiety symptoms and symptom severity than multiple control training interventions. From a target sample of 186 treatment-seeking children at a hospital-based child anxiety clinic, 40 patients with an ongoing anxiety disorder who met all inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: ABM designed to shift attention away from threat; placebo attention training using stimuli identical to those in the ABM condition; and placebo attention training using only neutral stimuli. All participants completed four weekly 480-trial sessions (1,920 total trials). Before and after the attention training sessions, children's clinical status was determined via semistructured interviews and questionnaires. Reduction in the number of anxiety symptoms and their severity was compared across the three groups. Change in the number of anxiety symptoms and their severity differed across the three conditions. This reflected significant reductions in the number of anxiety symptoms and symptom severity in the ABM condition but not in the placebo attention training or placebo-neutral condition. ABM, compared with two control conditions, reduces pediatric anxiety symptoms and severity. Further study of efficacy and underlying mechanisms is warranted.",0
"Patients attending for endoscopy are generally anxious and worried. To examine whether music reduced anxiety levels in patients attending for endoscopic procedures. Prospective randomized controlled trial of 180 patients (M:F 81:99). The effect of age (< or = or >51 years) and procedure (gastroscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy) on anxiety levels (state-trait anxiety inventory) on arrival in the unit and immediately before the endoscopy procedure, after listening to music or no music (control group) for the same period. At baseline, anxiety levels were not influenced by age (< or =51 years, n = 56:42.21 +/- 9.18; >51 years, n = 124:39.99 +/- 10.13 (P = 0.15) or procedure: gastroscopy, n = 87:39.43 +/- 9.9, flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy: n = 93:41.86 +/- 9.75 (P = 0.98). No difference was found in anxiety scores in the control group (n = 88) at baseline and immediately pre-endoscopy (P = 0.243), but music led to a significant reduction in anxiety scores (n = 92), which was maintained for all age groups irrespective of procedure (all P < 0.0001). Anxiety levels in patients attending for endoscopy were not influenced by age or procedure, but were significantly reduced by listening to music compared to controls. The availability of music within the endoscopy unit is a simple strategy that will improve the well-being of patients.",1
"A prospective randomized trial was conducted to examine the effectiveness, feasibility, and degree of implementation of home health care quality improvement interventions when implemented under usual conditions by usual care providers. A total of 311 older adults were randomized to enhanced usual care (EUC) that included routine depression screening and staff training in depression care management for older adults or to the intervention group (INT) that included antidepressants and/or psychotherapy treatment plus EUC. Implementing a routine screening protocol using the PHQ-9 and depression care management quality improvements is feasible in diverse home health care organizations and results in consistently better (but not statistically significant) depression outcomes in the INT group.",1
"The choice to be physically active or sedentary depends in part on the value of the alternatives that are available. The shift from sedentary to active alternatives may be a function of the value of the sedentary alternatives. To evaluate the influence of the value of the sedentary alternatives on the choice to be physically active or sedentary, 30 nonobese 8-12-year-old youth were randomized in groups that provided a choice between 4 active alternatives or 4 sedentary alternatives (Group 1), their least valued sedentary activity (Group 2), or their most valued sedentary activity (Group 3), on computerized and questionnaire versions of a behavioral choice task. The computer task required participants to work for access to the alternatives. The work required to obtain access to the active alternatives remained constant for all choices, while the work required to gain access to the sedentary alternatives progressively increased. Compared to Groups 1 and 3, participants in Group 2 chose to be sedentary less often as they had to make a choice between being physically active or sedentary on the computerized (p < .005) and the questionnaire version (p < .05) of the behavioral choice task, which correlated r = .54, p < .01. These results suggest interventions designed to increase physical activity by reducing access to sedentary behaviors may need to consider the value of the targeted sedentary behavior and the extent to which the sedentary behaviors compete with physical activity.",1
"This study came to compare the results of biofeedback retraining biofeedback (BFB), botulinum toxin botulinum type A (BTX-A) injection and partial division of puborectalis (PDPR) in the treatment of anismus patients. Consecutive patients treated for anismus fulfilled Rome II criteria for functional constipation at our institution were evaluated for inclusion. Participants were randomly allocated to receive BFB, BTX-A injection, and PDPR. All patients underwent anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion test, defecography, and electromyography activity of the anal sphincter. Follow up was conducted weekly in the first month then monthly for about 1 year. Study variables included clinical improvement, patient satisfaction, and objective improvement. Sixty patients with anismus were randomized and completed the study. The groups differed significantly regarding clinical improvement at 1 month (50% for BFB, 75%BTX-A injection, and 95% for PDPR, P = 0.006) and differences persisted at 1 year (30% for BFB, 35%BTX-A injection, and 70% for PDPR, P = 0.02). Constipation score of the patients significantly improved postPDPR and BTX-A injection. Manometric relaxation was achieved significantly in the three groups. Biofeedback retraining has a limited therapeutic effect, BTX-A injection seems to be successful for temporary treatment but PDPR is found to be an effective with lower morbidity in contrast to its higher success rate in treating anismus.",0
"Eighty-four depressed pregnant women were recruited during the second trimester of pregnancy and randomly assigned to a massage therapy group, a progressive muscle relaxation group or a control group that received standard prenatal care alone. These groups were compared to each other and to a non-depressed group at the end of pregnancy. The massage therapy group participants received two 20 min therapy sessions by their significant others each week for 16 weeks of pregnancy, starting during the second trimester. The relaxation group provided themselves with progressive muscle relaxation sessions on the same time schedule. Immediately after the massage therapy sessions on the first and last days of the 16-week period the women reported lower levels of anxiety and depressed mood and less leg and back pain. By the end of the study the massage group had higher dopamine and serotonin levels and lower levels of cortisol and norepinephrine. These changes may have contributed to the reduced fetal activity and the better neonatal outcome for the massage group (i.e. lesser incidence of prematurity and low birthweight), as well as their better performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment. The data suggest that depressed pregnant women and their offspring can benefit from massage therapy.",1
"Adolescents excluded from mainstream education have high mental health needs. The use of computerized Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (cCBT) has not been investigated with this group. To test the efficacy of the SPARX cCBT programme for symptoms of depression among adolescents in programmes for students excluded or alienated from mainstream education. Adolescents (32; 34% Maori, 38% Pacific Island, 56% male) aged 13-16 with Child Depression Rating Scale Revised (CDRS-R) scores indicating possible through to almost certain depressive disorder were randomized to SPARX to be completed over the following 5 weeks (n = 20) or to waitlist control (n = 12). Assessments were at baseline, 5 weeks and 10 weeks. Those in the wait condition were invited to complete SPARX after the 5 week assessment. Most participants (n = 26, 81%) completed at least 4 levels of SPARX and 22 (69%) completed all 7 levels. Among the 30 (94%) participants who began treatment as randomized and provided 5-week data, significant differences were found between cCBT and wait groups on the CDRS-R (baseline to 5-week mean change -14.7 versus -1.1, p<.001), remission (78% vs. 36%, p = .047) and on the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (-4.6 vs. +3.2 p = .05) but not on other self-rating psychological functioning scales. In intent-to-treat analyses CDRS-R changes and remission remained significant. Gains were maintained at 10-week follow-up. SPARX appears to be a promising treatment for students with symptoms of depression who are in alternative schooling programmes for those excluded from mainstream education.",0
"The efficacy of behavioural treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been well documented. However, severely depressed OCD patients showed fewer short- and long-term benefits than less depressed patients. The present study tested the hypothesis that reduction of depression by imipramine prior to behaviour therapy would enhance the effects of behavioural therapy on depressed OC patients. Thirty-eight patients were divided into highly and mildly depressed groups according to their scores on the Beck Depression Inventory; half of each group received imipramine and half received placebo for six weeks. All patients then received three weeks of daily behavioural treatment (exposure and response prevention) followed by 12 weekly sessions of supportive psychotherapy. Results indicated that although imipramine improved depressive symptoms in depressed patients, it did not affect OC symptoms. Behaviour therapy markedly reduced OC symptoms but, contrary to our hypothesis, imipramine did not potentiate the effects of behaviour therapy. No differences between highly depressed and mildly depressed patients on OC symptoms were found in their responses to behavioural or supportive therapy.",0
"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in youth involved in delinquency, but it is often not effectively treated. A randomized clinical trial was conducted comparing the outcomes of an emotion regulation therapy (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy, or TARGET) with a relational supportive therapy (Enhanced Treatment as Usual, or ETAU) with 59 delinquent girls (age 13-17 years) who met criteria for full or partial PTSD. Mixed model regression analyses demonstrated generally large effects for pre-post change in PTSD symptoms for both therapies but not in emotion regulation. Both therapies had small to medium effect size changes in anxiety, anger, depression, and posttraumatic cognitions. Treatment × Time interactions showed small to medium effects favoring TARGET for change in PTSD (intrusive reexperiencing and avoidance) and anxiety symptoms, posttraumatic cognitions, and emotion regulation, and favoring ETAU for change in hope and anger. Results provide preliminary support for TARGET as a potentially efficacious therapy for PTSD with delinquent girls. Relational therapies such as ETAU also may be beneficial for delinquent girls with PTSD, particularly to enhance optimism and self-efficacy and reduce anger.",1
"The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of saffron odor on symptoms unique to women, such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain) and irregular menstruation. Thirty-five women with a normal sense of smell were exposed to saffron odor for 20 min. Saliva samples were then collected to measure levels of cortisol (C), testosterone (T) and 17-β estradiol (E) by enzyme immunoassay, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was administered as a psychological test. Saffron odor significantly decreased C levels after short-term stimulation (20 min) in both follicular and luteal phases. E level after exposure to saffron odor was increased in both the follicular- and luteal-phase groups. STAI score decreased in the follicular and luteal phases in the saffron group. The present findings support the existence of physiological and psychological effects of saffron odor in women. Our results indicate that saffron odor exert some effects in the treatment of PMS, dysmenorrhea and irregular menstruation. This is the first report to suggest that saffron odor may be effective in treating menstrual distress.",1
"Yoga and relaxation techniques have traditionally been used by nonmedical practitioners to help alleviate musculoskeletal symptoms. The objective of this study was to collect controlled observations of the effect of yoga on the hands of patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Patients with OA of the hands were randomly assigned to receive either the yoga program or no therapy. Yoga techniques were supervised by one instructor once/week for 8 weeks. Variables assessed were pain, strength, motion, joint circumference, tenderness, and hand function using the Stanford Hand Assessment questionnaire. The yoga treated group improved significantly more than the control group in pain during activity, tenderness and finger range of motion. Other trends also favored the yoga program. This yoga derived program was effective in providing relief in hand OA. Further studies are needed to compare this with other treatments and to examine longterm effects.",1
"The present study investigates the effectiveness of Erikson hypnosis and Jacobson relaxation for the reduction of osteoarthritis pain. Participants reporting pain from hip or knee osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: (a) hypnosis (i.e. standardized eight-session hypnosis treatment); (b) relaxation (i.e. standardized eight sessions of Jacobson's relaxation treatment); (c) control (i.e. waiting list). Overall, results show that the two experimental groups had a lower level of subjective pain than the control group and that the level of subjective pain decreased with time. An interaction effect between group treatment and time measurement was also observed in which beneficial effects of treatment appeared more rapidly for the hypnosis group. Results also show that hypnosis and relaxation are effective in reducing the amount of analgesic medication taken by participants. Finally, the present results suggest that individual differences in imagery moderate the effect of the psychological treatment at the 6 month follow-up but not at previous times of measurement (i.e. after 4 weeks of treatment, after 8 weeks of treatment and at the 3 month follow-up). The results are interpreted in terms of psychological processes underlying hypnosis, and their implications for the psychological treatment of pain are discussed.",0
"This study investigated the specific patient factors that predict responsiveness to a cognitive rehabilitation program. The program has previously been demonstrated to be successful at the group level in patients with gliomas, but it is unclear which patient characteristics optimized the effect of the intervention at the individual level. Four categories of possible predictors of improvement were selected for evaluation: sociodemographic and clinical variables, self-reported cognitive symptoms, and objective neuropsychological test performance. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted, beginning with the most accessible (sociodemographic) variables and ending with the most difficult (baseline neuropsychological) to identify in clinical practice. Nearly 60% of the participants of the intervention were classified as reliably improved. Reliable improvement was predicted by age (p = .003) and education (p = .011). Additional results suggested that younger patients were more likely to benefit specifically from the cognitive rehabilitation program (p = .001), and that higher education was also associated with improvement in the control group (p = .024). The findings are discussed in light of brain reserve theory. A practical implication is that cognitive rehabilitation programs should take the patients' age into account and, if possible, adapt programs to increase the likelihood of improvement among older participants.",1
"Optimal treatment to postpone functional decline in patients with dementia is not established. To test a nonpharmacologic intervention realigning environmental demands with patient capabilities. Prospective 2-group randomized trial (Care of Persons with Dementia in their Environments [COPE]) involving patients with dementia and family caregivers (community-living dyads) recruited from March 2006 through June 2008 in Pennsylvania. Up to 12 home or telephone contacts over 4 months by health professionals who assessed patient capabilities and deficits; obtained blood and urine samples; and trained families in home safety, simplifying tasks, and stress reduction. Control group caregivers received 3 telephone calls and educational materials. Functional dependence, quality of life, frequency of agitated behaviors, and engagement for patients and well-being, confidence using activities, and perceived benefits for caregivers at 4 months. Of 284 dyads screened, 270 (95%) were eligible and 237 (88%) randomized. Data were collected from 209 dyads (88%) at 4 months and 173 (73%) at 9 months. At 4 months, compared with controls, COPE patients had less functional dependence (adjusted mean difference, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.03-0.44; P = .02; Cohen d = 0.21) and less dependence in instrumental activities of daily living (adjusted mean difference, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.09-0.55; P = .007; Cohen d = 0.43), measured by a 15-item scale modeled after the Functional Independence Measure; COPE patients also had improved engagement (adjusted mean difference, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07-0.22; P = .03; Cohen d = 0.26), measured by a 5-item scale. COPE caregivers improved in their well-being (adjusted mean difference in Perceived Change Index, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.36; P = .002; Cohen d = 0.30) and confidence using activities (adjusted mean difference, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.30-1.32; P = .002; Cohen d = 0.54), measured by a 5-item scale. By 4 months, 64 COPE dyads (62.7%) vs 48 control group dyads (44.9%) eliminated 1 or more caregiver-identified problems (chi(2/1) = 6.72, P = . 01). Among community-living dyads, a nonpharmacologic biobehavioral environmental intervention compared with control resulted in better outcomes for COPE dyads at 4 months. Although no group differences were observed at 9 months for patients, COPE caregivers perceived greater benefits. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00259454.",0
"The goal was to identify correlates of patient satisfaction with drug and behavioral treatments for urge-predominant incontinence, which may help tailor treatments to improve satisfaction. Planned secondary analysis of a multi-center, clinical trial randomizing 307 women to 10 weeks of tolterodine alone or combined with behavioral training. Satisfaction was measured using the Patient Satisfaction Question (PSQ). Potential correlates included baseline demographics, incontinence characteristics and prior treatments, history and physical parameters, expectations of treatment success, and outcome variables including the Global Perception of Improvement (GPI) and Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI). After multivariable analysis, every 10-point increase in UDI change score increased odds of satisfaction by 11% (OR 1.11; 1.04-1.19). Odds of satisfaction increased among women reporting ""much better"" on the GPI (OR 13.8; 4.94-38.60). Treatment satisfaction for women with urge-predominant incontinence was associated with patient-related outcomes reflecting impression of improvement and bother from incontinence-related symptoms.",1
"Patients' initial beliefs about the success of a given pain treatment are shown to have an important influence on the final treatment outcome. The aims of the paper are to assess determinants of patients' treatment expectancy and to examine the extent to which treatment expectancy predicts the short-term and long-term outcome of cognitive-behavioral treatment of chronic pain. This study employs the data of 2 pooled randomized clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral interventions for 171 patients with fibromyalgia and chronic low back pain. Pretreatment and posttreatment expectancy were measured by a short questionnaire, which was based on the procedure by Borkovec and Nau. Four composite outcome variables (pain coping and control, motoric behavior, negative affect, and quality of life) were measured before and after the intervention and at 12 months follow-up. Furthermore, several patient characteristics were taken into account. Patients with higher treatment expectancies significantly received less disability compensation and were less fearful. A regression model of 3 factors (better pain coping and control, active and positive interpretation of pain, and less disability compensation) significantly explained 10% of the variance in pretreatment expectancy. Pretreatment expectancy significantly predicted each of the 4 outcome measures immediately after treatment and at 12 months follow-up. This study corroborates the importance of treatment expectation before entering a cognitive-behavioral intervention in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.",1
"In humans, oxytocin nasal administration reduces social-threat perception and improves processes involved in communication and the encoding of positive social cues. The aim of this study was to determine whether oxytocin given as an adjunct to exposure therapy improves treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD) as indicated by a comprehensive set of symptom outcome measures. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we administered 24 IU of oxytocin or a placebo in combination with exposure therapy to twenty-five participants who met primary diagnosis for SAD. Participants administered with oxytocin showed improved positive evaluations of appearance and speech performance as exposure treatment sessions progressed. These effects did not generalize to improve overall treatment outcome from exposure therapy. Participants who received oxytocin or placebo reported similar levels of symptom reduction following treatment across symptom severity, dysfunctional cognition, and life-impairment measures. This study shows that the administration of oxytocin improves mental representations of self, following exposure therapy. These effects may be either short term or situation specific. Future research is now needed to determine whether oxytocin can enhance treatment outcomes for SAD when used with greater frequency, with a wider variety of social learning experiences, and in conjunction with interventions that more specifically target change in broader dysfunctional cognitions.",0
"One hundred ten patients addicted to nicotine were subjected to either sudden or gradual withdrawal in the course of a smoking cessation programme. Eighty-two patients emerged from the treatment as non-smokers. In a follow-up after 1 year 70% of these successful clients replied to an anonymous questionnaire. Concerning the relapse rate, no significant difference could be found between the two treatment groups, but patients who underwent slow withdrawal smoked significantly less when comparing their current consumption with that before the start of the therapy. Patients who underwent sudden stopping reached their original level of nicotine use again.",0
"It is known that a small number of patients with mental health problems have chronic disorders and account for a disproportionate amount of mental health costs. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the cost-effectiveness of psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy vs treatment as usual in patients with mental health problems who were unresponsive to usual treatment. Subjects (N = 110) with nonpsychotic disorders unresponsive to 6 months of routine specialist mental health treatment were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Sixty-three percent were women, the mean age was 41.4 years, the median duration of illness was 5 years, 68% were unemployed or receiving state benefits because of illness, and 75.5% had a depressive illness. Intervention patients received 8 weekly sessions of psychodynamic-interpersonal psychotherapy. Control patients received usual care from their psychiatrist. Outcome measures included ratings of psychological distress and health status and a detailed economic evaluation. Analysis was conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. Subjects randomized to psychotherapy had a significantly greater improvement than controls in psychological distress and social functioning 6 months after the trial. Baseline treatment costs were similar for both groups. Subjects who received psychotherapy showed significant reductions in the cost of health care utilization in the 6 months after treatment compared with controls. The extra cost of psychotherapy was recouped within 6 months through reductions in health care use. These preliminary findings suggest that brief psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy may be cost-effective relative to usual care for patients with enduring nonpsychotic symptoms who are not helped by conventional psychiatric treatment.",1
"The basal ganglia may be selectively activated during rhythmic, metered movement such as tango dancing, which may improve motor control in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Other partner dances may be more suitable and preferable for those with Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of tango, waltz/foxtrot and no intervention on functional motor control in individuals with Parkinson's disease. This study employed a randomized, between- notsubject, prospective, repeated measures design. Fifty-eight people with mild-moderate Parkinson's disease participated. Participants were randomly assigned to tango, waltz/foxtrot or no intervention (control) groups. Those in the dance groups attended 1-h classes twice a week, completing 20 lessons in 13 weeks. Balance, functional mobility, forward and backward walking were evaluated before and after the intervention. Both dance groups improved more than the control group, which did not improve. The tango and waltz/foxtrot groups improved significantly on the Berg Balance Scale, 6-minute walk distance, and backward stride length. The tango group improved as much or more than those in the waltz/foxtrot group on several measures. Tango may target deficits associated with Parkinson's disease more than waltz/foxtrot, but both dances may benefit balance and locomotion.",1
"The cognitive-behavioral theory of health anxiety predicts atypical responses in health anxious individuals when exposed to health related information. Systematic research is still needed to support the theory. This investigation examined 192 participants varying a subclinical levels of health anxiety, who were randomly given feedback on an ostensible diagnostic measure, indicating positive, negative or ambiguous risk for health complications. Responses to a cold pressor task were then measured. The results indicated that regardless of the type of feedback patients were given, health anxious individuals displayed the predicted cognitive (e.g. negatively interpreted information) and behavioral responses (e.g. increased reassurance seeking). Important and perhaps central cognitions to health anxiety were identified. Health anxious individuals regarded themselves to be at greater risk for disease overall, and attached greater accuracy to health related information. Extending the cognitive-behavioural theory, health anxiety was found to be associated with decreased usage of positive somatic monitoring of symptoms, suggesting health anxiety may be associated with a failure to engage in protective strategies. Health anxiety did not result in cognitive or behavioural avoidance of illness information. Clinical implications and future directions for research are described.",0
"The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of group-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for social anxiety in schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia (20) with comorbid social anxiety were randomly assigned to the group-based CBT or wait-list control condition. Pre-, post- and 6-week follow-up ratings included measures of social anxiety and avoidance, mood and quality of life. The intervention group improved on all outcome measures and the control group showed no change in symptomatology. Group-based CBT is effective in treating social anxiety in schizophrenia.",1
"Cognitive adaptation training (CAT) has been tested as a psychosocial treatment, showing promising results. To date there are no reported tests of CAT treatment outside the United States. Thus, we decided to adjust CAT treatment and apply it to an Integrated Treatment setting in Denmark. In this article we describe and discuss the feasibility of using CAT treatment in a randomized clinical trial in Denmark. The treatment period was shorter and the patients were instructed in prompting for specific actions by using newer tools such as schedules in their mobile phones. Social functioning, symptoms and quality of life were assessed using instruments validated in a Danish context. It was judged that, after some adjustments to fit the Danish assertive community treatment, CAT treatment was feasible in a Danish setting.",1
"To investigate the effectiveness of intensive sleep retraining in comparison and combination with traditional behavioral intervention for chronic primary insomnia. Seventy-nine volunteers with chronic sleep-onset insomnia (with or without sleep maintenance difficulties) were randomly assigned either to intensive sleep retraining (ISR), stimulus control therapy (SCT), ISR plus SCT, or the control (sleep hygiene) treatment condition. ISR treatment consisted of 50 sleep onset trials over a 25-h sleep deprivation period. Treatment response was assessed with sleep diary, activity monitoring, and questionnaire measures. The active treatment groups (ISR, SCT, ISR+SCT) all resulted in significant improvements in sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency, with moderate to large effect sizes from pre- to post-treatment. Wake time after sleep onset decreased significantly in the SCT and ISR+SCT groups. Total sleep time increased significantly in the ISR and ISR+SCT treatment groups. Participants receiving ISR (ISR, ISR+SCT) experienced rapidly improved SOL and TST during treatment, suggesting an advantage of rapid improvements in sleep in response to ISR. Although there were few statistically significant differences between groups on individual variables, ISR+SCT resulted in consistently larger effect sizes of change than other treatments, including questionnaire measures of sleep quality, sleep self-efficacy, and daytime functioning. The combination treatment group (ISR+SCT) showed trends to outperform other active treatment groups with fewer treatment dropouts, and a greater proportion of treatment responders with 61% reaching ""good sleeper"" status. Treatment gains achieved at post-treatment in the active treatment groups were largely maintained throughout follow-up periods to 6 months. This 25-hour intensive conditioning treatment for chronic insomnia can produce rapid improvements in sleep, daytime functioning, and psychological variables. Adding ISR to traditional interventions seems to result in a superior treatment response.",1
"Patients scheduled for gastrointestinal procedures such as colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenoscopy are often anxious and frightened. High levels of anxiety may result in more difficult and painful procedures. Past research has reported education, coping skills, relaxation techniques, and combinations of these including music, have decreased anxiety in patients across many settings. Self-selected music therapy for preprocedural anxiety has not been studied. A randomized controlled trial of 198 patients was undertaken to determine whether 15 minutes of self-selected music reduced preprocedure anxiety. The State Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to measure patients' anxiety. One-hundred ninety-three men and 5 women comprised the sample with an average age of 61 (SD 10.5). Patients who listened to music (n = 100) reduced their anxiety score from 36.7 (SD 9.1) to 32.3 (SD 10.4), while those who did not listen to music (n = 98) reduced their anxiety score from 36.1 (SD 8.3) to 34.6 (SD 11.5). These differences were statistically significant (F = 7.5, p =.007) after controlling for trait anxiety. There were no significant vital sign changes premusic and postmusic. Music is a noninvasive nursing intervention that can significantly reduce patients' anxiety prior to gastrointestinal procedures. Further research should address using music to reduce anxiety in other procedure areas and testing effectiveness of self-selected versus investigator-selected music in reducing anxiety.",0
"This study evaluated a targeted intervention designed to alleviate body image and eating problems in adolescent girls that was delivered over the internet so as to increase access to the program. The program consisted of six, 90-minute weekly small group, synchronous on-line sessions and was facilitated by a therapist and manual. Participants were 73 girls (mean age=14.4 years, SD=1.48) who self-identified as having body image or eating problems and were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=36) (assessed at baseline, post-intervention and at 2- and 6-months follow-up) or a delayed treatment control group (n=37) (assessed at baseline and 6-7 weeks later). Clinically significant improvements in body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, and depression were observed at post-intervention and maintained at follow-up. Internet delivery was enthusiastically endorsed. The program offers a promising approach to improve body image and eating problems that also addresses geographic access problems.",1
"The present study assessed the effects of a Motivational Interviewing (MI) based counselling training for nurses on clinical, behavioural and process outcomes among diabetes type 2 patients. The study is an RCT with follow-up measurements after 12 and 24 months. Thirty-three nurses and 584 patients participated. Nurses in the experimental condition received the training; control group nurses were trained after the study. The training consisted of two training sessions, two follow-up meetings, written feedback and three direct feedback sessions. Basic MI-principles and techniques and an MI-based counselling protocol were addressed. Results indicated disadvantageous effects on fat intake and HDL and advantageous effects on chance locus of control and knowledge. No effects were found on vegetable or fruit intake, physical activity, HbA1c, weight, blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, health care climate, quality of life or on self-efficacy. As in other MI studies, mixed results were found. It would be premature to recommend dissemination of MI in diabetes care. More studies are needed in real-world settings with health care professionals of the field instead of intensively trained MI interventionists. Knowledge should be gained about adequate training and factors contributing to the implementation of MI in daily practice.",0
"The goal of the present study was to compare 2 cognitive assessment methods for social anxiety: a thought listing and a self-report method. The focus of this study was on the convergent and divergent validity of these methods using a multi-trait multi-method approach. Furthermore, treatment sensitivity was explored. Fifty-eight patients with social phobia completed thought listings followed by 2 different social stress tasks before and after an exposure group treatment (n = 33), or following a waiting period (n = 25). One task consisted of speaking in front of 2 confederates while the other task involved initiating a conversation with an opposite-sex confederate. Two questionnaires measuring positive and negative self-statements regarding public speaking and social interactions were also completed. To compare the balance of positive and negative thoughts, the State of Mind ratio [positive thoughts/(positive+negative thoughts)] was calculated for both cognitive assessment methods. Results demonstrate that methods related to social interaction anxiety showed better convergent validity than methods related to public speaking anxiety; however, public speaking methods captured treatment effects better than methods related to social interaction anxiety. This study questions the common assumption that different cognitive assessment methods measure the same construct.",1
"To determine the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomised trial in Australia of the effectiveness of general practitioner-supported delivery of internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and enhanced psychological care. Cluster randomised trial involving patients attending general practices in Australia. Participating practices were randomly allocated to interventions. The study was conducted between January 2004 and January 2007. Enhanced GP care was delivered by doctors who had completed specific mental health training; the experimental condition consisted of enhanced GP care plus MoodGYM, an internet-based CBT intervention. Demographic and behavioural characteristics of patients, and demographic and practice characteristics of GPs; time to resolution of psychological symptoms for patients involved in the longitudinal phase of the trial. 1571 patients attending 90 GPs from 84 general practices were identified as potentially suitable for recruitment. These patients had a mean age of 35 years, 76% were female, 84% had access to the internet for personal use, and 22% reported high or very high levels of psychological distress on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. The 90 GPs had a mean age of 49 years, 53% were female and 25% had completed formal mental health training. Of the 1571 screened patients, 340 reported high levels of psychological distress, but only 140 of these could be further assessed for eligibility in the trial. Of these 140, 83 patients with depression (attending 10 GPs in eight general practices) proceeded to randomisation. For these patients, the experimental intervention (enhanced GP care plus MoodGYM) tended to result in prompt and more sustained resolution of depressive symptoms. Our capacity to conduct a definitive trial was limited by available resources. Preliminary data suggest that primary care patients with depression may derive additional benefits from an internet-based CBT program delivered in conjunction with enhanced psychological care from GPs.",0
"Autogenic training (AT) is a type of meditation usually used for reducing stress. This pilot study describes how AT was used on a group of early stage cancer patients and the observed effect on stress-related behaviours and immune system responses. This was a randomized trial with 31 early stage breast cancer women, having received a lumpectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy. The women were randomized into two groups. Group 1 received a home visit only. Group 2 received a home visit and 2 months' weekly Autogenic training. At the beginning and end of the 2 monthly periods, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and T and B cell markers were measured to give an indication of changes in immune system responses and measurement of anxiety and depression. At the end of the study, HADS scores and T and B cell markers remained similar in the women who did not receive AT. The women receiving AT showed a strong statistical difference for an improvement in their HADS scores and those women observed in a meditative state as opposed to a relaxed state were found to have an increase in their immune responses. This study suggests AT as a powerful self-help therapy.",1
"We tested two interventions for improving sleep consolidation and depth in normal elderly participants: a modification of sleep-restriction therapy and sleep-hygiene education. Twenty-one elderly participants without sleep disorders were randomized to sleep hygiene plus bed restriction (i.e., restricting time in bed by 30 minutes nightly for one year) or to sleep hygiene alone. Participants in the bed-restriction group showed a median increase in sleep efficiency of 6.1% versus 1.8% in participants receiving sleep hygiene instruction, and an increase in allnight delta EEG power. Self-reported mood on awakening in the morning showed greater improvement over the first eight weeks in the sleep-hygiene condition. The use of sleep hygiene was associated with initial improvement in daytime well-being, whereas bed restriction led to sustained improvements in sleep continuity and sleep depth.",1
"The present study investigated the phenomenon of sudden gains in 107 participants with social phobia (social anxiety disorder) who received either cognitive-behavioral group therapy or exposure group therapy without explicit cognitive interventions, which primarily used public speaking situations as exposure tasks. Twenty-two out of 967 session-to-session intervals met criteria for sudden gains, which most frequently occurred in Session 5. Individuals with sudden gains showed similar improvements in the 2 treatment groups. Although cognitive-behavioral therapy was associated with more cognitive changes than exposure therapy, cognitive changes did not precede sudden gains. In general, the results of this study question the clinical significance of sudden gains in social phobia treatment.",0
"We investigated the effects of psychiatric group intervention on the emotions, natural-killer (NK) cell activity and pregnancy rate in Japanese infertile women by a randomized study. Thirty-seven women completed a 5-session intervention program and were compared with 37 controls. Psychological discomfort and NK-cell activity (47.7% to 34.1%, P<.0001) significantly decreased after the intervention, whereas no significant changes were observed in controls. According to a 1-year follow-up of both groups, the pregnancy rate in the intervention group was significantly higher than that of controls (37.8% vs. 13.5%, P=.03). Psychological group intervention was therefore effective in Japanese infertile women.",1
"To design, implement, and examine the psychoneuroendocrine responses of three different types of stress management programs. Randomly assigned. A pre/post experimental design comparing variables between three different programs and a control group. The first program included training in deep breathing, relaxation response, meditation, and guided imagery techniques (RRGI). The second program included training in cognitive behavioral techniques (CB). The third program included both RRGI and CB (RRGICB). The study was conducted at Buenos Aires University. Participants (N  = 52) were undergraduate students. Anxiety, anger, hopelessness, neuroticism, respiration rate, and salivary cortisol levels were assessed. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to investigate differences in pre and post variables. Subjects in the RRGI group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety (p < .011), anger (p < .012), neuroticism (p < .01), respiratory rate (p < .002), hopelessness (p < .01), and salivary cortisol (p < .002) after the treatment. Subjects in the CB group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety (p < .018), anger (p < .037), and neuroticism (p < .03) after the treatment. Subjects in the RRGICB group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety (p < .001), anger (p < .001), neuroticism (p < .008), hopelessness (p < .01), respiratory rate (p < .001), and salivary cortisol (p < .002) after the treatment. Subjects in the control group showed only one variable modification, a significant increase in cortisol levels (p < .004). The combination of deep breathing, relaxation response, meditation, and guided imagery techniques with CB seems to be effective at helping people to deal with stress.",1
"Exposure to external phobic cues is an effective therapy for panic/agoraphobia but the value of exposure to interoceptive cues is unclear. Randomised controlled comparison in panic/agoraphobia of the effects of (a) external, (b) interceptive or (c) combined external and interoceptive self-exposure to (d) control subjects. Eighty out-patients were randomised to a control group or to one of three forms of self-exposure treatment (external, interoceptive, or combined). Each treatment included seven sessions over 10 weeks and daily self-exposure homework. Assessments were at pre- and post-treatment and up to 1 year post-entry. Assessors remained blind during treatment. The three self-exposure groups improved significantly and similarly at post-treatment and up to 1-year followup, and significantly more than did the control subjects. Rates of improvement on main outcome measures averaged 60% at post-treatment and 77% at follow-up. The three methods of self-exposure were equally effective in reducing panic and agoraphobic symptoms in the short- and long-term.",1
"The effect of perfectionism on acute treatment outcomes was explored in a randomized controlled trial of 439 clinically depressed adolescents (12-17 years of age) enrolled in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) who received cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), fluoxetine, a combination of CBT and FLX, or pill placebo. Measures included the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised, the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-Grades 7-9, and the perfectionism subscale from the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (DAS). Predictor results indicate that adolescents with higher versus lower DAS perfectionism scores at baseline, regardless of treatment, continued to demonstrate elevated depression scores across the acute treatment period. In the case of suicidality, DAS perfectionism impeded improvement. Treatment outcomes were partially mediated by the change in DAS perfectionism across the 12-week period.",1
"Cognitive behavioral therapy is treatment of choice for insomnia, but availability is scarce. Self-help can increase availability at low cost, but evidence for its efficacy is limited, especially for the typical insomnia patient with co-morbid problems. We hypothesized that a cognitive behaviorally based self-help book is effective to treat insomnia in individuals, also with co-morbid problems, and that the effect is enhanced by adding brief therapist telephone support. Volunteer sample; 133 media-recruited adults with insomnia. History of sleep difficulties (mean [SD]) 11.8 [12.0] years. 92.5% had co-morbid problems (e.g. allergy, pain, and depression). Parallel randomized (block-randomization, n ≥ 21) controlled ""open label"" trial; three groups-bibliotherapy with (n = 44) and without (n = 45) therapist support, and waiting list control (n = 44). Assessments before and after treatment, and at three-month follow-up. Intervention was six weeks of bibliotherapeutic self-help, with established cognitive behavioral methods including sleep restriction, stimulus control, and cognitive restructuring. Therapist support was a 15-minute structured telephone call scheduled weekly. Main outcome measures were sleep diary data, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Intention-to-treat analyses of 133 participants showed significant improvements in both self-help groups from pre to post treatment compared to waiting list. For example, treatment with and without support gave shorter sleep onset latency (improvement minutes [95% Confidence Interval], 35.4 [24.2 to 46.6], and 20.6 [10.6 to 30.6] respectively), and support gave a higher remission rate (defined as ISI score below 8; 61.4%), than bibliotherapy alone (24.4%, p's < .001). Improvements were not seen in the control group (sleep onset latency 4.6 minutes shorter [-1.5 to 10.7], and remission rate 2.3%). Self-help groups maintained gains at three-month follow-up. Participants receiving self-help for insomnia benefited markedly. Self-help, especially if therapist-supported, has considerable potential to be as effective as individual treatment at lower cost, also for individuals with co-morbid problems. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01105052.",1
"To observe the effect of yoga on menopausal symptoms using a prospective, randomized, controlled and interventional study. Main outcome measures Total Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) score and three subscale scores (somatovegetative, psychological and urogenital) were measured on day 1 and day 90 in the study group which performed yoga (asana, pranayam and meditation) under supervision for three months, and were compared with the control group that did not perform yoga. MRS has been designed to measure health-related quality of life of ageing women. It consists of 11 symptoms and three subscales. It was observed that on day 1 the scores in both the groups were comparable. On day 90, the scores in the yoga group showed a reduction in score on all the subscales, which was statistically significant. No significant difference was noted in the control group. Yoga is effective in reducing menopausal symptoms and should be considered as alternative therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms.",1
"We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test an integrated behavioral intervention designed to enhance using HIV treatment as prevention by improving medication adherence, reducing risks for other sexually transmitted infections, and minimizing risk compensation beliefs. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS (n = 436) participated in a randomized clinical trial testing an intensive behavioral intervention aimed at reducing HIV transmission risks compared with an attention control condition. We used unannounced pill counts to monitor antiretroviral therapy adherence and computerized interviews to measure risk behaviors. The integrated transmission risk reduction intervention demonstrated increased antiretroviral therapy adherence and less unprotected intercourse with nonseroconcordant partners at 3- and 6-month follow-ups as well as fewer new sexually transmitted infections diagnosed over the 9-month follow-up period (adjusted odds ratio = 3.0; P < .05; 95% confidence interval = 1.01, 9.04). The integrated intervention also reduced behavioral risk compensation beliefs. A theory-based integrated behavioral intervention can improve HIV treatment adherence and reduce HIV transmission risks. HIV treatment as prevention should be bundled with behavioral interventions to maximize effectiveness.",0
"The effects of video feedback and nonnegative feedback from other people were examined as possibly ameliorating distorted appraisals of bodily sensations, as well as subjective and physiological anxiety in socially anxious individuals. Nonnegative feedback from a confederate emphasized the absence of negative outcomes (e.g., did not seem to tremble) rather than the presence of positive outcomes (e.g., looked calm). Socially anxious students were randomly assigned to either the experimental group, which received video and social feedback (n=12), or the control group (n 13). Participants were asked to give a videotaped speech twice. After the first speech, the experimental group watched the videotape of their speech and received feedback from a confederate, whereas the control group watched the video of another person's speech. The intervention improved distorted appraisal of bodily sensations and anticipatory anxiety for the experimental group. However, there were no differential effects on anxiety between the groups during speeches.",0
"In prior research, Katz et al. found that role induction (RI) improved engagement for substance dependent clients relative to standard outpatient treatment orientation. The current study replicates and extends these findings to an examination of long-term outcomes. Substance dependent clients entering outpatient drug-free treatment (N = 353) were randomly assigned to RI or to Standard (ST) orientation followed by routine clinic treatment. Measures of employment, crime, and substance use were collected at intake and at six- and 12-months post-intake. Controlling for baseline differences in substance use, results partially replicated our earlier findings of better engagement for RI, as compared to ST participants; more RI than ST participants attended at least one post-orientation counselling session. RI improved 12-month substance use outcome relative to ST. The potential gain in retention and in reduced substance use at follow-up associated with a single RI session, recommend this strategy for further development and study.",1
"To study the impact of a weight-loss program on sex hormones and sexual function among 38 middle-aged obese men (BMI >or=35 kg/m(2)). A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted. The treatment group (n = 19) participated in a 4-month weight-loss program including 10 weeks on a very-low-energy diet (VLED) and 17 behavior modification visits. There was no intervention in the control group (n = 19). Both groups were followed for 8 months, i.e., 22 weeks after the active weight loss in the treatment group. The outcome measures (weight, sex hormones, sexual function, leptin, and metabolic variables) were obtained at baseline and at three time-points during follow-up. The mean weight loss in the treatment group was 21 kg at the end of the 10-week VLED. At the end of follow-up, the maintained weight loss was 17 kg of baseline weight. The control group was weight stable throughout the study. In the treatment group, increases in sex hormone-binding globulin, testosterone, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, as well as decreases in insulin and leptin, were maintained until the end of follow-up, although with VLED, the level of several hormones and metabolic variables improved transiently during the rapid weight loss. There were no significant changes in the questionnaire scores on sexual function in either group. We conclude that obese men lose weight and increase their serum testosterone level on a weight-loss program with VLED and behavior modification. However, they do not change their sexual function scores.",0
"Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) began as a male organization, but about one third is now female. Studies have found that women participate at least as much as men and benefit equally from AA, but it is unclear whether women benefit from AA in the same or different ways as men. This study tested whether gender moderated the mechanisms through which AA aids recovery. A cohort study of alcohol dependent adults (N=1726; 24% female; Project MATCH) was assessed on AA attendance during treatment; with mediators at 9 months; outcomes (Percent Days Abstinent [PDA] and Drinks per Drinking Day [DDD]) at 15 months. Multiple mediator models tested whether purported mechanisms (i.e., self-efficacy, depression, social networks, spirituality/religiosity) explained AA's effects differently for men and women controlling for baseline values, mediators, treatment, and other confounders. For PDA, the proportion of AA's effect accounted for by the mediators was similar for men (53%) and women (49%). Both men and women were found to benefit from changes in social factors but these mechanisms were more important among men. For DDD, the mediators accounted for 70% of the effect of AA for men and 41% for women. Again, men benefitted mostly from social changes. Independent of AA's effects, negative affect self-efficacy was shown to have a strong relationship to outcome for women but not men. The recovery benefits derived from AA differ in nature and magnitude between men and women and may reflect differing needs based on recovery challenges related to gender-based social roles and drinking contexts.",0
"The present study evaluated the efficacy of the Middle School Success intervention (MSS) for reducing substance use and delinquency among girls in foster care, using a randomized controlled trial design. The program was designed to fill a service gap during the summer prior to the middle school transition and to prevent delinquency, substance use, and related problems. One hundred girls in foster care and their caregivers were randomly assigned either to the intervention (n = 48) or to a regular foster care control (n = 52) condition. The girls completed a baseline (T1) assessment and follow-up assessments at 6 months (T2), 12 months (T3), 24 months (T4), and 36 months (T5) postbaseline. Caregivers participated in assessments from T1 through T4. This study is a follow-up to Smith, Leve, and Chamberlain's (2011) study, which examined immediate outcomes at T2. Girls in the intervention condition showed significantly lower levels of substance use than did girls in the control condition at 36 months postbaseline. The group difference was only marginally significant for delinquency. Further analyses indicated significant indirect effects of the intervention through increased prosocial behaviors that led to decreased internalizing and externalizing symptoms and then to lower levels of substance use. The direct effect of the intervention on substance use remained significant in the presence of the indirect effects. For delinquency, the intervention had positive effects mainly through increased prosocial skills. Findings highlight the importance of providing preventive intervention services for early adolescent girls in foster care.",1
"Psychosocial factors are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in healthy and clinical populations. Behavioral interventions are needed to train the large number of people in the community setting who are affected by stressors to use coping skills that will reduce these risk factors. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of three forms of delivery of a standardized, behavioral intervention-the Williams LifeSkills program-designed to reduce levels of psychosocial risk factors in nonclinical populations. One hundred ninety-six participants screening positive for elevated psychosocial distress were randomized to either a waitlist control group or one of three intervention groups: the LifeSkills Workshop, the LifeSkills Video, or the LifeSkills Video and Workshop combined. Psychosocial risk factors were evaluated at baseline and at 10 days, 2 months, and 6 months after the training/wait period. At 10 days follow up, the workshop + video and video-only groups showed significant improvements over control subjects in trait anxiety and perceived stress. Moreover, the workshop + video group maintained benefit over control subjects throughout 6 months follow up in both of these measures, whereas the video-only group maintained benefit in trait anxiety. Because the psychosocial well-being of two of the treated groups improved over that of the control group, it appears that the Williams LifeSkills program accelerates and maintains a normal return to low distress after a stressful time. This is the first study to show that a commercially available, facilitator- or self-administered behavioral training product can have significant beneficial effects on psychosocial well-being in a healthy community sample.",1
"Measures of hypnotic suggestibility and absorption were administered to 146 participants in the guise of different experiments. A spectral analysis was performed by correlating the difficulty of individual hypnotic suggestions with the magnitude of the association between suggestions and absorption. Contrary to the two-component model, absorption was not more highly correlated with passing difficult suggestions than easier suggestions. This was confirmed by a meta-analysis of this and other spectral analysis studies. In addition, cross-study correlations revealed that the magnitude of the association between absorption and individual suggestions is highly variable, rendering the two-component model very difficult to test. These findings indicate that discrepant results in previous spectral analyses may have been due to low reliability of associations with individual scale items, as well as the relatively small number of correlations that constitute the raw data of these analyses.",1
"Longitudinal neuroimaging investigations of antidepressant treatment offer the opportunity to identify potential baseline biomarkers associated with poor outcome. To explore the neural correlates of nonresponse to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or venlafaxine (VEN), we compared pretreatment (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography scans of participants with major depressive disorder responding to either 16 weeks of CBT (n = 7) or VEN treatment (n = 9) with treatment nonresponders (n = 8). Nonresponders to CBT or VEN, in contrast to responders, exhibited pretreatment hypermetabolism at the interface of the pregenual and subgenual cingulate cortices. Limitations of our study include the small sample sizes and the absence of both arterial sampling to determine absolute glucose metabolism and high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging coregistration for region-of-interest analyses. Our current findings are consistent with those reported in previous studies of relative hyperactivity in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex in treatment-resistant populations. ",1
"Evidence suggests that prenatal care, healthy behaviors such as exercise and nutrition, and general stress level are associated with fetal and maternal health but there is a relative dearth of research on interventions to improve these factors in pregnant substance users. Two hundred pregnant substance users entering outpatient substance abuse treatment were randomized to receive either three individual sessions of Motivational Enhancement Therapy for pregnant substance users (MET-PS) or the first three individual sessions normally provided by the program. The present study evaluated the relative efficacy of MET-PS, compared to treatment as usual, on modifiable healthy behaviors and the impact of treatment when the groups were pooled. The results suggest that MET-PS was not more effective than treatment as usual in improving modifiable healthy behaviors. When the treatment groups were pooled, the results suggest that there were significant increases in prenatal care utilization and prenatal/multi-vitamin and water consumption, and a significant decrease in stress. Limitations and recommendations for further research are discussed.",0
"To determine if vestibular stimulation is an effective therapy for transient insomnia in a sleep phase advance model. Multi-site, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, sham-controlled trial This study was carried out at 6 sites in the United States. 198 healthy normal sleepers. Bilateral electrical stimulation of the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear via electrodes on the skin of the mastoid process at a frequency of 0.5 Hz vs. sham stimulation. We did not find a significant effect of treatment on our primary outcome variable, latency to persistent sleep onset (LPS). However, our planned analysis identified that the mean latency to sleep onset on the multiple sleep latency test was a significant covariate. This led us to carry out post hoc analyses, which showed a significant effect of treatment on LPS in those subjects with a mean MSLT sleep onset latency > or = 14 minutes. Vestibular stimulation did not have a therapeutic effect in a model of transient insomnia in the overall population studied. However, this study provides preliminary evidence that vestibular stimulation may shorten sleep onset latency compared with sham therapy in the subset of subjects with mean MSLT sleep onset latency > or = 14 minutes.",0
"To assess the effects of playing patient-selected music during interventional procedures on (1) the doses of sedation and analgesia and (2) anxiety levels. Patients undergoing interventional radiological procedures were randomised to either the intervention (music) or the control (no music) group. Patients in the intervention group had music of their choice played via headphones during the procedure. The primary outcomes were reductions in the doses of drugs for sedation (midazolam) and analgesia (fentanyl). Anxiety levels were assessed both before and after the procedure using the validated State Anxiety Inventory. Mean pulse rate and average of mean blood pressures were also recorded before and during the procedures as surrogate indicators of anxiety levels. 100 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio. There were 58 males and 42 females, with a mean age of 58 years. Sedation was required in 21 (42%) patients in the music group compared with 30 (60%) patients in the control group (p=0.046). The mean [standard deviation (SD)] midazolam dose was 2.1 mg (2.3 mg) in the control group and 1.3 mg (2.2 mg) in the music group (p=0.027). The mean (SD) fentanyl dose was 29 mg (40 mg) in the control group and 18 mg (34 mg) in the music group (p=0.055). There was no significant effect of music on the change from baseline in anxiety levels (p=0.74), pulse rate (p=0.56) or blood pressure (p=0.34). Sedation requirements are significantly reduced by playing self-selected music to the patient during interventional radiology procedures. By lowering sedation during interventional radiology, music makes the procedure safer. It also contributes favourably to the overall patient experience.",0
"Using a controlled group outcome design, skin temperature biofeedback with autogenic training and autogenic training only was compared to a waiting list as a treatment for childhood headache. Thirty children with migraine headaches, ages 7 to 18 years were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Statistical analyses of headache activity indicated that children in the treatment groups improved in headache frequency and duration but not intensity as compared to the waiting list control group. These findings were consistent through a 6 month follow-up. In terms of clinical improvement, 80% of the biofeedback group, 50% of the autogenics group, and none of the waiting list control group were symptom-free. These findings were discussed in relation to past childhood headache studies and implications for current treatment of children with headaches.",1
"Medical procedures in outpatient settings have limited options of managing pain and anxiety pharmacologically. We therefore assessed whether this can be achieved by adjunct self-hypnotic relaxation in a common and particularly anxiety provoking procedure. Two hundred and thirty-six women referred for large core needle breast biopsy to an urban tertiary university-affiliated medical center were prospectively randomized to receive standard care (n=76), structured empathic attention (n=82), or self-hypnotic relaxation (n=78) during their procedures. Patients' self-ratings at 1 min-intervals of pain and anxiety on 0-10 verbal analog scales with 0=no pain/anxiety at all, 10=worst pain/anxiety possible, were compared in an ordinal logistic regression model. Women's anxiety increased significantly in the standard group (logit slope=0.18, p<0.001), did not change in the empathy group (slope=-0.04, p=0.45), and decreased significantly in the hypnosis group (slope=-0.27, p<0.001). Pain increased significantly in all three groups (logit slopes: standard care=0.53, empathy=0.37, hypnosis=0.34; all p<0.001) though less steeply with hypnosis and empathy than standard care (p=0.024 and p=0.018, respectively). Room time and cost were not significantly different in an univariate ANOVA despite hypnosis and empathy requiring an additional professional: 46 min/161 dollars for standard care, 43 min/163 dollars for empathy, and 39 min/152 dollars for hypnosis. We conclude that, while both structured empathy and hypnosis decrease procedural pain and anxiety, hypnosis provides more powerful anxiety relief without undue cost and thus appears attractive for outpatient pain management.",0
"Contracting and prompting clients to attend substance abuse treatment aftercare substantially improves treatment adherence and outcome. However, this approach has not been evaluated for improving entry into initial treatment. We recruited 102 individuals scheduled to begin a 28-day substance use disorder (SUD) residential treatment program and randomly assigned them to receive either our standard treatment (STX) or STX plus attendance contracting and prompting (CP). CP participants showed fewer subsequent hospitalization days, lower hospitalization costs, greater improvement in alcohol problem scores, and lower legal problem scores at a 3-month follow-up than the STX group. The two groups did not differ on treatment entry rate, time in treatment, or drug use problem scores. The clinical utility of CP procedures and areas for future research are discussed.",0
"To conduct a controlled group outcome investigation of the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral treatment for school phobia. Fifty-six children with school phobia were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of cognitive-behavioral therapy or an attention-placebo control condition. Pre- and posttreatment school attendance, self-reported anxiety and depression, and diagnostic status were compared. Both the experimental and control treatments were equally effective at returning children to school. Both treatments also were effective in reducing children's anxiety and depressive symptoms. Follow-up revealed no differences between groups when the children reentered school the next school year. Overall, results suggest that psychosocial treatments are effective at returning school-phobic children to school and that the highly structured cognitive-behavioral approach may not be superior to more traditional educational and supportive treatment methods.",0
"Agitated behaviours among persons with dementia are distressing to both patients and their caregivers. As pharmacological interventions may be limited by their potentially adverse effects, the use of complementary therapies for treatment of agitation has become more popular and aromatherapy is the fastest growing one. This study investigates the effectiveness of lavandula angustifolia (lavender) in treating agitated behaviours of demented people in Hong Kong. It was a cross-over randomized trial. Seventy Chinese older adults with dementia were recruited; half were randomly assigned to the active group (lavender inhalation) for three weeks and then switched to control group (sunflower inhalation) for another three weeks; the other half did the opposite. Clinical response was evaluated using the Chinese versions of Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CCMAI) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (CNPI). The mean CCMAI total scores decreased from 24.68 to 17.77(t=10.79, df=69, p<0.001). The CNPI scores changed from 63.17 (SD=17.81) to 58.77 (SD=16.74) (t=14.59, df=69, p<0.001) after receiving Treatment A (Lavandula Angustifolia). There were no period and sequential effects noted. In summary, lavender is effective as an adjunctive therapy in alleviating agitated behaviours in Chinese patients with dementia. In a patient population particularly vulnerable to side effects of psychotropic medications, aromatherapy using lavender may offer an alternative option.",0
"Our research group has developed an internet-delivered cognitive behavioral treatment (ICBT) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We compared ICBT with internet-delivered stress management (ISM) for IBS to assess whether the effects of ICBT are specific. This was a randomized controlled trial, including 195 self-referred participants diagnosed with IBS. The treatment interventions lasted for 10 weeks and included an online therapist contact. The ICBT emphasized acceptance of symptoms through exposure to IBS symptoms and related negative feelings. The ICBT also included mindfulness training. The ISM emphasized symptom control through relaxation techniques, dietary adjustments, and problem-solving skills. Severity of IBS symptoms was measured with the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale-IBS version (GSRS-IBS). Credibility of the treatments and expectancy of improvement were assessed with the treatment credibility scale. The participants' perceived therapeutic alliance with their online therapist was measured with the working alliance inventory. At post-treatment and 6-month follow-up, 192 (99%) and 169 (87%) participants returned data, respectively. At post-treatment and 6-month follow-up, we found significant differences on the GSRS-IBS, favoring ICBT. The difference on GSRS-IBS scores was 4.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-8.4) at post-treatment and 5.9 (95% CI: 1.9-9.9) at 6-month follow-up. There were no significant differences on the treatment credibility scale or the working alliance inventory between the groups. Internet-delivered CBT has specific effects that cannot be attributed only to treatment credibility, expectancy of improvement, therapeutic alliance, or attention. Furthermore, a treatment based on exposure exercises specifically tailored for IBS may be a better treatment option than general stress and symptom management for IBS patients. ICBT is a promising treatment modality for IBS as it can be offered to IBS patients in much larger scale than conventional psychological treatments.",0
"Dropout of treatment is one of the key issues in outcome in a child and adolescent mental health service. We report two studies focusing on the treatment process and the dropout rate of children with persistent conduct problems presenting to a community mental health service, using a prospective design. The first study included 32 children and used a randomised controlled treatment design comparing a CBT approach with conjoint family therapy and an eclectic approach. The overall dropout rate was 36%. Dropout occurred significantly less frequently in the CBT group. The dropout group was associated with mothers who were younger and less educated, a poorer rating by the clinicians at the last meeting, parental dissatisfaction with the treatment service and perception that the treatment was less organised and having less behavioural tasks. In the second study we used a naturalistic follow-up design. Forty-six children were included. The overall dropout rate was 48%. Again, the children who defaulted were rated by clinicians as less likely to have improved and dropout was also significantly associated with parental perception of a less organised treatment. In both studies dropout usually occurred after assessment and at the early phase of treatment.",1
"Patients who experience the onset of psychotic illness with a comorbid diagnosis of cannabis dependence experience poor clinical outcomes. Few studies have identified interventions that reduce cannabis use and improve clinical outcome in this population. We undertook a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of a group psychological intervention for psychosis with comorbid cannabis dependence to determine whether there was any impact on cannabis use symptoms, global functioning, insight, attitudes to treatment and subjective quality of life. Across three centers, we compared a group psychological intervention, based on cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing, with treatment as usual among patients experiencing their first psychotic episode or early in the course of psychotic illness. Substance misuse and indices of clinical outcome were assessed at baseline, 3months and 1year. At 3month and 1year follow-ups, there was no evidence for an intervention effect on cannabis use, symptoms, global functioning insight or attitude to treatment. However, the intervention improved subjective quality of life at 3months and this effect was sustained at 1year. Over the early phase of psychotic illness, group psychological interventions for those with comorbid cannabis dependence improved subjective quality of life. However, this was not associated with reduction in use of cannabis or improvement in clinical outcomes.",0
"The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness of adherence therapy-a brief intervention based on compliance therapy and motivational interviewing techniques-in a sample of people with schizophrenia in Thailand. Poor adherence is problematic, but knowledge about how to improve medication adherence is limited. Studies focusing on the effects of interventions used to improve adherence have produced inconsistent outcomes and have been mainly conducted in western countries. An exploratory single blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Thirty-two patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to receive eight weekly sessions of adherence therapy or continue with their treatment as usual. Patients were assessed at baseline and after nine weeks. The primary outcome was overall psychotic symptoms. Secondary outcomes were general functioning, attitude towards and satisfaction with antipsychotic medication and medication side effects. The findings of this study indicated that patients who received adherence therapy significantly improved in overall psychotic symptoms, attitude towards and satisfaction with medication compared with treatment as usual but no significant difference was found in general functioning or side effects compared with treatment as usual. Adherence therapy has a positive impact on patients' psychiatric symptoms, attitude towards and satisfaction with medication. Nurses can effectively deliver adherence therapy following intensive training.",0
"A randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the influence of two formats of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (individual vs. group) in the treatment of alcohol and/or drug dependent patients. Public outpatient drug dependence service. One hundred and fifty-five alcohol and/or drug-dependent patients. The patients were randomly assigned to individual (n = 77) or group (n = 78) treatment formats. The treatment was developed into two phases: acquisition (eight sessions) and maintenance (nine sessions), distributed over an 8-month period. Alcohol and drug use, severity of dependence, and alcohol- and drug-related problems were evaluated at pre-treatment and 15 months after admission to treatment. At follow-up evaluation both groups of patients presented similar levels of drug consumption, dependence and associated problems. Although group-treated patients reported slightly higher levels of alcohol consumption (both at baseline and follow-up) differences between the formats disappear if baseline levels are included as covariates. Compliance with treatment and a measure of drug severity were predictors of success for the drug dependents. The number of sessions attended and high GGT levels at admission were positively correlated with success for the alcohol dependents. The two modalities presented similar outcomes and, as the group format could present a better cost-benefit ratio, it may be used without decreasing compliance with treatment or treatment effectiveness.",1
"The possibility that daily sessions of music-guided slow breathing may reduce 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), and predictors of efficacy were explored in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with parallel design. Age-matched and sex-matched hypertensive patients were randomized to music-guided slow breathing exercises (4-6 breaths/min; 1: 2 ratio of inspiration: expiration duration) (Intervention; n = 29) or to control groups who were thought to relax while either listening to slow music (Control-M; n = 26) or reading a book (Control-R; n = 31). At baseline and at follow-up visits (1 week and 1, 3 and 6 months), ABP monitoring was performed. At mixed model analysis, intervention was associated with a significant reduction of 24-h (P = 0.001) and night-time (0100-0600 h) (P < 0.0001) systolic ABP. The average reduction of systolic 24-h ABP at 6 months was 4.6 mmHg [confidence limits at 95% 1.93-7.35] and 4.1 mmHg (95% confidence limits 1.59-6.67) vs. Control-M and Control-R groups, respectively, (P < 0.001 for both). Antihypertensive treatment was selected as negative predictor of BP reduction at multivariate stepwise analysis. When antihypertensive treatment was inserted as covariate in a generalized linear model, psychological subscales assessed at baseline by the Mental Health Inventory questionnaire were found to affect systolic blood pressure reduction at 6-month follow-up (general positive affect P < 0.001; emotional ties, P < 0.001; loss of behavioral control, P = 0.035). In particular, a level of general positive affect higher than the 75th percentiles was found to be significantly associated with low treatment efficacy (odds ratio 0.09; 95% confidence limits 0.01-0.93). Daily sessions of voluntary music-guided slow breathing significantly reduce 24-h systolic ABP, and psychological predictors of efficacy can be identified.",1
"A sample of 44 male Type A insurance representatives, selected by means of the Videotaped Structured Interview, were randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 22) and a delayed treatment control group (n = 22). The treatment group participated in 9 weekly sessions of group Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy and were followed up after 10 weeks. After the control period, the delayed treatment control group received the same treatment program. Repeated measurements were obtained by means of the Videotaped Structured Interview, Jenkins Activity Survey, Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, and Type A Cognitive Questionnaire. Self and spouse/friend ratings of Type A behavior were obtained by means of the Bortner Rating Scale. Analysis indicated that, compared to the control condition, the therapy significantly reduced the intensity of Type A behavior and its time urgency component. These improvements were maintained at follow-up and were accompanied by self-reports of significant positive changes in Type A behavior and irrational beliefs.",1
"As the number of pathological gamblers has increased recently, the need for effective treatment has become more evident. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term cognitive-behavioural group therapy programme for pathological gamblers. Fourteen subjects (three females and 11 males), who met the criteria for pathological gambling in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, were randomly assigned to a Treatment Group (n=7) or a waiting list Control Group (n=7). An experimental design with three repeated measures was used (pre-treatment, post-treatment/post-waiting list and follow-up). The dependent variables were DSM-IV Criteria for Pathological Gambling, Money Spent on Gambling During the Last Week and Gamblers Inventory of Negative Consequences. The Treatment Group improved on the DSM-IV Criteria for Pathological Gambling, but did not show a significant improvement on Money Spent on Gambling During the Last week from pre-treatment to post-treatment. Combining both groups at 3-months follow-up, there was a significant improvement on all three variables from pre-treatment to follow-up. The results of this controlled study indicate that a short-term cognitive-behavioural group treatment for pathological gamblers had an effect.",0
"In the present study, the authors sought to determine whether the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for panic disorder could be improved by adjunctive computer-assisted therapy. Eighteen participants who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., revised; American Psychiatric Association, 1987) criteria for panic disorder were randomly assigned to a 12-session CBT (CBT 12) condition (D. H. Barlow & M. G. Craske, 1989) or to a 4-session computer-assisted CBT (CBT4-CA) condition. Palmtop computers, with a program developed to incorporate basic principles of CBT, were used by CBT4-CA clients whenever they felt anxious or wanted to practice the therapy techniques and were used by all participants as a momentary assessment tool. CBT4-CA clients carried the computer at all times and continued to use it for 8 weeks after termination of therapy. Analyses of clinically significant changes showed superiority of CBT12 at posttest on some measures; however, there were no differences at follow-up.",0
"Substance-dependent patients (N=29) living with a family member other than a spouse were randomly assigned to equally intensive treatments consisting of either (a) Behavioral Family Counseling (BFC) plus Individual-Based Treatment (IBT) or (b) IBT alone. Outcome data were collected at baseline, post-treatment, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. BFC patients remained in treatment significantly longer than IBT patients. BFC patients improved significantly from baseline at all time periods on all outcomes studied, and had a medium effect size reflecting better primary outcomes of increased abstinence and reduced substance use than IBT patients. For secondary outcomes of reduced negative consequences and improved relationship adjustment, both BFC and IBT patients improved significantly and to an equivalent extent. The present results show BFC is a promising method for retaining patients in treatment, increasing abstinence, and reducing substance use. These results also provide support for larger scale, randomized trials examining the efficacy of behavioral family counseling for patients living with family members beyond spouses.",1
"To compare the feasibility and efficacy of a programme combining imagery and occupational therapy with a programme of therapy only. Randomized, controlled case series. Subacute outpatient clinic. Thirteen consecutively admitted patients between four weeks and one year post stroke exhibiting stable motor deficits in their affected upper limbs. All patients received an hour of therapy three times a week for six weeks administered by the same physical and occupational therapists. During the same period, eight patients participated in 10-minute guided imagery sessions after each therapy session, as well as practising imagery at home twice each week. Five patients participated in a control intervention consisting of exposure to stroke information. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery (Fugl-Meyer) and Action Research Arm Test (ARA). After intervention, Fugl-Meyer and ARA scores of patients in the therapy only group remained virtually the same; therapy plus imagery group scores improved by 13.8 and 16.4 points, respectively, on the Fugl-Meyer and ARA. Imagery is a clinically feasible, cost-effective complement to therapy that may improve outcomes more than participation in therapy only.",1
"Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) has been found to be an effective way to disseminate psychological treatment, and support given by a therapist seems to be important in order to achieve good outcomes. Little is known about what the therapists actually do when they provide support in iCBT and whether their behaviour influences treatment outcome. This study addressed the content of therapist e-mails in guided iCBT for generalized anxiety disorder. We examined 490 e-mails from three therapists providing support to 44 patients who participated in a controlled trial on iCBT for generalized anxiety disorder. Through content analysis of the written correspondence, eight distinguishable therapist behaviours were derived: deadline flexibility, task reinforcement, alliance bolstering, task prompting, psychoeducation, self-disclosure, self-efficacy shaping, and empathetic utterances. We found that task reinforcement, task prompting, self-efficacy shaping and empathetic utterances correlated with module completion. Deadline flexibility was negatively associated with outcome and task reinforcement positively correlated with changes on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. Different types of therapist behaviours can be identified in iCBT, and though many of these behaviours are correlated to each other, different behaviours have an impact on change in symptoms and module completion.",1
"Cardiovascular disease remains the leading killer of women in most developed areas of the world. Rates of physical inactivity and poor nutrition, which are two of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease in women, are substantial. This study sought to examine the effectiveness of a community-based lifestyle-modification program on increasing women's physical activity in a randomized trial guided by community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. A total of 335 healthy, 25-64 years old women who had been selected by a multiple-stage stratified cluster random sampling method in Bushehr Port/I.R. Iran, were randomized into control and intervention groups. The intervention group completed an 8-week lifestyle modification program for increasing their physical activity, based on a revised form of Choose to Move program; an American Heart Association Physical Activity Program for Women. Audio-taped activity instructions with music and practical usage of the educational package were given to the intervention group in weekly home-visits by 53 volunteers from local non-governmental and community-based organizations. Among the participants, the percentage who reported being active (at lease 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity for at least 5 days a week, or at least 20 minutes of vigorous physical activity for at least three days a week) increased from 3% and 2.7% at baseline to 13.4% and 3% (p < 0.0001) at the ending of the program in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The participants in the intervention group reported more minutes of physical activity per week (mean = 139.81, SE = 23.35) than women in the control group (mean = 40.14, SE = 12.65) at week 8 (p < 0.0001). The intervention group subjects exhibited a significantly greater decrease in systolic blood pressure (-10.0 mmHg) than the control group women (+2.0. mmHg). The mean ranks for posttest healthy heart knowledge in the intervention and control groups were 198.91 and 135.77, respectively (P < 0.0001). An intervention based on CBPR methods can be effective for the short-term adoption of physical activity behavior among women. The development of participatory process to support the adequate delivery of lifestyle-modification programs is feasible and an effective healthcare delivery strategy for cardiovascular community health promotion. ACTRNO12606000521527.",1
"Because some literature reviews have suggested that naltrexone's benefit may be limited to less-severe alcohol dependence, and exclusively to reduction in heavy drinking rather than abstinence, we examined the efficacy of once per month, injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX 380 mg) in patients with relatively higher severity alcohol dependence. Post hoc analyses examined data from a multicenter, placebo-controlled, 24-week randomized trial of XR-NTX for alcohol dependence (N = 624). We analyzed treatment effects in alcohol-dependent patients who had higher baseline severity, as measured by: (i) the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) or (ii) having been medically detoxified in the week before randomization. Efficacy was also examined via the relationship between pretreatment severity indices and reporting at least 4 days of lead-in abstinence prior to treatment-a major predictor of good outcome in the original study. Higher severity alcohol-dependent patients, defined by the ADS, when receiving XR-NTX 380 mg (n = 50) compared with placebo (n = 47), had significantly fewer heavy-drinking days in-trial (hazard ratio=0.583; p = 0.0049) and showed an average reduction of 37.3% in heavy-drinking days compared with 27.4% for placebo-treated patients (p = 0.039). Among those who had a detoxification just prior to randomization, these reductions were 48.9% (XR-NTX 380 mg; n = 11) and 30.9% (placebo; n = 15) (p = 0.004). Subjects with at least 4 days of pretreatment abstinence (n = 82) versus those without (n = 542) had significantly higher pretreatment ADS scores (p = 0.002) and were more likely to require detoxification prior to randomization (p < 0.001). Patients with lead-in abstinence experienced significantly better maintenance of initial and 6-month abstinence. These secondary analyses support the efficacy of XR-NTX 380 mg in relatively higher severity alcohol dependence for both reduction in heavy drinking and maintenance of abstinence, with implications for the role of adherence pharmacotherapy.",1
"For over 2 decades, oncology nurses at a regional comprehensive cancer center offered sliced oranges to patients during the reinfusion of autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) to relieve symptoms associated with the preservative dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This randomized pilot study examined feasibility and efficacy of sliced orange intervention (OI), orange aromatherapy intervention (OAI), or deep breathing (control) to address unpleasant adverse effects during HPC infusion. Orange intervention sniffed or tasted a quartered orange, OAI sniffed orange aromatherapy, and control took deep breaths. Perceived ""symptom intensity"" for tickle/cough urge, nausea, retching, and perceived ""relief"" were measured on 0- to 10-point numerical scales. Sixty of 72 eligible patients consented to participate and were randomized to OI (n = 19), OAI (n = 23), or control (n = 18). Study personnel successfully administered study procedures. Over the course of 2 bags of cells infused, the OI group reported significantly greater relief with the intervention (P = .032). Among participants less than 90 kg, OI group reported significantly lower symptom intensity (P = .012). Results suggest a feasible protocol and potential efficacy of sliced oranges for treating symptoms associated with DMSO-preserved stem cells. Study procedures provide a tested protocol for future studies. Follow-up study is warranted to confirm these findings and evaluate other treatment options. Oranges offer a simple, noninvasive intervention for relieving symptoms associated with DMSO preservative during autologous HPC infusion.",1
"We undertook a randomised controlled trial to assess whether a music therapy (MT) scheme of administration, including three working cycles of one month spaced out by one month of no treatment, is effective to reduce behavioural disturbances in severely demented patients. Sixty persons with severe dementia (30 in the experimental and 30 in the control group) were enrolled. Baseline multidimensional assessment included demographics, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Barthel Index and Neuropsychiatry Inventory (NPI) for all patients. All the patients of the experimental and control groups received standard care (educational and entertainment activities). In addition, the experimental group received three cycles of 12 active MT sessions each, three times a week. Each 30-min session included a group of three patients. Every cycle of treatment was followed by one month of wash-out. At the end of this study, MT treatment resulted to be more effective than standard care to reduce behavioural disorders. We observed a significant reduction over time in the NPI global scores in both groups (F(7,357) = 9.06, p < 0.001) and a significant difference between groups (F(1,51) = 4.84, p < 0.05) due to a higher reduction of behavioural disturbances in the experimental group at the end of the treatment (Cohen's d = 0.63). The analysis of single NPI items shows that delusions, agitation and apathy significantly improved in the experimental, but not in the control group. This study suggests the effectiveness of MT approach with working cycles in reducing behavioural disorders of severely demented patients.",1
"Sixty-eight 3-year-olds received a standard appearance-reality task along with either a trick task, in which the appearance question was placed in the context of a deceptive game, or a reduced information processing task, in which a dual object (e.g., a sponge-rock) was presented along with an object that matched the dual object's identity (a sponge) and one that matched the dual object's appearance (a rock). Children were more likely to pass either the trick or reduced information processing task and fail the standard than the reverse. Thus, 3-year-olds can grasp the distinction between appearance and reality (a) when their goal is to trick someone, which may prime them to think about the other's mental state, and (b) when they do not need to held conflicting object identities in mind at the same time.",1
"Approximately half of American adults do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines. Face-to-face lifestyle interventions improve health outcomes but are unlikely to yield population-level improvements because they can be difficult to disseminate, expensive to maintain, and inconvenient for the recipient. In contrast, Internet-based behavior change interventions can be disseminated widely at a lower cost. However, the impact of some Internet-mediated programs is limited by high attrition rates. Online communities that allow participants to communicate with each other by posting and reading messages may decrease participant attrition. Our objective was to measure the impact of adding online community features to an Internet-mediated walking program on participant attrition and average daily step counts. This randomized controlled trial included sedentary, ambulatory adults who used email regularly and had at least 1 of the following: overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 25), type 2 diabetes, or coronary artery disease. All participants (n = 324) wore enhanced pedometers throughout the 16-week intervention and uploaded step-count data to the study server. Participants could log in to the study website to view graphs of their walking progress, individually-tailored motivational messages, and weekly calculated goals. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 versions of a Web-based walking program. Those randomized to the ""online community"" arm could post and read messages with other participants while those randomized to the ""no online community"" arm could not read or post messages. The main outcome measures were participant attrition and average daily step counts over 16 weeks. Multiple regression analyses assessed the effect of the online community access controlling for age, sex, disease status, BMI, and baseline step counts. Both arms significantly increased their average daily steps between baseline and the end of the intervention period, but there were no significant differences in increase in step counts between arms using either intention-to-treat or completers analysis. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the average step count increase across both arms was 1888 ± 2400 steps. The percentage of completers was 13% higher in the online community arm than the no online community arm (online community arm, 79%, no online community arm, 66%, P = .02). In addition, online community arm participants remained engaged in the program longer than no online community arm participants (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.25 - 0.90, P = .02). Participants with lower baseline social support posted more messages to the online community (P < .001) and viewed more posts (P < .001) than participants with higher baseline social support. Adding online community features to an Internet-mediated walking program did not increase average daily step counts but did reduce participant attrition. Participants with low baseline social support used the online community features more than those with high baseline social support. Thus, online communities may be a promising approach to reducing attrition from online health behavior change interventions, particularly in populations with low social support.

"To evaluate the long term effect of ongoing intervention to improve treatment of depression in primary care. Randomised controlled trial. Twelve primary care practices across the United States. 211 adults beginning a new treatment episode for major depression; 94% of patients assigned to ongoing intervention participated. Practices assigned to ongoing intervention encouraged participating patients to engage in active treatment, using practice nurses to provide care management over 24 months. Patients' report of remission and functioning. Ongoing intervention significantly improved both symptoms and functioning at 24 months, increasing remission by 33 percentage points (95% confidence interval 7% to 46%), improving emotional functioning by 24 points (11 to 38) and physical functioning by 17 points (6 to 28). By 24 months, 74% of patients in enhanced care reported remission, with emotional functioning exceeding 90% of population norms and physical functioning approaching 75% of population norms. Ongoing intervention increased remission rates and improved indicators of emotional and physical functioning. Studies are needed to compare the cost effectiveness of ongoing depression management with other chronic disease treatment routinely undertaken by primary care.",1
Comorbidity of substance abuse disorders (SUD) and psychiatric disorders is one of the most important areas of investigation in contemporary drug abuse treatment research. This study examined the impact of psychiatric comorbidity on the treatment of 182 adolescent drug abusers in a randomized clinical trial comparing family and individual cognitive-behavioral therapy. Three distinct groups of adolescent substance abusers were compared: (1) Exclusive Substance Abusers (SUD only); (2) Externalizers (SUD + externalizing disorder); and (3) Mixed Substance Abusers (SUD + externalizing and internalizing disorder). The purpose of this study was to determine whether adolescents in these comorbid groups differed in clinical presentation and treatment response. More severe comorbidity was associated with greater family dysfunction and being female and younger at intake. An examination of substance use trajectories over time indicated that the Mixed group initially responded to treatment but returned to intake levels of substance use by 1 year post-discharge.,1
"To examine attention bias toward threat faces in a large sample of anxiety-disordered youths using a well-established visual probe task. Study participants included 101 children and adolescents (ages 7-18 years) with generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety disorder enrolled in a multisite anxiety treatment study. Nonanxious youths (n = 51; ages 9-18 years) were recruited separately. Participants were administered a computerized visual probe task that presents pairs of faces portraying threat (angry), positive (happy), and neutral expressions. They pressed a response key to indicate the spatial location of a probe that replaced one of the faces on each trial. Attention bias scores were calculated from response times to probes for each emotional face type. Compared to healthy youths, anxious participants demonstrated a greater attention bias toward threat faces. This threat bias in anxious patients did not significantly vary across the anxiety disorders. There was no group difference in attention bias toward happy faces. These results suggest that pediatric anxiety disorders are associated with an attention bias toward threat. Future research may examine the manner in which cognitive bias in anxious youths changes with treatment.",0
"The aim of the current pilot study was to compare two strategies in the application of the cognitive differentiation program of Integrated Psychological Therapy for people with schizophrenia. Twenty-six outpatients were randomly assigned to the application of the program in group sessions (CDg), or to its application in individualized sessions (CDi). The program provides cognitive exercises to promote better performance in cognition, and both groups of participants completed the same number of exercises following the same number of sessions per week. Outcomes were assessed on neuropsychological measures of attention, executive functioning and everyday memory, and everyday functioning. Effect sizes showed the absence of effects in everyday memory and social functioning, higher improvements in the CDi group in attention, and a higher improvement in the CDg condition in executive functioning. The results suggest that the program application model could be individualized, depending on patient-specific cognitive deficits.",0
"Patients on long-term sick-leave (> 90 days) from white collar work, with a diagnosis of work-related depression, dysthymia, or maladaptive stress reaction were randomized either to cognitive group therapy (CGT), focused psychodynamic group therapy (FGT), or to a comparison group. All patients were interviewed and responded to self-report questionnaires before the start of treatment and at 6 and 12 months. At the 12-month follow-up, 70% of the patients met the criteria for reliable change of the target symptom (depression), and the sample as a whole improved significantly on all measures used. However, there were no differences in outcome between the three treatment groups.",0
"To assess how patients' underlying anxiety affects their experience of distress, use of resources, and responsiveness toward nonpharmacologic analgesia adjunct therapies during invasive procedures. Two hundred thirty-six patients undergoing vascular and renal interventions, who had been randomized to receive during standard care treatment, structured empathic attention, or self-hypnotic relaxation, were divided into two groups: those with low state anxiety scores on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, scores < 43; n = 116) and those with high state anxiety scores (> or = 43; n = 120). All had access to patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl and midazolam. Every 15 minutes during the procedure, patients rated their anxiety and pain on a scale of 0-10 (0, no pain/anxiety at all; 10, worst possible pain/anxiety). Effects were assessed by analysis of variance and repeated-measures analysis. Patients with high state anxiety levels required significantly greater procedure time and medication. Empathic attention as well as hypnosis treatment reduced procedure time and medication use for all patients. These nonpharmacologic analgesia adjunct treatments also provided significantly better pain control than standard care for patients with low anxiety levels. Anxiety decreased over the time of the procedure; patients with high state anxiety levels experienced the most significant decreases in anxiety with nonpharmacologic adjuncts whereas patients with low state anxiety levels coped relatively well under all conditions. Patients' state anxiety level is a predictor of trends in procedural pain and anxiety, need for medication, and procedure duration. Low and high state anxiety groups profit from the use of nonpharmacologic analgesia adjuncts but those with high state anxiety levels have the most to gain.",1
"To examine longer-term effectiveness of a needs-based family intervention for carers and out-patients suffering from schizophrenia. Seventy-nine unselected patient-carer pairs were recruited from a geographical area and allocated randomly to one of two conditions. One group received needs-based cognitive-behavioural family intervention in combination with general family support plus the standard care. The control group received the general family support and standard care only. Analysis was carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. There was a significant advantage for family intervention, in terms of relapse (37% relapsed compared to 72%, NNT=3) and on other clinical measures. Treatment group and medication compliance were significant and independent predictors of relapse. There was a significant reduction in carer needs in the intervention group. Family intervention directed at carers' needs within a standard mental health service can produce benefits for patients beyond the term of intervention.",1
"As more methadone treatment programs are funded in an attempt to curb substance abuse and HIV infection among i.v. drug users, more cost effective treatment approaches are being sought. To investigate whether clients in outpatient methadone maintenance treatment who practice weekly Hatha yoga in a group setting experience more favorable treatment outcomes than those who receive conventional group psychodynamic therapy. After a 5-day assessment period, 61 patients were randomly assigned to methadone maintenance enhanced by traditional group psychotherapy (ie, conventional methadone treatment) or an alternative Hatha yoga therapy (ie, alternative methadone treatment). Patients were followed for 6 months and evaluated on a variety of psychological, sociological, and biological measures. The revised Symptom Check List provided the primary psychological measures; the Addiction Severity Index provided various indices of addictive behaviors. The evidence revealed that there were no meaningful differences between traditional psychodynamic group therapy and Hatha yoga presented in a group setting. Both treatments contributed to a treatment regimen that significantly reduced drug use and criminal activities. Psychopathology at admission was significantly related to program participation regardless of treatment group. In addition to examining the characteristics of patients who present for treatment, this study identifies unexpected staff issues that complicate the integration of alternative and traditional treatment strategies. Alternative methadone treatment is not more effective than conventional methadone treatment, as originally hypothesized. However, some patients may benefit more from alternative methadone treatment than conventional methadone treatment. Additional research is necessary to determine characteristics that identify patients who might benefit from alternative methadone treatment.",0
"This study aimed to investigate the course of depression for patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to investigate predictors of depression. Twenty-two patients with a history of recently diagnosed RA of less than 2 years were assessed on a variety of clinical outcome and process measures on six assessment occasions over a 21-month period. These 22 patients constituted the control group of a controlled trial and received standard outpatient clinic treatment during follow-up. Patients became significantly more depressed over time. A set of five factors were found to consistently predict depression at the following assessment. These were initial level of depression, disability, pain, beliefs about the consequences of arthritis and coping strategies. The results confirm the importance of psychological factors in early RA and their relative independence from physical findings. This is the first study to document the importance of illness perceptions in recent onset RA.",1
"There is a growing body of evidence that psychologic stressors can affect physical health and proneness to disease through depletion of the body's immune system. Relatively little research, however, has investigated the potential immunoenhancing effect of stress-relieving strategies such as progressive muscle relaxation. This study explored the relationship between immune functioning and relaxation training with persons experiencing persistent facial pain. In a single experimental session, 21 subjects either received relaxation training or rested for an equivalent time period. Salivary immunoglobulin A, mood, pain, and tension levels were measured before and after relaxation and rest periods. Results indicated that a greater proportion of those receiving relaxation training had increases in secretion of salivary immunoglobulin A. These findings suggest that immunoenhancement may be another potential benefit of progressive relaxation training for persons with chronic pain conditions.",1
"Thirty children and their parents were assigned randomly to either time-unlimited or time-limited (12 sessions) psychodynamically oriented treatments or to a minimal-contact control group. All groups showed significant improvements from pretest to posttest. Comparisons between groups at posttest on parental measures of family functioning showed that changes reported by the minimal-contact control group were significantly greater than those of the time-unlimited group. When assessments from pretest to 4-year follow-up were compared, all groups improved significantly on therapist measures of goal attainment, but only the minimal-contact control group reported significant improvements on severity of target problems and measures of family functioning. The results of this study suggest that long-term therapy does not necessarily provide more effective therapy. These findings have important implications for clinical practice, service delivery, and research, particularly in the present climate of financial restraint in health care.",1
"Prior research by the authors tested a model of factors influencing parent inclination to participate in parenting interventions. Family context, belief, attitude, and inclination to participate variables from this model were used to predict the actual participation of 1,121 families in assessment and intervention activities of a family-focused preventive intervention research project. Invitations to the project assessment and intervention components were, respectively, about 6 months and 10 months following the initiation of a telephone survey collecting predictor variable data. Logistic regression analyses examining each predictor individually showed that a number of family context, belief, attitude, and inclination variables were predictive of project participation. Subsequently, multiple logistic regressions were conducted, entering variables by blocks corresponding to theoretical model components. These analyses showed that prospectively stated inclination to participate in a parenting intervention and level of education were consistently significant predictors of both assessment participation and intervention enrollment. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.",1
"Two hundred forty-six African American adolescents were randomly assigned to an educational program or an 8-week intervention that combined education with behavior skills training including correct condom use, sexual assertion, refusal, information provision, self-management, problem solving, and risk recognition. Skill-trained participants (a) reduced unprotected intercourse, (b) increased condom-protected intercourse, and (c) displayed increased behavioral skills to a greater extent than participants who received information alone. The patterns of change differed by gender. Risk reduction was maintained 1 year later for skill-trained youths. It was found that 31.1% of youths in the education program who were abstinent at baseline had initiated sexual activity 1 year later, whereas only 11.5% of skills training participants were sexually active. The results indicate that youths who were equipped with information and specific skills lowered their risk to a greater degree, maintained risk reduction changes better, and deferred the onset of sexual activity to a greater extent than youths who received information alone.",1
"To test, in combination with the nicotine patch, the incremental efficacy of a maximal, tailored behavioral treatment over a minimal treatment for smoking cessation. Randomized clinical trial with 6-month follow-up. Five methadone maintenance treatment centers in Rhode Island. Three hundred and eighty-three methadone-maintained smokers. Participants were assigned randomly to nicotine patch (8-12 weeks) plus either (1) a baseline tailored brief motivational intervention, a quit date behavioral skills counseling session and a relapse prevention follow-up session (Max) or (2) brief advice using the National Cancer Institute's 4 As model (Min). An intent-to-treat analysis with those lost to follow-up assumed to smoke was used. Carbon monoxide (CO)-confirmed 7-day point smoking cessation prevalence at 3 and 6 months, and self-reported numbers of cigarettes smoked per day. Participants had a mean age of 40 years, were 53% male, 78% Caucasian, smoked 26.7 (+/- 12.2) cigarettes/day and had a mean methadone dose of 95.5 mg. At 3 months, 317 (83%) were re-interviewed; at 6 months, 312 (82%) were re-interviewed. The intent-to-treat, 7-day point prevalence estimate of cessation was 5.2% in the Max group and 4.7% in the Min group (P=0.81) at 6 months. In logistic models with treatment condition, age, gender, race, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence and cigarettes per day as covariates, males were more likely to be abstinent at 3 months (OR 4.67; P=0.003) and 6 months (OR 4.01; P=0.015). A tailored behavioral intervention did not increase quit rates over patch and minimal treatment. Smoking cessation rates in methadone-maintained smokers are low, with men having greater success.",0
"The authors draw on sociometer theory (e.g., Leary, 2004) and self-verification theory (e.g., Swann, 1997) to propose an expanded model of the regulatory function of self-esteem. The model suggests that people not only possess an acceptance signaling system that indicates whether relational value is high or low but also possess an epistemic signaling system that indicates whether social feedback is consistent or inconsistent with chronic perceived relational value (i.e., global self-esteem). One correlational study and 5 experiments, with diverse operationalizations of social feedback, demonstrated that the epistemic signaling system responds to self-esteem consistent or inconsistent relational-value feedback with increases or deceases in epistemic certainty. Moreover, Studies 3-6 demonstrated that the acceptance and epistemic signaling systems respond uniquely to social feedback. Finally, Studies 5 and 6 provide evidence that the epistemic signaling system is part of a broader self-regulatory system: Self-esteem inconsistent feedback caused cognitive efforts to decrease the discrepancy between self-views and feedback and caused depleted self-regulatory capacity on a subsequent self-control task.",1
"This experimental study aimed to evaluate the effects of a group music intervention on anxiety and agitation of institutionalized older adults with dementia. A total of 60 participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group received a 30-min music intervention using percussion instruments with familiar music in a group setting in mid afternoon twice weekly for 6 weeks, whereas the control group received usual care with no music intervention. The Rating of Anxiety in Dementia scale was used to assess anxiety, and Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory was used to assess agitation at baseline, week 4 and week 6. Repeated measures analysis of covariance indicated that older adults who received a group music intervention had a significantly lower anxiety score than those in the control group while controlling for pre-test score and cognitive level (F = 8.98, p = 0.004). However, the reduction of agitation between two groups was not significantly different. Anxiety and agitation are common in older adults with dementia and have been reported by caregivers as challenging care problems. An innovative group music intervention using percussion instruments with familiar music as a cost-effective approach has the potential to reduce anxiety and improve psychological well-being of those with dementia.",0
"Despite neuroleptic medication, many schizophrenic patients continue to experience residual positive psychotic symptoms. These residual symptoms cause distress and disability. We report a controlled trial of two cognitive-behavioural treatments to alleviate residual hallucinations and delusions. Forty-nine patients were recruited into the trial, of whom 27 entered the trial and completed post-treatment assessment, and 23 were reassessed at six-month follow-up. Patients were randomly allocated to either coping strategy enhancement (CSE) or problem solving (PS). Half the patients were allocated to a high-expectancy positive demand condition and half to a counter-demand condition to evaluate expectation of improvement. Patients receiving either cognitive-behavioural treatment showed significant reductions in psychotic symptoms compared with those in the waiting period, who showed no improvement. There was some evidence, although equivocal, that patients receiving CSE improved more than those receiving PS. There was no evidence that improvements generalised to negative symptoms or social functioning, nor was there evidence that expectancy of treatment benefit contributed to the treatment effect.",0
"The aim of this study was to compare 2 self-help-based interventions; a coping-oriented approach, applied relaxation (AR) and an acceptance-oriented approach, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), for persons with chronic pain. This study is a randomized control trial (N=90) with a mixed between-within participants design with repeated measures. Interventions in both conditions comprised an initial face-to-face session, a 7-week manual-based self-help intervention including weekly therapist telephone support and a concluding face-to-face session. Outcome measures included satisfaction with life, depression, anxiety, acceptance of chronic pain, level of function, and pain intensity. Effects were measured at preintervention and postintervention and at 6 and 12 months after the end of intervention. The results show that the ACT condition increased their level of acceptance significantly compared with the AR condition. There was also a marginally significant interaction effect regarding satisfaction with life in which the ACT condition had improved in comparison to the AR condition. Further, the ACT condition reported a higher level of function and decreased pain intensity compared with the AR condition. Both conditions improved significantly regarding depression and anxiety. A manual-based self-help intervention with weekly therapist support in an ACT format adds value to the treatment repertoire for persons suffering with chronic pain.",1
"Why do people's impulse controls break down during emotional distress? Some theories propose that distress impairs one's motivation or one's ability to exert self-control, and some postulate self-destructive intentions arising from the moods. Contrary to those theories, Three experiments found that believing that one's bad mood was frozen (unchangeable) eliminated the tendency to eat fattening snacks (Experiment 1), seek immediate gratification (Experiment 2), and engage in frivolous procrastination (Experiment 3). The implication is that when people are upset, they indulge immediate impulses to make themselves feel better, which amounts to giving short-term affect regulation priority over other self-regulatory goals.",0
"This study evaluated a patient-treatment matching strategy intended to improve the effectiveness of hospital-inpatient and community-residential treatment for dual diagnosis patients. Matching variables were the severity of patient disorders and the program's service intensity. Each of three high-intensity hospital programs was paired with a nearby high-intensity community program; there were also four low-intensity pairs. Patients (N=230) were randomly assigned to hospital or community care at intake, and followed at discharge (96%) and at 4 months (90%). Support was found for the matching strategy at discharge in that severely ill patients treated in high-intensity programs improved more on substance abuse outcomes, and moderately ill patients treated in low-intensity programs improved more on psychiatric outcomes. The benefits of matching held at 4 months in that high-severity patients had better alcohol outcomes when they were treated in high-rather than low-intensity programs. High-and moderate-severity patients did not show differential outcomes in hospital-based or community-based programs. Dual diagnosis patients should be matched by symptom severity with program service intensity, but matching with hospital or community care may not enhance treatment outcomes.",0
"This randomized controlled trial investigated effects of Transcendental Meditation (TM) practice on Brain Integration Scale scores (broadband frontal coherence, power ratios, and preparatory brain responses), electrodermal habituation to 85-dB tones, sleepiness, heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and P300 latencies in 50 college students. After pretest, students were randomly assigned to learn TM immediately or learn after the 10-week posttest. There were no significant pretest group differences. A MANOVA of students with complete data (N=38) yielded significant group vs treatment interactions for Brain Integration Scale scores, sleepiness, and habituation rates (all p<.007). Post hoc analyses revealed significant increases in Brain Integration Scale scores for Immediate-start students but decreases in Delayed-start students; significant reductions in sleepiness in Immediate-start students with no change in Delayed-start students; and no changes in habituation rates in Immediate-start students, but significant increases in Delayed-start students. These data support the value of TM practice for college students.",0
"This paper is a report of a randomized control trial undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of the Brief Intervention for Alcohol Use in Taiwanese inpatients with hazardous drinking patterns. The Brief Intervention for Alcohol Use has been found to be as effective as medical and psychological treatments for individuals with alcohol use disorders in western countries. However, few studies have examined brief alcohol interventions for a Chinese population. Patients from the medical and surgical wards of a medical centre in northern Taiwan were enrolled if they had an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score >8. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 47), which received the Brief Intervention, and the control group (n = 48), which received no special psychosocial intervention except routine nursing care. Data were collected from February 2005 to March 2006 on hospitalized participants' demographic characteristics and alcohol use. Scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test were re-assessed over the telephone 6 months later by a trained assistant blinded to the treatment group. The experimental group had a significantly higher mean improved Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score and better outcomes in all three dimensions of the test than the control group. The Brief Intervention for Alcohol Use is recommended for use in clinical settings to help Taiwanese inpatients with hazardous drinking patterns to improve their drinking problems.",1
"Disulfiram is used to a great extent in Denmark to treat alcoholism but the evidence is limited. To study the effect of supervised disulfiram treatment in alcohol dependence. Subjects were recruited from a psychiatric emergency ward following alcohol withdrawal treatment. A total of n=39 patients were openly randomized to either disulfiram 800 mg twice a week for 26 weeks (n=19) or no disulfiram (n=20). All patients were also treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in groups. The rate of abstinence was 20% and 26% in the control and disulfiram group, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant (NS). A trend towards increased mean time to first drink was found in the disulfiram group (96 vs. 76 days in the control group, NS), while fewer patients in this group completed CBT group therapy (41% vs. 67% in the control group, NS). Alcohol-free days were 100 days in both groups (NS). Supervised disulfiram administration did not have any major impact on the treatment outcome.",0
"Comorbid depression is common in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, adversely affecting quality of life, diabetes outcomes, and mortality. Depression can be effectively treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The Internet is a new and attractive method for delivering CBT intervention on a large scale at relatively low costs. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Web-based CBT for depression treatment in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with minimal guidance. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands in 255 adult diabetic patients with elevated depressive symptoms. Primary outcomes were depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were diabetes-specific emotional distress and glycemic control. Assessments were at baseline, after treatment, and at the 1-month follow-up. The Web-based CBT was effective in reducing depressive symptoms by intention-to-treat analyses (P = 0.04, d = 0.29; clinical improvement 41% vs. 24% P < 0.001) and by per-protocol analyses (P < 0.001, d = 0.70; clinical improvement, 56% vs. 24% P < 0.001). The intervention reduced diabetes-specific emotional distress (P = 0.03) but had no beneficial effect on glycemic control (P > 0.05). Web-based CBT depression treatment is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, the intervention reduces diabetes-specific emotional distress in depressed patients.",0
"To examine the combined effect of age and timing of augmented feedback on learning muscle relaxation. Performing a gross motor task, subjects had to lower their trapezius muscle activity using the electromyographic signal as visual myofeedback. Healthy subjects (16 young adults: 20-35 yrs; and 16 older adults: 55-70 yrs) were randomly assigned to one of two timing conditions of myofeedback: concurrent (feedback was provided immediately during the trial) and terminal (feedback was provided delayed after the trial) condition. The results indicated that young adults had a higher level of motor performance (i.e., lower muscle activity) compared with older adults when myofeedback was provided. These effects persisted during short- (after 10 mins) and long-term retention (after 1 wk) when no myofeedback was provided. In contrast to young adults, older adults did not improve their performance throughout the experiment. There were no interactions of age with the timing conditions of myofeedback during acquisition and retention. Either timing condition of augmented feedback was equally helpful to young adults, whereas neither was helpful for older adults in learning muscle relaxation.",0
"This study evaluated the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment training (ACT) for increasing drug and alcohol counselors' willingness to use evidence-based agonist and antagonist pharmacotherapy. Fifty-nine drug and alcohol counselors were randomly assigned to either a 1-day ACT workshop or a 1-day educational control workshop. Both groups then attended a 2-day workshop on empirically supported treatments for substance abuse. Measures were taken at pre- and posttraining and 3-month follow-up on reported use of pharmacotherapy, willingness to use pharmacotherapy, perceived barriers to implementing new treatments, and general acceptance. As compared with those in the education alone condition, participants in the ACT condition showed significantly higher rates of referrals to pharmacotherapy at follow-up, rated barriers to learning new treatments as less believable at posttraining and follow-up, and showed greater psychological flexibility at posttraining and follow-up. Mediational analyses indicated that reduced believability of barriers and greater psychological flexibility mediated the impact of the intervention. Results support the idea that acceptance-based interventions may be helpful in addressing the psychological factors related to poor adoption of evidence-based treatments.",1
"Of a sample of 100 patients on an inpatient alcohol rehab unit, 50 were assigned to a weekly group therapy session in the aftercare clinic. Those inpatients with aftercare clinic exposure prior to discharge were more likely to return for aftercare. In a second study of 100 inpatients the effect of having a counselor who would continue to follow them in aftercare was explored. Half the sample had a counselor whose primary assignment was in the aftercare clinic and thus could work with them on a continuing basis. The other half had a counselor whose primary assignment was on the inpatient unit and would not be able to continue with them. Counselor continuity had no impact on aftercare follow through.",0
"This study aimed to compare the effects of music therapy with general recreational day activities in reducing agitation in people with dementia, residing in nursing home facilities. In a randomised controlled design, residents with dementia (n = 94) were allocated to either music therapy or recreational activities. Both music therapy and general activities were offered twice weekly for 4 months. Changes in agitation were measured with a modified Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) at four intervals on each intervention day. A mixed model analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of music therapy, compared with general activities, on CMAI scores at 4 h after the intervention, controlled for CMAI scores at 1 h before the session and session number. Data were analysed for 77 residents (43 randomised to music therapy and 34 to general activities). In both groups, the intervention resulted in a decrease in agitated behaviours from 1 h before to 4 h after each session. This decrease was somewhat greater in the music therapy group than in the general activities group, but this difference was statistically not significant (F = 2.885, p = 0.090) and disappeared completely after adjustment for Global Deterioration Scale stage (F = 1.500; p = 0.222). Both music therapy and recreational activities lead to a short-term decrease in agitation, but there was no additional beneficial effect of music therapy over general activities. More research is required to provide insight in the effects of music therapy in reducing agitation in demented older people.",0
"Residents in nursing homes (NHs) are often frail older persons who have impaired physical activity. Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common complaint for residents in NHs. Reduced functional ability and residence in NHs are documented to be risk factors for UI. To investigate if an individualized training program designed to improve activity of daily living (ADL) and physical capacity among residents in nursing homes has any impact on UI. This randomized controlled trial was a substudy of a Nordic multicenter study. Participants had to be >65 years, have stayed in the NH for more than 3 months and in need of assistance in at least one ADL. A total of 98 residents were randomly allocated to either a training group (n = 48) or a control group (n = 50) after baseline registrations. The training program lasted for 3 months and included accommodated physical activity and ADL training. Personal treatment goals were elicited for each subject. The control group received their usual care. The main outcome measure was UI as measured by a 24-hour pad-weighing test. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups on this measure at baseline (P = 0.15). Changes were calculated from baseline to 3 months after the end of the intervention. Altogether, 68 participants were included in the analysis, 35 in the intervention group and 33 in the control group. The average age was 84.3 years. The 3 months' postintervention adjusted mean difference between groups according to amount of leakage was 191 g (P = 0.03). This result was statistically significant after adjusting for baseline level, age, sex, and functional status. The leakage increased in residents not receiving the experimental intervention, while UI in the training group showed improvement. The intervention group had significant better results compared with the control group after an individualized training program designed to improve ADL and physical capacity. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of a goal-oriented physical training program toward NH residents UI complaints.",1
"Despite the demonstrated efficacy of psychosocial approaches to schizophrenia treatment that include a psychoeducational component, such as illness management, the implementation of these approaches into routine mental health treatment has been slow. The authors sought to examine the efficacy of a comprehensive, modularized, psychoeducational program called Team Solutions, which was designed to educate patients with major mental illnesses about their illness and how to manage it. Team Solutions was chosen for study because it is available over the Internet and other venues at no cost and is used by mental health agencies across the United States and Canada. Seventy-one persons with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from three day treatment settings participated in this randomized, single-blind study. Participants were randomly assigned to attend one of two interventions: the Team Solutions intervention, which consisted of participating in a 24-week psychoeducational group focused on illness management, or treatment as usual. For participants who attended the experimental group, significant improvement was observed in knowledge about schizophrenia. In addition, client satisfaction was high. However, no changes were observed in symptoms or functioning. Results indicated that participation in the Team Solutions psychoeducational group improved participants' knowledge. However, participation in the program did not demonstrate superiority over treatment as usual with respect to secondary and tertiary outcomes, such as symptom severity, treatment adherence, and global functioning.",0
"In a randomized trial the effects of occlusal appliance and relaxation therapy, each combined with brief information, were compared with brief information only, in adolescents with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain. One-hundred-and-twenty-two adolescents (93 F and 29 M aged 12-18 years) were randomly assigned to one of the following 3 groups: brief information + occlusal appliance (BI + OA), brief information + relaxation therapy (BI + RT), or brief information (BI). Included were subjects reporting pain once a week or more often, in addition to receiving a diagnosis of TMD according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD). They were evaluated before and after treatment and at a 6-month follow-up by means of self-reports and clinical assessment. The result revealed a significantly higher reduction in frequency of pain, in pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS]), and in a composite pain index (intensity x frequency) for patients treated with BI + OA compared with those treated with BI alone. In the BI + OA group, 60% of the patients attained a clinically significant improvement (at least 50% or more) on the pain index, a significantly higher proportion compared to that obtained in the other 2 treatment groups. Analgesic consumption was also significantly more reduced in the BI + OA group compared to the BI group. However, no significant differences were found between the treatment groups in jaw opening or in muscle and TMJ tenderness scores. Occlusal appliance was found to be superior to both relaxation therapy and brief information regarding pain reduction and can therefore be recommended when treating adolescents with TMD pain.",0
"To examine changes in motivation and the relationship of motivation to adherence to self-monitoring and weight loss in a 16-week Internet behavioral weight-loss intervention. Two-group randomized design. This study was conducted over the Internet. Sixty-six women, ages 22-65, with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40, and with a home computer with Internet access, participated. These data are from an Internet behavioral weight-loss program in which all participants received a face-to-face initial session followed by the 16-week Internet program. Adherence to self-monitoring and weight loss were the main outcome measures. Linear regression and mediation analysis using the Baron and Kenny method were conducted. Autonomous motivation increased initially and remained high for those who ultimately achieved a 5% weight loss, but declined over time for participants who did not achieve a 5% weight loss. Autonomous motivation at 4 weeks was a predictor of adherence to self-monitoring and 16-week weight loss. Adherence mediated the relationship between autonomous motivation and weight loss. These results suggest that autonomous motivation may be a promising intervention target for promoting program procedure adherence and weight loss.",1
"To test whether an expectancy challenge (EC) changes implicit and explicit alcohol-related cognitions and binge drinking in young heavy drinkers. This is important for theoretical and practical reasons: the EC presents a critical test for the hypothesized mediational role of alcohol cognitions and the EC has been presented as a promising intervention to counter alcohol problems in heavy drinking youth. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: Ninety-two heavy drinking college and university students (half women) were assigned randomly to the EC or control condition (a sham alcohol experiment in the same bar-laboratory). Explicit alcohol cognitions and alcohol use were assessed with paper-and-pencil measures. Alcohol use was assessed prior to the experiment and during a 1-month follow-up. Implicit alcohol-related cognitions were assessed with two versions of the Implicit Association Test (IAT), adapted to assess implicit valence and arousal associations with alcohol. The EC resulted in decreased explicit positive arousal expectancies in men and women alike. There was some evidence for a differential reduction in implicit arousal associations, but findings depended on the version of the IAT and on the scoring-algorithm used. In men (but not in women) there was a short-lived differential reduction in prospective alcohol use (significant in week 3 of the follow-up), and this reduction was partially mediated by the decrease in explicit positive arousal expectancies. These findings suggest that an EC successfully changes explicit alcohol cognitions and that this may have short-lived beneficial effects in heavy drinking young men.",1
"A recent study found that increases in insulin sensitivity following weight loss and stabilization were strongly related to subsequent weight regain. The present paper analyzed this relationship in two behavioral weight-loss programs. In the first study, 125 nondiabetic subjects were followed over 30 months; weight losses averaged 10 kg at six months, and subjects had regained 8 kg of their weight loss by their 30-month follow-up. Neither fasting insulin levels at six months nor changes in fasting insulin from zero to six months were related to subsequent weight regain. Similarly, insulin levels measured two hours after a 75 g glucose load were unrelated to subsequent weight regain. The second study followed 33 individuals with Type II diabetes, treated with behavior modification, and either a low calorie diet or a very low calorie diet. Weight losses averaged 18 kg at six months, and subjects had regained 10 kg by their 24-month follow-up. The Bergman minimal model was used to assess insulin sensitivity at 6-month intervals. Initial analyses suggested that changes in insulin sensitivity from zero to six months were related to subsequent weight regain, but this effect was strongly influenced by an outlier. After removing this individual, there were no significant relationships between the changes in insulin sensitivity that accompanied weight loss and future weight regain. Likewise, insulin sensitivity at 12 months did not predict weight regain from 12 to 24 months. These data do not support the hypothesis that increases in insulin sensitivity with weight loss are associated with subsequent weight regain.",0
"Research on treatments for reducing pathological worry is limited. In particular, academic worry is a common theme in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) samples as well as non-clinical student samples. Given the high cost of anxiety disorders to society, research is needed to examine the efficacy of self-administered treatments designed to reduce pathological worry. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the benefits of three self-administered interventions for reducing academic worry. College students (N = 113) experiencing clinically significant academic worry were randomized to either: (a) worry exposure (WE); (b) expressive writing (EW); (c) relaxation consisting of pulsed audio-photic stimulation (APS); or (d) waitlist control (WLC). Participants were instructed to practice their interventions three times per week for one month and completed home practice logs online to track treatment adherence. Academic worry, general anxiety, and perceived stress were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. Academic worry and general anxiety were also assessed at a three-month follow-up. Those assigned to the WE and APS conditions showed significant improvement relative to EW and WLC at post-treatment. All treatment conditions showed continued improvement by follow-up, with no between-group differences. Treatment and public health implications are discussed.",0
"Quality of life (QoL) is now seen as a key outcome in many aspects of dementia care. In a recent randomized controlled trial of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) groups, significant improvements in self-reported QoL were identified as well as changes in cognitive function. This further analysis of results from the trial examines whether the changes in these two domains occurred independently, perhaps for different reasons, or whether the effect of treatment on QoL was mediated by the changes in cognition. In all, 201 people with dementia living in residential homes or attending day centres were assessed using the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) scale and a range of measures of cognition, dementia level, mood, dependency and communication. Participants were randomized to receive an intervention programme of CST or to receive treatment as usual. The QoL-AD and other measures were repeated eight weeks later. At baseline, higher QoL in dementia was significantly correlated with lower levels of dependency and depression, but not with cognitive function or dementia severity. Improvement in quality of life was associated with being female, low quality of life at baseline, reduced depression and increased cognitive function. Changes in cognitive function mediated the effects of treatment in improving QoL. These results suggest that whilst QoL in dementia appears to be independent of level of cognitive function, interventions aimed at improving cognitive function can, nonetheless, have a direct effect on QoL.",0
