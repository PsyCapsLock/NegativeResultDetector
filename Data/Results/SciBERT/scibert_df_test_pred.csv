"BACKGROUND: To date, cultural clinical research has primarily focused on differences between ethnic groups when investigating causal beliefs about mental disorders. While individual as well as contextual factors are considered important for gaining a better understanding of cultural influences, research on causal beliefs about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cultural correlates in laypersons is scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at gain a better understanding of the association between causal beliefs about PTSD and cultural aspects, as well as other contextual and individual correlates of causal beliefs. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional, vignette-based online survey with 737 laypersons from Mexico, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, and Russia. Participants completed the illness perception questionnaire revised (IPQ-R) and reported several cultural and sociodemographic (e.g. country of residence, gender, personal values) as well as mental health-related variables (e.g. PTSD symptoms, previous seeking of help). Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of individuals expressing similar causal beliefs for PTSD. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse covariates of class membership. RESULTS: LCA resulted in a three-class solution of casual beliefs: a traumatic event-focused class (41.1%); an intrapersonal causes class (40.1%); and a multiple causes class (18.0%). Multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed country of residence, gender, personal value of security, PTSD symptoms, and mental health literacy as significant covariates of class membership. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating a more diverse concept of culture into cultural clinical research can be a valuable addition to group comparisons based on nationality or ethnicity. Cultural clinical research needs to move towards a more integrated approach that accounts for the complexity of culture. Including additional contextual and sociodemographic factors can help to reach a more accurate understanding of the cultural influences on the development of causal beliefs and mental health.",1.0,1
"Anticipating population ageing to reach a historically unprecedented level in this century and considering the public goal of promoting well-being until old age, research in many fields has started to focus on processes and factors that contribute to healthy ageing. Since human interactions have a tremendous impact on our mental and physical well-being, scientists are increasingly investigating the basic processes that enable successful social interactions such as social affect (empathy, compassion) and social cognition (Theory of Mind). However, regarding the replication crisis in psychological science it is crucial to probe the reproducibility of findings revealed by each specific method. To this end, we aimed to replicate the effect of age on empathy, compassion and Theory of Mind observed in Reiter and colleagues' study (Reiter et al. 2017 Sci. Rep. 7, 11046 (doi:10.1038/s41598-017-10669-4)) by using the same ecologically valid paradigm in an independent sample with similar age ranges. We were able to replicate the previously observed results of a preservation or even enhancement in socio-affective processes, but a decline in socio-cognitive processes for older adults. Our findings add to the understanding of how social affect and cognition change across the adult lifespan and may suggest targets for intervention studies aiming to foster successful social interactions and well-being until advanced old age.",1.0,1
"OBJECTIVE: Deficits in explicit learning and memory have consistently been reported in adult ADHD, but it is less clear whether these deficits reflect deficient attentional processes or specific dysfunctions in memory processes. Studies on implicit learning and memory, which are less dependent on the allocation of attention, have rarely been conducted on adult ADHD. METHOD: We implemented a modified serial reaction-time task that involves distracting stimuli to investigate implicit sequence learning in 32 adult participants with ADHD and in 32 matched healthy control participants. RESULTS: The participants with ADHD revealed unimpaired implicit learning performance, but they made significantly more errors than the control participants. There was no evidence for impaired error monitoring in the participants with ADHD reflected by a comparable degree of double errors and post-error slowing in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Reduced efficiency of the inhibition of incorrect responses in implicit sequence learning supports previous findings of impaired behavioral inhibition in adult ADHD.",0.0,0
"Abstract Background Previous laboratory findings suggest deviant gait characteristics in depressed individuals (i.e., reduced walking speed and vertical up-and-down movements, larger lateral swaying movements, slumped posture). However, since most studies to date assessed gait in the laboratory, it is largely an open question whether this association also holds in more naturalistic, everyday life settings. Thus, within the current study we (1) aimed at replicating these results in an everyday life and (2) investigated whether gait characteristics could predict change in current mood. Methods We recruited a sample of patients (n = 35) suffering from major depressive disorder and a sample of age and gender matched non-depressed controls (n = 36). During a 2-day assessment we continuously recorded gait patterns, general movement intensity and repetitively assessed the participant’s current mood. Results We replicated previous laboratory results and found that patients as compared to non-depressed controls showed reduced walking speed and reduced vertical up-and-down movements, as well as a slumped posture during everyday life episodes of walking. Moreover, independent of clinical diagnoses, higher walking speed, and more vertical up-and-down movements significantly predicted more subsequent positive mood, while changes in mood did not predict subsequent changes in gait patterns. Conclusion In sum, our results support expectations that embodiment (i.e., the relationship between bodily expression of emotion and emotion processing itself) in depression is also observable in naturalistic settings, and that depression is bodily manifested in the way people walk. The data further suggest that motor displays affect mood in everyday life.",0.0,0
"Suppressing unwanted memories can impair their later recall. Recent work shows that this forgetting is achieved by at least two mechanisms supported by distinct neural systems: thought substitution and direct suppression (Benoit & Anderson, 2012). Here, we examined whether direct suppression, thought to be achieved by down-regulation of hippocampal activity, can disrupt memory of aversive scenes, and, if so, whether this disruption is linked to people's perception of their ability to control intrusive thoughts. We presented participants with strong naturalistic reminders to aversive scenes and asked them to either covertly retrieve or directly suppress the associated scenes. Later, participants were cued with the reminders and asked to recall the scenes in detail. Direct suppression reduced recall probability of the scenes and also reduced the number of details recalled, even when scenes were remembered. Deficits in recall arose for minor details but also for details central to each scene's gist. Participants with higher self-perceived control abilities over intrusive thoughts showed greater forgetting than did those reporting lower levels of control. These findings suggest that inhibitory processes underlying direct suppression can disrupt retention of aversive visual memories and link those processes to individual differences in control over intrusive thoughts in everyday life. These findings reinforce the possibility that inhibition may be less efficient in people likely to acquire posttraumatic stress disorder in the wake of a traumatic experience.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Patients with depression tend to process negative information with regard to the self (i.e. self-referential processing). A better understanding of the neural underpinnings of self-referential processing in patients with depression is clinically important as it can inform on potential treatment targets. METHOD: This fMRI study sought to study the neural correlates of self-referential processing in patients with chronic major depressive disorder (cMDD) (n=17) and non-patient controls (n=18) using a passive processing paradigm. Stimuli consisted of positive, negative, negative depression related and neutral personality trait words or non-words. Participants were instructed to indicate whether a presented word was an existing word or a non-word while undergoing an fMRI scan. Participants also completed an explicit and an implicit measure of positive and negative self-associations outside the scanner. RESULTS: Non-patient controls had relatively increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during processing of negative depression related vs. neutral words whereas patients with cMDD had relatively decreased activity. Non-patient controls had relatively increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity during processing of positive vs. neutral words whereas patients with cMDD had relatively decreased activity. Explicit but not implicit self-associations with depression related words were associated with neural activity in the mPFC and the dlPFC. LIMITATIONS: The study did not include a clinical control group and therefore the specificity of findings remains unknown. CONCLUSIONS: The distinct neural processing of emotional self-relevant stimuli in the mPFC and the dlPFC in patients with cMDD might represent an emotional blunting response towards negative self-relevant stimuli.",0.0,0
"Errors are aversive, motivationally-salient events which prime defensive action. This is reflected in a potentiated startle reflex after the commission of an error. The current study replicates and extends previous work examining the time course of error-potentiated startle as a function of startle lag (i.e., 300 ms or 800 ms following correct and error responses). In addition, the relationship between error-potentiated startle and error-related brain activity in both the temporal (error-related negativity, ERN/Ne) and spectral (error-related theta and delta power) domains was investigated. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 32 healthy undergraduates while they performed an arrowhead version of a flanker task. Complex Morlet wavelets were applied to compute oscillatory power in the delta- and theta-band range. Consistent with our previous report, startle was larger following errors. Furthermore, this effect was evident at both early and late startle probe times. Increased delta and theta power after an error was associated with larger error-potentiated startle. An association between ERN amplitude and error-potentiated startle was only observed in a subgroup of individuals with relatively large ERN/Ne amplitude. Among these individuals, ERN/Ne magnitude was also related to multiple indices of task performance. This study further supports the notion that errors are aversive events that prime defensive motivation, and that error-potentiated startle is evident beyond the immediate commission of an error and can be predicted from error-related brain activity.",1.0,1
"Olfaction moderates human sexual experiences and smell disorder patients sometimes spontaneously complain about impairments in their sexual life. The aim of the present study was to systematically investigate the impact of olfactory dysfunction on sexual desire. We compared a sample of n = 100 (n = 52 women; aged 23-51 years, M = 40.1, SD = 8.2) outpatients with olfactory disorders to a sample of n = 51 healthy controls (n = 32 women; aged 21-63 years, M = 39.2, SD = 13.1). Sexual desire was assessed with a standardized questionnaire and with two additional items asking for quantitative and qualitative change of sexual desire since the onset of olfactory loss. In addition, subjects completed questionnaires about mood and partnership attachment. Within the patients' group, 29% of the subjects reported decreased sexual desire since the onset of olfactory loss. This change was predicted by depressive symptoms and olfactory function. Qualitative reports revealed for instance that the lack of attraction due to the other's body odor impedes partnership intimacy. The change of sexual desire was significantly related to depression and severity of olfactory impairment but not to partnership attachment. However, in the standardized questionnaire about sexual desire we observed no differences between patients and controls. To sum up, a considerable number of patients state sexual impairment as a concomitant complaint of olfactory dysfunction. Patients do typically not spontaneously report those intimate problems, routine care settings should inform about this common side effect and explicitly ask for sexual life.",1.0,0
"Abstract Background Strong feelings of disgust and anxiety are maintaining factors in contamination-related obsessive–compulsive disorder (C-OCD). To this day there are not many studies that investigated strategies for changing pathological disgust. In a previous study, it was shown that imagery rescripting could successfully change disgust. However, whether imagery rescripting or more general imagery processing, helps to reduce pathological disgust, remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate how successful imagery rescripting is in comparison to imagery self-compassion and a passive positive imagery condition in reducing disgust. Methods For this, the three strategies were compared to each other on 2 days (within-subject) in a laboratory experiment. The study included 24 subjects with diagnosed C-OCD, and 24 matched, healthy controls (between-subject). Results The results show that all three strategies changed disgust, they do not differ from each other and that different traits appear to influence the strategies’ success or failure. The theoretically derived underlying mechanisms of the strategies were found in an elaborate content analysis. Conclusions The present study provides first indications that imagery in general can help to change pathological disgust experience.",0.0,0
"The present eye-tracking study investigates whether individuals with different levels of contamination fear are more likely to focus their attention on disgusting stimuli to explore them or to pull their attention away to avoid them. Ninety-two nonclinical participants with varying degrees of contamination fear performed a dot probe task. Eye-tracking methodology was employed to record gaze patterns during the task. In each trial participants looked at two pictures (disgust-neutral, fear-neutral, or neutral-neutral). Participants were further asked about the contents of the picture and the confidence of their answer. The results show that reaction times were slower and fixations were longer and more frequent for disgust targets compared with fear and neutral targets, which was further amplified in individuals with high contamination fear. However, image details of disgusting pictures were remembered less correctly than details of fearful pictures. These findings confirm the idea that attention on disgusting stimuli is maintained. Further, the findings indicate that disgust is processed more superficially and might also be related to disgust-associated uncertainty and ambiguity. The results may help to understand the difficult-to-change nature of disgust, which could be relevant to habituation and extinction processes in exposure therapy.

"Abstract Given the large discrepancy between prevalence rates of mental disorders in adolescents and actual treatment rates, there is a need to understand what prevents this age group from seeking psychotherapy. We assessed the barriers to seeking psychotherapy in this age group, including their attitudes toward people with a mental disorder, using a convergent parallel mixed-methods design. Participants were 288 adolescents aged 12–21 years ( M = 16.8 years, SD = 2.3; 37% identified as male, 63% as female, and 0% as nonbinary). Qualitative data were obtained with open-ended questions on barriers to initiating psychotherapy and attitudes toward people with a mental disorder. Barriers to seeking psychotherapy and information about psychotherapy were assessed with a questionnaire using a quantitative design. The qualitative assessment revealed as the main barriers fear of a negative interaction with a psychotherapist, fear of being confronted with their own emotions, self-stigma, and fear of public stigma. Further, lack of accessibility, lack of trust in the therapist, a desire for social distance from, and a negative attitude toward people with a mental disorder were associated with a decreased intention to initiate psychotherapy. Previous positive experience with a psychotherapist was a facilitator of seeking psychotherapy. We found gender differences, with higher desire for social distance and higher optimism bias scores as well as poorer mental health knowledge for participants identifying as male. Integrating results from both approaches results in further information for the improvement of prevention programs and interventions to lower barriers to seeking psychotherapy. Gender differences indicate a need for gender-role-specific interventions.",1.0,1
"OBJECTIVE: Periodontal disease is associated with a wide range of psychosocial risk-factors. Disease-related tooth-loss has been associated with an increase in depressive symptoms in cross-sectional studies. However, while depression is a known risk-factor for the outcome of chronic diseases, it remains unclear if tooth loss can also predict depressive symptoms over the course of treatment. Aim of the current pilot study was to test, to what extend the number of teeth predict depressive symptoms several years later. METHODS: Tooth status of 310 patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis was evaluated at the beginning of a specialized, university based outpatient treatment. We assessed depressive symptoms with the Patient Heath Questionnaire (PHQ) on average 13years later. Regression analyses were used to relate initial number of teeth to self-reported depression scores. RESULTS: Fewer teeth at the beginning of the treatment were related to higher scores of depressive symptoms, even when controlling for several covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Tooth loss is a potential risk-factor for the development of depression in periodontal disease. Further longitudinal studies that control for initial depressive symptoms are needed to identify disease mechanisms.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Many orphans in East Africa are living in institutional care facilities where they experience poor quality of care and ongoing maltreatment. We report on the extension of a cluster-randomized controlled trial aiming to replicate and show sustainability of previous found effects and to discover long-term effects of the intervention Interaction Competencies with Children-for Caregivers (ICC-C) 12-months after the intervention's conclusion. METHODS: Conducting a robust 2x3 analysis of variance, we investigated the changes over time in the waitlist orphanages (n = 75, 62.7% female, Mage = 37.63 years, SDage = 11.81), which participated in the intervention after first follow-up and in the initial intervention orphanages (n = 81, 61.7% female, Mage = 38.73 years, SDage = 11.94). RESULTS: The caregivers in the waitlist orphanages reported less reported levels of maltreatment (d = -0.09), fewer positive attitudes towards violent discipline (d = -0.44) and increased childcare knowledge (d = 1.26) three months after intervention, replicating our findings of the initial intervention condition. In addition, these effects were maintained in the intervention orphanages 12 months post intervention. Furthermore, we found long-term improvements in negative caregiver-child relationship (d = -0.83), caregivers' stress level (d = -0.98) and their mental health problems (d = -0.61). CONCLUSIONS: The replication and maintenance of the intervention effects and first hints to additional long-term effects substantiates the effectiveness of ICC-C. As long as alternative care cannot be provided for all children in need, brief caregiver trainings can make an important contribution to enlarge the opportunities for many children.

"The QLiS (Quality of Life in Schizophrenia) is a disease-specific questionnaire with high content validity and sound psychometric properties. It comprises 54 items related to 12 subscales. However, its use in surveys or clinical studies is limited due to its length. Our aim was to develop and validate a short form of the QLiS. Four steps were taken to develop the short form (QLiS-SF) using samples from the Clinical Analysis of the Treatment of Schizophrenia study. 1. A model with second order scales was developed using exploratory factor analysis. 2. The resulting model was tested in an independent sample using confirmative factor analysis (CFA). 3. Based on this model, items were selected on grounds of distributional properties, content reviews, and item loadings. 4. The resulting short form was validated independently through CFA. Results Three second order scales were constructed: illness-related quality of life, social life, and global subjective well-being. CFA of the new theoretical model resulted in a CFI of 0.67 and absolute fit indices of CMIN/df = 2.55, RMSEA = 0.08, SRMR = 0.09. We selected 13 items that showed good statistical properties and good fit of content to subscale. Fit of the underlying theoretical model with the 13 items was satisfactory (CFI = 0.95, CMIN/df = 2.23, RMSEA = 0.06, SRMR = 0.04). Composite reliability scores for the three subscales were above 0.70. The QLiS-SF showed adequate model fit and reliability. It offers a novel, well-founded opportunity to assess quality of life in persons with schizophrenia in situations in which the application of the long version is not considered possible.

"Individual differences in general cognitive ability (i.e., intelligence) have been linked to individual variations in the modular organization of functional brain networks. However, these analyses have been limited to static (time-averaged) connectivity, and have not yet addressed whether dynamic changes in the configuration of brain networks relate to general intelligence. Here, we used multiband functional MRI resting-state data (N = 281) and estimated subject-specific time-varying functional connectivity networks. Modularity optimization was applied to determine individual time-variant module partitions and to assess fluctuations in modularity across time. We show that higher intelligence, indexed by an established composite measure, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), is associated with higher temporal stability (lower temporal variability) of brain network modularity. Post-hoc analyses reveal that subjects with higher intelligence scores engage in fewer periods of extremely high modularity - which are characterized by greater disconnection of task-positive from task-negative networks. Further, we show that brain regions of the dorsal attention network contribute most to the observed effect. In sum, our study suggests that investigating the temporal dynamics of functional brain network topology contributes to our understanding of the neural bases of general cognitive abilities.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: In the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), combatants are exposed to massive forms of violence and other traumatic stressors. Nevertheless, many combatants do not suffer from trauma-related disorders, although they have experienced numerous traumatizing events. Perceiving aggressive behavior as fascinating and arousing might be a defense against trauma-related disorders in the violent environment of war and conflict. OBJECTIVE: Thus, in this study we investigated the relationship between the exposure to traumatic stressors, appetitive aggression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity. We hypothesized that cumulative traumatic experiences correlated positively and appetitive aggression negatively with PTSD symptom severity. METHOD: In total, 105 voluntary male combatants from different armed groups in the eastern DRC took part in this study. In a semistructured interview, respondents were questioned about their exposure to traumatic stressors, the extent of appetitive aggression (Appetitive Aggression Scale) and their PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Symptom Scale - Interview). RESULTS: A multiple sequential regression analysis showed that traumatic events were positively related to PTSD symptom severity. For participants with low to medium PTSD symptom severity, appetitive aggression correlated negatively with PTSD symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide further support for earlier findings that repeated exposure to traumatic stressors cumulatively heightens the risk of PTSD and revealed that appetitive aggression buffers the risk of developing PTSD symptoms under certain circumstances. Thus, the perception of aggressive behavior as fascinating and arousing seem to help combatants to adapt to violent environments but may also be one reason for recurrent failure of reintegration programs for excombatants.",1.0,1
"Violent forms of discipline in schools continue to be widespread across the globe despite their damaging effects. Since little is known about factors influencing the extent of violence applied by teachers, this study aimed to investigate the influence of teachers' stress, work satisfaction, and personal characteristics on their disciplining style. Using structural equation modeling, associations between violent discipline, burnout symptoms, and job perceptions (pressure and difficulties in class) reported by 222 teachers from 11 secondary schools in Tanzania in 2015 were analyzed. Results indicated a direct association between perceived stress and emotional violent discipline (beta=.18, p<.05) as well as physical violent discipline (beta=.37, p<.001). Perceived stress also mediated the association between job perceptions and both forms of violent disciplining. The model showed good model fit (chi(2) [44, n=222]=67.47 (p=.013), CFI=.94, TLI=.91, IFI=.94, RMSEA=.049 [90%-CI=.02-.07, PCLOSE=.50], SRMR=.06). Our findings suggest that teachers' personal perceptions of their work as well as their stress burden play a role in their disciplining styles. Our findings underline the importance of integrating topics, such as stress and coping as well as positive, nonviolent discipline measures into the regular teacher's training and in addition to develop and evaluate school-based preventative interventions for teachers.",1.0,1
"Young children with a history of maltreatment or neglect in foster families often confront their caregivers with particularly challenging behaviors. This may lead to more parenting stress, an increased risk for the child in foster care to experience further maltreatment, and placement disruptions. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a parent group training tailored to the special needs of foster families. We hypothesized significant short- and long-term improvements regarding foster parents' parenting competencies, child mental health problems, and related outcomes. Eighty-one families with 87 children in foster care aged 2 to 7 years participated in the trial. For the intervention study, 44 randomly selected families (54%) were offered to participate in the parent group training. Intervention and control group families were reassessed three times over a period of 1 year. Contrary to our expectations, we found no advantages of the intervention group compared with the usual care control group on any outcome measure. Instead, we found some significant changes in both groups across time. Placement into foster care is associated with some favorable outcomes for children in foster care. Additional support for foster families beyond the services delivered in the youth welfare system to foster parents was not associated with more favorable outcomes. The present intervention is likely associated with a low risk of harm but also with a high likelihood of a lack of significant benefits for foster parents and their young children going beyond feeling satisfied about the delivered services. Participating foster families showed favorable baseline results on parenting measures which may have impeded intervention effects to unfold on these proximal variables.",0.0,0
"Background: During the corona pandemic increased rates of embitterment have been found in the general population. As embitterment occurs reactive to triggers related to experienced negative events, and as people were steadily exposed to pandemic-related information, the research question arises: Can embitterment be triggered by pandemic-related information in form of infection rates displayed in figures? Method: Within an experimental design we investigated whether a figure presenting infection rates in an aggravated manner (seemingly strong infection increase and then stable course, experimental group, EG, n=138) leads to stronger embitterment increase, as compared to a figure presenting infection rates seemingly stable (control group, CG, n=155). Accompanying characteristics with potential influence on embitterment have been assessed: wisdom, general belief in a just world, perceived injustice events during the pandemic. Results: In contrast to the experimental hypothesis, the EG decreased in embitterment after reading the aggravated infection rates figure, whereas the CG rested stable. People with higher wisdom scores had a lower embitterment level after watching the infection data. There was no association between perceived pandemic-related injustice events and embitterment after watching the infection data. Belief in a just world slightly decreased over the course in both groups. Discussion: By means of pandemic-related data presentation, embitterment affect can be changed. Contradictory to expectation, the aggravated presentation led to a reduction of embitterment. This example shows that even simple but specific information presentations can induce changes in state affect, and this happens independently from other relevant characteristics (such as perceived injustice events during pandemic, or general belief in a just world). Professionals who present event-related data in public should explain these data and be aware that information and data presentation may relevantly impact on peoples affects.",0.0,0
"Between-group comparisons are permissible and meaningfully interpretable only if diagnostic instruments are proved to measure the same latent dimensions across different groups. Addressing this issue, the present study was carried out to provide a rigorous test of measurement invariance. Confirmatory factor analyses were used to determine which model solution could best explain memory performance as measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale-Fourth Edition (WMS-IV) in a clinical depression sample and in healthy controls. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate the evidence for measurement invariance. A three-factor model solution including the dimensions of auditory memory, visual memory, and visual working memory was identified to best fit the data in both samples, and measurement invariance was partially satisfied. The results supported clinical utility of the WMS-IV--that is, auditory and visual memory performances of patients with depressive disorders are interpretable on the basis of the WMS-IV standardization data. However, possible differences in visual working memory functions between healthy and depressed individuals could restrict comparisons of the WMS-IV working memory index.",0.0,1
"Explanatory models ascribe to arousability a central role for the development of psychotic symptoms. Thus, a disposition to hyperarousal (i.e., increased arousal predisposition (AP)) may serve as an underlying vulnerability indicator for psychosis by interacting with stressors to cause symptoms. In this case, AP, stress-response, and psychotic symptoms should be linked before the development of a diagnosable psychotic disorder. We conducted a cross-sectional online study in a population sample (N = 104; M age = 27.7 years, SD = 11.2, range 18-70). Participants rated their AP and subclinical psychotic symptoms. Participants reported their stress-levels before and after two stress inductions including an arithmetic and a social stressor. The participants with an increased AP generally felt more stressed. However, AP was not associated with the specific stress-response. As expected, positive psychotic symptoms were significantly associated with AP, but this was not mediated by general stress-levels. Its association to subtle, nonclinical psychotic symptoms supports our assumption that AP could be a vulnerability indicator for psychosis. The trait is easily accessible via a short self-report and could facilitate the identification of people at risk and be a promising target for early stress-management. Further research is needed to clarify its predictive value for stress-responses.",0.0,0
"In adults, sleep selectively consolidates those memories that are relevant for future events. The present study tested whether napping after encoding plays a role in selective memory consolidation in infants. Infants aged 15 and 24 months (n = 48 per age) were randomly assigned to a nap or a no-nap demonstration condition, or a baseline control condition. In the demonstration conditions, infants observed an experimenter perform an irrelevant action followed by a relevant action to achieve a desirable outcome on four different toys. Infant imitation of irrelevant and relevant actions was coded at a test session that occurred after a 24-hr delay. The demonstration and test sessions were scheduled around infants' naturally occurring sleeping patterns. When order of actions was not taken into account, infants in both demonstration conditions exhibited retention of the relevant and irrelevant target actions. Contrary to expectations, infants in the nap condition did not perform the relevant action only more often than infants in the no-nap condition. As expected, only infants in the no-nap condition faithfully reproduced the two actions in the demonstrated order: irrelevant action first, followed by the relevant action. Thus, sleep might help infants to selectively ""discard"" aspects of a learning experience that they identify as being not useful or relevant in the future.",0.0,0
"Cyberbullying has regularly been shown to be associated with suicide ideation/behavior. The present study investigated whether positive mental health, i.e., high levels of emotional, cognitive and psychological well-being, buffers the association between cyberbullying and suicide ideation/behavior. A total of 225 students completed measures of cyberbullying, suicide ideation/behavior, and positive mental health. Positive mental health fully mediated the association between cyberbullying and suicide ideation/behavior. Positive mental health seems to confer resilience and should be taken into account in clinical and preventive programs for student populations.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with high rates of chronicity and relapse risk is a considerable therapeutic challenge in the disorder. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of stages of change and outcome with a focus on the relapse struggle in the maintenance stage in patients with predominantly chronic AN. Further, therapeutic alliance and stages of change associations were explored. METHODS: As an instrument measuring relapse struggle in the maintenance stage, we applied the short form of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment-Short (URICA-S). We assessed stages of change in 39 patients with a predominantly chronic course of AN in early, middle, and late stages of inpatient psychotherapy. General symptom severity as assessed by the SCL-90-R and weight change were investigated as outcome measures. RESULTS: In-line with earlier evidence, contemplation significantly predicted therapeutic alliance. Further, we demonstrated that relapse risk as operationalized by URICA-S maintenance is an important predictor of general psychopathology. BMI change was not predicted by stages of change. CONCLUSIONS: The URICA-S maintenance scale might be applied to help identify patients at relapse risk. High URICA-S maintenance scores could be considered as one critical aspect of AN patients who might especially benefit from relapse-preventing aftercare programs.",0.0,0
"AIM: real-time monitoring of psychotherapeutic processes was recently described as a promising, new way of tracking periods of change in ongoing treatments. This approach generates complex, multivariate datasets that have to be presented in an intuitive way for clinicians to aid their clinical decision-making. Using network modeling and new approaches in centrality analyses, we examine ""bridge nodes"" between symptom stress and aspects of the psychotherapeutic process between therapy session (intersession processes, ISP). Method:we recorded intersession processes as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms using daily questionnaires in ten cases. Regularized, thresholded intraindividual dynamic networks were estimated. We applied bridge centrality analysis to identify individual bridges between psychotherapeutic processes and symptoms in the resulting models. Case-wise interpretations of bridge centrality values are offered. RESULTS: bridge centrality analysis revealed individual bridge nodes between intersession processes and symptom severity. Strength and direction of bridges varied substantially across individuals. CONCLUSION: given current methodological challenges, idiographic network studies are feasible and offer important insights for psychotherapy process research. In this case, we demonstrated how patients deal with periods of increased symptom stress. In this case we have described how patients deal with their therapy under increased symptom load. Bridges between psychotherapeutic processes and symptom stress are a promising target for monitoring systems based on ISP. Future studies should examine the clinical utility of network-based monitoring and feedback in ongoing therapies. In the near future, process feedback systems based on idiographic models could serve clinicians to improve treatments.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Whereas the majority of bereaved persons recover from their grief without professional assistance, a minority develops pathological grief reactions. Etiological models postulate that dysfunctional cognitions may perpetuate such reactions. The Grief Cognitions Questionnaire (GCQ) assesses thoughts after bereavement in nine interrelated domains. A short form (GCQ-SF) with four domains is often used. However, an evaluation of the psychometric properties of the GCQ-SF and its utility compared to the GCQ is lacking and these instruments have not been validated in German. METHOD: German bereaved persons (time since loss 35.3 +/- 34.6 months) responded to an online survey containing the GCQ, measures of grief severity, grief rumination, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and optimism and pessimism. 585 participants (18-78 years, 88% women) were included. Item analyses and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Correlations between the GCQ and GCQ-SF and grief rumination, optimism and pessimism assessed construct validity. Criterion-related validity was assessed by comparing whether the correlation of the GCQ (and the GCQ-SF) with grief severity was higher than with anxious and depressive symptoms. Logistic regression and receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) compared the questionnaires on their ability to predict probable prolonged grief 'caseness' (ICG >/= 25, time since loss >/=6 months). RESULTS: Internal consistencies for both questionnaires were identical and excellent (alpha = 0.96). Confirmatory factor analyses obtained a satisfactory fit for models with nine and four correlated subscales and respective higher-order factor models. The GCQ and the GCQ-SF correlated higher with grief severity than with other measures of psychopathology. The logistic regression showed a significant association between the GCQ-SF and prolonged grief 'caseness'. Of the remaining subscales of the GCQ, only one subscale ('Others') contributed to the prediction. The ROC analyses showed nearly identical areas under the curve. CONCLUSION: The translated GCQ and GCQ-SF demonstrated very good psychometric properties. The correlations with grief severity highlight the questionnaires' clinical relevance. The questionnaires possessed identical diagnostic specificity and sensitivity. Whenever a timesaving assessment of the most typical grief-specific cognitions is important, the GCQ-SF represents an alternative to the GCQ. The original GCQ may still be superior when a more detailed description of a bereaved person's cognitions is desirable.",0.0,1
"BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of patients with affective and psychotic disorders show a marked reduction in goal-directed behaviour, which is also reflected in the behavioural outcomes of effort-based decision-making paradigms. The factors underlying this reduction are not yet fully understood. Reward salience and reward expectancy have been discussed as factors that potentially influence approach behaviour. The aim of this study was thus to test their effects on behaviour in an effort-based decision-making paradigm. METHODS: In two studies with community samples we applied a modified version of the Balloon Task. In study 1, we manipulated reward salience in a within-subject design (N = 32) by highlighting the monetary rewards. In study 2, we manipulated reward expectancy in a between-subject design (N = 72) by adding five practice trials with either positive or negative feedback prior to the task. RESULTS: The salience of rewards manipulation significantly increased effort expenditure and the allocation of effort to the level of rewards whereas the reward expectancy manipulation did not. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that increasing the salience of rewards increases motivated behaviour in an effort-based decision-making paradigm offers promising possibilities for intervention in disorders characterised by motivational deficits, such asaffective and psychotic disorders.",0.0,0
"The exact causes of Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance Attributed to Electromagnetic Fields (IEI-EMF, i.e., experience of somatic symptoms attributed to low-level electromagnetic fields) are still unknown. Psychological causation such as nocebo effects seem plausible. This study aimed to experimentally induce a nocebo effect for somatic symptom perception and examined whether it was reproducible after one week. We also examined whether these effects were associated with increased sympathetic activity and whether interoceptive accuracy (IAcc) moderated these relationships. Participants were recruited from the general population and instructed that electromagnetic exposure can enhance somatosensory perception. They participated twice in a cued exposure experiment with tactile stimulation and sham WiFi exposure in 50% of trials. The two sessions were scheduled one week apart (session 1: N = 65, session 2: N = 63). Before session 1, participants watched either a 6-min film on adverse health effects of EMF or a neutral film on trade of mobile phones. IAcc was assessed with the heartbeat detection paradigm. Electrodermal activity served as a measure of sympathetic activation. Evidence for a nocebo effect (i.e., increased self-reported intensity and aversiveness and electrodermal activity) during sham WiFi exposure was observed in both sessions. IAcc moderated the nocebo effect, depending on stimulus intensity. Contrary to previous findings, no difference emerged between the health-related EMF and the neutral films. Based on negative instructions, somatic perception and physiological responding can be altered. This is consistent with the assumption that IEI-EMF could be due to nocebo effects, suggesting an important role for psychological interventions.",0.0,0
"Attention to sexual stimuli is a prerequisite to process such stimuli as sexually-meaningful and is an important means to facilitate sexual arousal. Attending to sexual cues is crucial for healthy sexual functioning. Studies suggest that sexual dysfunction is associated with less attention towards sexual stimuli. The goal of this study was to use an eye-tracking-based free-viewing paradigm to investigate whether women with sexual dysfunction visually attend to the genital area in dynamic sexual stimuli (i.e., erotic videos) differently than women with subclinical sexual function or those with typical sexual functioning. A total of 69 women (M(age) = 27.77, SD = 8.00) with clinical (n = 30), subclinical (n = 23), and typical (n = 16) levels of sexual functioning watched four 1-min video clips depicting heterosexual couples engaging in vaginal intercourse or cunnilingus while the total fixation duration on the genital area as well as their subjective and genital sexual arousal were recorded. As hypothesized, the clinical group fixated on the genital area less than women with typical sexual functioning. A longer total fixation duration on the genital area was followed by increases in subjective arousal and genital arousal. The relationship between attention and arousal was not moderated by sexual functioning group. This study provides first evidence of the role of sustained visual attention for facilitating sexual arousal in women with and without sexual dysfunction.",1.0,0
"To perform repeated measurements in clinical practice without putting unnecessary strain on patients, short instruments are needed. The Brief Self-Report Measure of Agitation (BAM) is a short measure assessing agitation, which has been associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. However, its reliability and validity have not been examined in an independent sample. A non-clinical sample of N = 429 participants aged between 18-81 (M = 27.36, SD = 9.67; 82.3% female) was surveyed online. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted and reliability was investigated. The validity of the BAM was examined by calculating correlations and an ANOVA for differences in BAM scores between subgroups. BAM items significantly loaded onto one factor (factor loadings: >/= .62) and the measure was found to have good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .83) and convergent/discriminant validity. Participants with recent suicidal ideation and those with recent suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts had significantly higher BAM scores than participants without suicidal ideation/suicide attempt. Results indicate good validity and reliability for the measurement of agitation with the German version of the BAM in the present sample. Thereby, we introduce a brief instrument in German for repeated assessment of agitation in research and clinical practice.",1.0,1
"INTRODUCTION: Dysfunctional appraisals about traumatic events and their sequelae are a key mechanism in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Experimental studies have shown that a computerized cognitive training, cognitive bias modification for appraisals (CBM-APP), can modify dysfunctional appraisals and reduce analogue trauma symptoms amongst healthy and subclinical volunteers. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test whether CBM-APP could reduce dysfunctional appraisals related to trauma reactions in PTSD patients, and whether this would lead to improvements in PTSD symptoms. METHODS: We compared CBM-APP to sham training in a parallel-arm proof-of-principle double-blind randomized controlled trial amongst 80 PTSD patients admitted to an inpatient clinic. Both arms comprised a training schedule of 8 sessions over a 2-week period and were completed as an adjunct to the standard treatment programme. RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses, participants receiving CBM-APP showed a greater reduction in dysfunctional appraisals on a scenario task from pre- to posttraining (primary outcome) assessments, compared to those receiving sham training (d = 1.30, 95% CI 0.82-1.80), with between-group differences also found on the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI; d = 0.85, 95% CI 0.39-1.32) and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; d = 0.68, 95% CI 0.23-1.14), but not for long-term cortisol concentrations (d = 0.25, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.78). Reductions in dysfunctional appraisals assessed via the scenario task correlated with reductions on the PTCI, PCL-5, and hair cortisol concentrations from pre- to posttraining time points. CONCLUSIONS: Results support dysfunctional appraisals as a modifiable cognitive mechanism, and that their proximal modification transfers to downstream PTSD symptoms. These findings could open new avenues for improving present therapeutic approaches.",0.0,0
"The objective was a psychometric examination of a German translation of the Children's Somatization Inventory (CSI) and its parents' version (P-CSI) and a replication of the item selection process of Walker et al. in J Pediatr Psychol 34:430-440 [5] for their revised version to create shorter German versions. Based on a school sample of 1,539 parents and 731 children, we explored the psychometric properties and dimensionality of the original and a shortened revised version. A clinical sample of 70 parental reports served as an additional sample. Walker et al.'s item selection could be largely replicated. Dimensionality differed between samples and versions (original vs. revised), but original DSM-III symptom clusters could mostly be identified. Symptom intensity was associated with age and mental health. Internal consistency, test-retest- and inter-rater reliability were good. Both German versions, the CSI and the P-CSI can be regarded as a useful screening instrument for somatic complaints in children.",1.0,1
"Bullying victimization is associated with adverse mental health consequences, while bullies suffer few or no adverse consequences in Western societies. Yet the universality of these consequences across western and eastern cultures is unknown. The current study investigated retrospective bullying experience in primary and secondary schools and its effects on adult mental health (depression, anxiety, stress, lifetime suicidal behavior, positive mental health, life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, and sense of control) in 5,012 Chinese and 1,935 German university students. School bullying victimization was far less frequently recalled by the Chinese sample (6.2%–12.6%) than the German sample (29.3%–37.0%), but victims had similar adverse mental health in both countries. In Germany, bullies and not-involved had equally good mental health, whereas bullies in China had poor mental health comparable to victims. Bullying victimization has similar adverse effects on mental health across countries. However, compared to the German students, the prevalence of school bullying is significantly lower, and bullies are also more likely to suffer mental health problems in adulthood in Chinese students. The differences of reasons for and consequences of being bullies are discussed and may have important implications for evolutionary theories and interventions of bullying.",1.0,1
"Musculoskeletal symptoms are increased in farmers, whereas the prevalence of chronified pain is unknown. Online interventions based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) have shown encouraging results in the general population, representing a promising approach for reducing pain interference in green professions (i.e., farmers, foresters, gardeners). We conducted a pragmatic RCT comparing a guided ACT-based online intervention to enhanced treatment-as-usual in entrepreneurs, contributing spouses, family members and pensioners in green professions with chronic pain (CPG: >/=grade II, >/=6 months). Recruitment was terminated prematurely after 2.5 years at N = 89 (of planned N = 286). Assessments were conducted at 9 weeks (T1), 6 months (T2) and 12 months (T3) post-randomization. The primary outcome was pain interference (T1). The secondary outcomes encompassed pain-, health- and intervention-related variables. No treatment effect for reduction of pain interference was found at T1 (beta = -0.16, 95%CI: -0.64-0.32, p = 0.256). Improvements in cognitive fusion, pain acceptance, anxiety, perceived stress and quality of life were found only at T3. Intervention satisfaction as well as therapeutic and technological alliances were moderate, and uptake and adherence were low. Results are restricted by low statistical power due to recruitment issues, high study attrition and low intervention adherence, standing in contrast to previous studies. Further research is warranted regarding the use of ACT-based online interventions for chronic pain in this occupational group. Trial registration: German Clinical Trial Registration: DRKS00014619.

"We present Activity Analysis as a new method for the quantification of subjective reports of altered states of consciousness with regard to the indicated level of simulated motor activity. Empirical linguistic activity analysis was conducted with dream reports conceived immediately after EEG-controlled periods of hypnagogic hallucinations and REM-sleep in the sleep laboratory. Reports of REM-dreams exhibited a significantly higher level of simulated physical dreamer activity, while hypnagogic hallucinations appear to be experienced mostly from the point of passive observer. This study lays the groundwork for clinical research on the level of simulated activity in pathologically altered states of subjective experience, for example in the REM-dreams of clinically depressed patients, or in intrusions and dreams of patients diagnosed with PTSD.",1.0,1
"22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disorder associated with neurodevelopmental, anxiety and mood disorders, as well as an increased risk for developing psychosis. Cortisol levels and stress reactivity reflect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis activity, and are believed to be altered in individuals that often experience daily-life stress, depression, and psychotic symptoms. However, it is unknown whether individuals with 22q11DS display an altered stress reactivity.We included 27 adults with 22q11DS (mean age: 34.1 years, 67% female) and 24 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC; mean age: 39.9 years, 71% female) into an experience sampling study. Throughout 6 consecutive days, we measured participants’ subjective stress related to current activity and at the same time collected salivary cortisol samples. Multilevel regression models were used to analyze cortisol reactivity to activity-related stress.Diurnal cortisol levels were significantly lower in the 22q11DS group compared to HCs (B=-1.03, p < 0.001). 22q11DS adults displayed significantly attenuated cortisol reactivity to activity-related stress compared to HCs (B = −0.04, p = 0.026). Post-hoc exploratory analysis revealed that these results were independent from 22q11DS psychiatric diagnosis or medication use.These results indicate that adults with 22q11DS have lower cortisol levels and attenuated cortisol response to daily stress, possibly resulting from an increased sensitization of the HPA-axis. This suggests that alterations in HPA-axis functioning, previously reported in several psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychotic disorder, and mood disorder, also appear to be present in adults with 22q11DS.",1.0,1
"AIMS: To (1) determine diabetes patients' acceptance of Internet-based interventions (IBIs) for depression, to (2) examine the effectiveness of an acceptance facilitating intervention (AFI) and to (3) explore subgroup specific effects. METHODS: 141 diabetes patients from two inpatient rehabilitation units and one outpatient clinic in Germany were randomly allocated to an intervention (IG) and a no-intervention control group (CG). The IG received an AFI consisting of a personal information session before filling-out a questionnaire on patients' acceptance of IBIs, predictors of acceptance (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and Internet anxiety) as well as sociodemographic, depression-related and diabetes-related variables. The CG filled out the questionnaire immediately. Patients' acceptance of IBIs was measured with a four-item scale (sum-score ranging from 4 to 20). RESULTS: The CG showed a low (50.7%) to medium (40.8%) acceptance with only 8.5% of all diabetes patients reporting a high acceptance of IBIs for depression. The AFI had no significant effect on acceptance (IG: M=10.55, SD=4.69, n=70; KG: M=9.65, SD=4.27, n=71; d=0.20 [95%-CI: -0.13;0.53]) and the predictors of acceptance. Yet, subgroup analyses yielded a trend for depressed, diabetes-related distressed, female and younger (<59) participants and for those who do not frequently use the Internet to profit from the AFI. CONCLUSION: Diabetes patients show a rather low acceptance toward IBIs for depression. Findings indicate that the AFI is likely to be effective in the subgroup of depressed, diabetes-related distressed, female or younger diabetes patients, but not in the whole target population. Hence, AFIs might need to be tailored to the specific needs of subpopulations.",0.0,0
"OBJECTIVES: Chronic tinnitus negatively impacts daily functioning. To specifically assess this impairment, the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) was developed. The current study investigated the hierarchical, eight-factorial structure for the German TFI and examined its psychometric properties. DESIGN: In an online assessment, the TFI and other validated health-related measurements were completed. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to investigate the factorial structure by testing two competing models: (1) a general factor model, and (2) a hierarchical second-order factor model. STUDY SAMPLE: 316 research volunteers (59.8% female) with low to moderate tinnitus distress were included. RESULTS: CFA revealed an insufficient fit of the data to the general factor model. For the hierarchical second-order factor model, an acceptable model fit was shown (chi(2)/df ratio = 2.74, RMSEA = 0.07, SRMR = 0.05, CFI = 0.95, TLI = 0.95). Correlational analyses between the TFI and measures assessing tinnitus distress, depression, sleeping difficulties, subjective well-being, and personality dimensions indicated high convergent and moderate discriminant validity. Internal consistency reliability was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the hierarchical, eight-factorial structure of the German TFI. The TFI is a promising inventory that should be used on a regular basis.HighlightsThe results of our study confirm the hierarchical eight-factorial structure of the German TFI.Confirmatory factor analysis revealed an acceptable model fit of the data.Convergent validity of the German TFI was high.Discriminant validity of the German TFI was moderate.The German TFI is a reliable questionnaire to assess tinnitus functional impairment.",0.0,1
"Behavior therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) aims to reduce avoidance, rituals, and discomfort in OCD-relevant situations. The Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT) measures these behavior-related outcomes in individually challenging OCD-related situations. The association of the BAT with OCD severity measures and its relevance for treatment outcome is, however, still unclear. The current study investigates, (1) if reactions on the BAT are related to OCD severity measures in an OCD sample (n = 28), (2) if treatment with two variants of cognitive-behavior therapy (exposure and response prevention versus metacognitive therapy) changes the BAT scores and (3) if these changes as well as pretreatment BAT avoidance are relevant for OCD treatment outcome as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Participants rated avoidance, ritual, and discomfort in three individually challenging OCD-related situations before and after therapy. For one of these situations, BAT dimensions were rated by the therapist and an independent rater in addition to the patients’ ratings. Correlational analyses found significant correlations between BAT discomfort and OCD severity measures like the Y-BOCS. A repeated measures ANOVA with pre- and posttest scores showed that all three BAT dimensions significantly decreased during both treatments. Hierarchical regression analyses (controlling for Y-BOCS pretest scores) revealed that changes in BAT discomfort as well as pretreatment BAT avoidance scores predicted the Y-BOCS posttest score. These findings suggest that the BAT is a distinct measure of behavior-related outcomes partly being relevant for OCD treatment outcome.",1.0,1
"Drivers of L3 automated vehicles (AVs) are not required to continuously monitor the AV system. However, they must be prepared to take over when requested. Therefore, it is necessary to design an in-vehicle environment that allows drivers to adapt their levels of preparedness to the likelihood of control transition. This study evaluates ambient in-vehicle lighting that continuously communicates the current level of AV reliability, specifically on how it could influence drivers’ take-over performance and mental workload (MW). We conducted an experiment in a driving simulator with 42 participants who experienced 10 take-over requests (TORs). The experimental group experienced a four-stage ambient light display that communicated the current level of AV reliability, which was not provided to the control group. The experimental group demonstrated better take-over performance, based on lower vehicle jerks. Notably, perceived MW did not differ between the groups, and the EEG indices of MW (frontal theta power, parietal alpha power, Task–Load Index) did not differ between the groups. These findings suggest that communicating the current level of reliability using ambient light might help drivers be better prepared for TORs and perform better without increasing their MW.",1.0,0
"BACKGROUND: One of the main problems of Internet-delivered interventions for a range of disorders is the high dropout rate, yet little is known about the factors associated with this. We recently developed and tested a Web-based 6-session program to enhance motivation to change for women with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or related subthreshold eating pathology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of dropout from this Web program. METHODS: A total of 179 women took part in the study. We used survival analyses (Cox regression) to investigate the predictive effect of eating disorder pathology (assessed by the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire; EDE-Q), depressive mood (Hopkins Symptom Checklist), motivation to change (University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale; URICA), and participants' age at dropout. To identify predictors, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. RESULTS: The dropout rate was 50.8% (91/179) and was equally distributed across the 6 treatment sessions. The LASSO analysis revealed that higher scores on the Shape Concerns subscale of the EDE-Q, a higher frequency of binge eating episodes and vomiting, as well as higher depression scores significantly increased the probability of dropout. However, we did not find any effect of the URICA or age on dropout. CONCLUSIONS: Women with more severe eating disorder pathology and depressive mood had a higher likelihood of dropping out from a Web-based motivational enhancement program. Interventions such as ours need to address the specific needs of women with more severe eating disorder pathology and depressive mood and offer them additional support to prevent them from prematurely discontinuing treatment.",0.0,0
"PURPOSE: To analyze body dissatisfaction in relation to orthorexic eating behavior in a sample of young females to further investigate characteristic features of orthorexic eating behavior and its association with other eating disorders. METHODS: N = 197 young females (age: M = 29.59, SD = 10.85 years) completed an online survey with the following questionnaires: the Dusseldorf Orthorexia Scale to measure orthorexic eating behavior, the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), measuring psychopathological aspects of disordered eating behavior, the Dresden Body Image Questionnaire (DKB-35) to measure five components of body image, and the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), measuring body dissatisfaction. RESULTS: In the total sample, Pearson correlations revealed that orthorexic eating behavior was positively associated with drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction. An independent samples t-Test revealed that females with elevated levels of orthorexic eating behavior (n = 35) displayed higher levels of drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction and lower levels of self-acceptance in comparison to a randomized sample from the remaining females with low levels of orthorexic eating behavior (n = 35). According to a multiple regression analysis, drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction measured by the BSQ served as positive predictors for orthorexic eating behavior, whereas bulimia and body dissatisfaction measured by the EDI-2 served as negative predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal that orthorexic eating behavior is more closely related to psychopathological aspects of other eating disorders than previously assumed. Body dissatisfaction as another major feature of orthorexia nervosa should be taken into account in future studies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, case-control analytic study.",1.0,1
"Abstract Background and objectives Many patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) go untreated due to a large treatment gap and fear of engaging in cognitive behavioral therapy. The present study investigated the effectiveness of mindfulness based training delivered as a bibliotherapeutic self-help approach, as an alternative and accessible intervention. Methods Eighty-seven participants with OCD anonymously completed an online baseline assessment that included measures of OCD and depression. Subsequently, they were randomly assigned to either mindfulness training or progressive muscle relaxation and received manuals accompanied by audio files. All participants were approached for reassessment six weeks later. Results No changes on any of the scales could be found in either the experimental or control group at post-assessment, even though all participants exercising mindfulness found the manual to be useful. Limitations Due to the mode of application, the study leaves open the possibility that mindfulness training is beneficial for OCD patients when delivered as a therapist guided intervention. Conclusions The effectiveness of mindfulness training as a self-help intervention was not supported in this study. Further work is needed to clarify whether mindfulness is feasible as a treatment for OCD.",0.0,0
"OBJECTIVE: Building on recent models of anorexia nervosa (AN) that emphasize the importance of impaired social cognition in the development and maintenance of the disorder, the present study aimed at examining whether women with AN have more difficulties with inferring other people's emotional and nonemotional mental states than healthy women. METHOD: Social cognition was assessed in 25 adult women with AN and 25 age-matched healthy women. To overcome limitations of previous research on social cognition in AN, the processing of social information was examined in a more complex and ecologically valid manner. The Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) reflects complex real-life social interaction and allows for disentangling emotional and non-emotional mental state inference as well as different types of errors in mentalizing. RESULTS: Women with AN showed poorer emotional mental state inference, whereas non-emotional mental state inference was largely intact. Groups did not differ in undermentalizing (overly simplistic theory of mind) and overmentalizing (overly complex or over-interpretative mental state reasoning). Performance in the MASC was independent of levels of eating disorder psychopathology and symptoms of depression and anxiety. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that AN is associated with specific difficulties in emotional mental state inference despite largely intact nonemotional mental state inference. Upon replication in larger samples, these findings advocate a stronger emphasis on socio-emotional processing in AN treatment.

"Self-regulation, especially the regulation of emotion, is an important component of athletic performance. In our study, we tested the effect of a self-distancing strategy on athletes' performance in an aggression-inducing experimental task in the laboratory. To this end, we modified an established paradigm of interpersonal provocation [Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP)], which has the potential to complement field studies in order to increase our understanding of effective emotion regulation of athletes in critical situations in competitions. In our experimental setting, we first tested the applicability of the self-distancing perspective and the athletes' ability to dynamically adapt besides the self-distanced perspective a self-immersed perspective to provocation in the TAP. Secondly, we investigated how this altered perspective modulated regulatory abilities of negative affectivity, anger, and aggression. The experiment consisted of two conditions in which the participant adopted either a self-immersed or a self-distanced perspective. Forty athletes (female: 23; male: 17) from different team (n = 27) and individual sports (n = 13) with a mean age of 23.83 years (SD = 3.41) competed individually in a reaction-time task against a (fictitious) opponent. Results show that athletes are equally able to adopt both perspectives. In addition, within-person analyses indicate that self-distancing decreased aggressive behavior and negative affect compared to the self-immersed perspective. Our results suggest that self-distancing modulates different levels of athletes' experience (i.e., affect and anger) and behavior. Furthermore, this demonstrates the feasibility of testing self-regulation of emotion in athletes in a laboratory setting and allows for further application in research in sports and exercise psychology.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Methodological problems of existing research, such as the application of unstandardized treatments in heterogeneous samples, has hampered clear conclusions about the extent and direction to which allelic variation of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5- HTTLPR) is associated with a differential response to psychological treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on treatment outcome under highly standardized environmental conditions. METHODS: We treated 222 medication-free adults highly fearful of spiders, dental surgeries or blood, injuries and injections with a highly standardized exposure-based 1-session treatment and genotyped them for the 5-HTTLPR. Participants' subjective fear was assessed before, immediately after treatment and at 7 months of follow-up. RESULTS: There were no differences between 5-HTTLPR genotypes in treatment outcome effects at the immediate posttreatment assessment. However, we observed a highly significant genotype x treatment effect (p = 0.004) at the 7-month follow-up. Fear levels of homozygous S allele carriers differed from those heterozygous (p = 0.026) and homozygous (p = 0.012) for the L allele. Compared to posttreatment assessment, LL allele carriers exhibited a further fear decrease at the follow-up assessment. In contrast, SS allele carriers displayed a strong return of fear. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that genetic variation of the serotonin transporter is associated with differential stability of inhibitory learning processes, potentially reflecting heightened susceptibility for context-related processes that facilitate a return of fear in S allele carriers. If replicated, results suggest the 5-HTTLPR might represent a biomarker for the long-term outcome of brief exposure-based fear treatments and might inform genotype-based selection of psychotherapeutic interventions.",0.0,0
"Objectives: Addressing the lack of population-based data, the purpose of this representative study was to assess sex- and age-specific associations of maternal and paternal rearing behavior with depressiveness and anxiety controlling for sociodemographic and somatic variables. Methods: 8,175 subjects participating in a population-based study completed standardized questionnaires measuring Recalled Parental Rearing Behavior and distress. Results: Women recalled their fathers as more controlling and warmer, and their mothers as more rejecting than men. Comparisons between age groups (</= 60 vs. > 60 years) revealed that younger participants recalled more parental control and emotional warmth. In addition to sociodemographic and somatic risk factors, paternal rejection and maternal control were associated with depressiveness and anxiety both for women and men (OR 1.58-1.96; OR 1.37-1.66). Maternal warmth was negatively related to distress (OR 0.66-0.69). Conclusions: Findings suggested sex- and age-specific differences in recalled maternal and paternal rearing behavior. The current results highlighted the important role of recalled parental rearing behavior besides sociodemographic factors and somatic diseases for the occurrence of depression and anxiety symptoms across the age groups.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: In recent years, armed conflicts in the Middle East have resulted in high rates of exposure to traumatic events. Despite the increasing demand of mental health care provision, ongoing violence limits conventional approaches of mental health care provision. Internet-based interventions for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have proved feasible and effective in Western countries, but their applicability and efficacy in war and conflict regions remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral Internet-based intervention for war-traumatized Arab patients, with focus on Iraq. METHODS: A total of 159 individuals with PTSD participated in a parallel group randomized trial. Participants were randomly allocated by a computer-generated sequence to a treatment group (n=79) or a waiting list control group (n=80). The treatment group received 2 weekly 45-minute cognitive behavioral interventions via Internet over a 5-week period (10 sessions in total). The primary outcome was recovery from posttraumatic stress symptoms. RESULTS: Posttraumatic stress symptoms were significantly reduced from baseline to posttreatment (intention-to-treat analysis) in the treatment group relative to the control group (F1,157=44.29, P<.001, d=0.92). Treatment effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up. Completer analysis indicated that 29 of 47 patients (62%) in the treatment group had recovered from posttraumatic stress symptoms at posttreatment (reliable change and Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale score <20) versus 1 patient (2%) in the control group (OR 74.19, 95% CI 9.93-585.8, P<.001) indicating that the chance of recovering was 74.19 times higher in the treatment than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate, even in unstable and insecure settings with ongoing exposure to human rights violations through war and dictatorships, people with posttraumatic stress symptoms benefit from a cognitive behavioral treatment provided entirely through the Internet. This method of delivery could improve patients' access to humanitarian aid in the form of e-mental health services.

"Appetitive conditioning is an important mechanism for the development, maintenance, and treatment of psychiatric disorders like substance abuse. Therefore, it is important to identify genetic variations, which impact appetitive conditioning. It has been suggested that the Val(158) Met-polymorphism in the Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase (COMT) is associated with the alteration of neural processes of appetitive conditioning due to the central role of the dopaminergic system in reward processing. However, no study has so far investigated the relationship between variations in the COMT Val(158) Met-polymorphism and appetitive conditioning. In this fMRI study, an appetitive conditioning paradigm was applied, in which one neutral stimulus (CS+) predicted appetitive stimuli (UCS) while a second neutral stimulus (CS-) was never paired with the UCS. As a main result, we observed a significant association between the COMT Val(158) Met-genotype and appetitive conditioning: skin conductance responses (SCRs) revealed a significant difference between CS+ and CS- in Val/Val-allele carriers but not in the other genotype groups. Val/Val-allele carriers showed increased hemodynamic responses in the amygdala compared with the Met/Met-allele group in the contrast CS+ > CS-. In addition, psychophysiological-interaction analysis revealed increased effective amygdala/ventromedial prefrontal cortex connectivity in Met/Met-allele carriers. The increased amygdala activity points to facilitated appetitive conditioning in Val/Val-allele carriers while the amygdala/prefrontal connectivity results could be regarded as a marker for altered emotion regulation during conditioning, which potentially impacts appetitive learning sensitivity. The SCRs finding indicates a stronger conditioned response in the Val/Val-allele group and dovetails with the neural differences between the groups. These findings contribute to the current research on COMT in emotional processing.",0.0,0
"Exposure-based therapies are considered the state-of-the-art treatment for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Yet, a substantial number of PTSD patients do not recover after therapy. In the light of the well-known gene x environment interactions on the risk for PTSD, research on individual genetic factors that influence treatment success is warranted. The gene encoding FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP5), a co-chaperone of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), has been associated with stress reactivity and PTSD risk. As FKBP5 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1360780 has a putative functional role in the regulation of FKBP5 expression and GR sensitivity, we hypothesized that this polymorphism influences PTSD treatment success. We investigated the effects of FKBP5 rs1360780 genotype on Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) outcome, an exposure-based short-term therapy, in a sample of 43 survivors of the rebel war in Northern Uganda. PTSD symptom severity was assessed before and 4 and 10 months after treatment completion. At the 4-month follow-up, there were no genotype-dependent differences in therapy outcome. However, the FKBP5 genotype significantly moderated the long-term effectiveness of exposure-based psychotherapy. At the 10-month follow-up, carriers of the rs1360780 risk (T) allele were at increased risk of symptom relapse, whereas non-carriers showed continuous symptom reduction. This effect was reflected in a weaker treatment effect size (Cohen's D=1.23) in risk allele carriers compared with non-carriers (Cohen's D=3.72). Genetic factors involved in stress response regulation seem to not only influence PTSD risk but also responsiveness to psychotherapy and could hence represent valuable targets for accompanying medication.",0.0,0
"The extent to which emotionally significant stimuli capture visual attention remains elusive because a preference for reporting or choosing emotionally significant stimuli could mimic attentional capture by these stimuli. We conducted two prior-entry experiments to disentangle whether phobic and fear-relevant stimuli capture attention or merely produce a response bias in spider-fearful participants. Prior entry denotes the effect that attended stimuli are perceived earlier than unattended stimuli as indicated by temporal order judgments. We presented phobic (spiders), fear-relevant (snakes) and neutral stimuli in pairs with varying temporal onset. The participants' task was to indicate which stimulus was presented first (Experiment 1) or second (Experiment 2). In the first experiment, spider-fearful but not control participants indicated that they had perceived spiders as occurring earlier in time, suggesting a prior-entry effect for spiders in this group. But surprisingly, in the second experiment, spider-fearful participants indicated more frequently that they had seen spiders as being presented second. This finding rules out a genuine prior-entry effect and instead suggests a strong preference for the response option associated with the feared animal. This response bias may result from a hypervigilance toward the feared stimulus and contribute to maintaining avoidance behavior in individuals with specific phobias.",0.0,0
"Killing people is universally considered reprehensible and evokes in observers a need to punish perpetrators. Here, we explored how observers' personality is associated with their cognitive, emotional, and punishing reactions towards perpetrators using data from 1,004 participants who responded to a set of fifteen third-party perspective moral dilemmas. Among those, four scenarios (architect, life boat, footbridge, smother for dollars) describing deliberate killings were compared to investigate the role of the content features ""motive for killing"" (selfish vs. utilitarian) and ""evitability of victims' death"". Participants' moral appropriateness ratings, emotions towards perpetrators, and assigned punishments revealed complex scenario-personality interactions. Trait psychopathy was associated with harsher punishments in all scenarios but also with less concern about killing in general, an increased moral appreciation of utilitarian motives for killing, and a reduced concern about the killing of avoidable victims. Need for cognition was associated with considering a utilitarian motive for killing as a mitigating factor, while intuitive/authority-obedient thinking was linked to a strong focus on avoidability of harm as an aggravating factor when assigning punishments. Other-oriented empathy, trait anxiety, and justice sensitivity did not account for differences in third-party punishments. Our explorative findings highlight the importance of inter-individual differences for moral decision making and sense of justice.",0.0,0
"Optimism is associated with a range of benefits not only for general well-being, but also for mental and physical health. The development of psychological interventions to boost optimism derived from cognitive science would have the potential to provide significant public health benefits, yet cognitive markers of optimism are little understood. The current study aimed to take a first step in this direction by identifying a cognitive marker for optimism that could provide a modifiable target for innovative interventions. In particular we predicted that the ability to generate vivid positive mental imagery of the future would be associated with dispositional optimism. A community sample of 237 participants completed a survey comprising measures of mental imagery and optimism, and socio-demographic information. Vividness of positive future imagery was significantly associated with optimism, even when adjusting for socio-demographic factors and everyday imagery use. The ability to generate vivid mental imagery of positive future events may provide a modifiable cognitive marker of optimism. Boosting positive future imagery could provide a cognitive target for treatment innovations to promote optimism, with implications for mental health and even physical well-being.",1.0,1
"Emotional words--as symbols for biologically relevant concepts--are preferentially processed in brain regions including the visual cortex, frontal and parietal regions, and a corticolimbic circuit including the amygdala. Some of the brain structures found in functional magnetic resonance imaging are not readily apparent in electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG; MEG) measures. By means of a combined EEG/MEG source localization procedure to fully exploit the available information, we sought to reduce these discrepancies and gain a better understanding of spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying emotional-word processing. Eighteen participants read high-arousing positive and negative, and low-arousing neutral nouns, while EEG and MEG were recorded simultaneously. Combined current-density reconstructions (L2-minimum norm least squares) for two early emotion-sensitive time intervals, the P1 (80-120 ms) and the early posterior negativity (EPN, 200-300 ms), were computed using realistic individual head models with a cortical constraint. The P1 time window uncovered an emotion effect peaking in the left middle temporal gyrus. In the EPN time window, processing of emotional words was associated with enhanced activity encompassing parietal and occipital areas, and posterior limbic structures. We suggest that lexical access, being underway within 100 ms, is speeded and/or favored for emotional words, possibly on the basis of an ""emotional tagging"" of the word form during acquisition. This gives rise to their differential processing in the EPN time window. The EPN, as an index of natural selective attention, appears to reflect an elaborate interplay of distributed structures, related to cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and evaluation of emotional stimuli.",1.0,1
"When students learn a scientific theory that conflicts with their earlier naive theories, the newer and more correct knowledge does not always replace the older and more incorrect knowledge. Both may coexist in a learner's long-term memory. Using a new speeded reasoning task, Shtulman and Valcarcel (2012) showed that naive theories interfere with retrieving scientific theories. Although mathematics learning is a central aim of schooling and a vital prerequisite for success in life, no study has tested whether Shtulman and Valcarcel's (2012) findings generalize to mathematical subdomains such as algebra, geometry, and probability. Additionally, it is unclear how the interference strength relates to domain-specific and domain-general competencies. We investigated these questions using the speeded reasoning task with new mathematical items in a sample of 62 university students. Solution rates and reaction times indicated interference between naive and scientific mathematical theories. Additionally, interference strength was inversely related to mathematical achievement and unrelated to general inhibitory control. After controlling for general inhibitory control, mathematical achievement was still substantially related to interference strength. These findings indicate that interference strength reflects domain-specific achievement rather than domain-general inhibitory control.",0.0,0
"Faces and voices are prominent cues for person-identity recognition. Face recognition behavior and associated brain responses can be enhanced by intranasal administration of oxytocin. It is unknown whether oxytocin can also augment voice-identity recognition mechanisms. To find it out is particularly relevant for individuals who have difficulties recognizing voice identity such as individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We conducted a combined behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate voice-identity recognition following intranasal administration of oxytocin or placebo in a group of adults diagnosed with ASD (full-scale intelligence quotient > 85) and pairwise-matched typically developing (TD) controls. A single dose of 24 IU oxytocin was administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and cross-over design. In the control group, but not in the ASD group, administration of oxytocin compared to placebo increased responses to recognition of voice identity in contrast to speech in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (pSTS/G) - a region implicated in the perceptual analysis of voice-identity information. In the ASD group, the right pSTS/G responses were positively correlated with voice-identity recognition accuracy in the oxytocin condition, but not in the placebo condition. Oxytocin did not improve voice-identity recognition performance at the group level. The ASD compared to the control group had lower right pSTS/G responses to voice-identity recognition. Since ASD is known to have atypical pSTS/G, the results indicate that the potential of intranasal oxytocin to enhance mechanisms for voice-identity recognition might be variable and dependent on the functional integrity of this brain region.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: E-cigarettes are considerably safer regarding health issues than conventional cigarettes, but there is uncertainty concerning its use for smoking cessation. OBJECTIVES: How and to what extent are E‑cigarettes used by smokers willing to quit? Are E‑cigarettes a useful intervention for smokers attending a group intervention for smoking cessation? MATERIALS AND METHODS: One year after attending a group intervention for smoking cessation in Germany, 637 attendants were assessed by telephone. The interview topics were the use of E‑cigarettes and tobacco abstinence. RESULTS: Of the attendants that could be interviewed, 12.6% had used E‑cigarettes during or after the smoking cessation intervention. At the beginning of the intervention these smokers smoked significantly more cigarettes and were more addicted to cigarettes than the other attendants. After one year significantly less E‑cigarette users were abstinent compared to participants that used nicotine replacement therapy or no additional smoking cessation aids. CONCLUSIONS: The application of E‑cigarettes is counterproductive for smokers looking for help in an abstinence oriented smoking cessation group. The lack of distinct, easy to follow instructions on the use of E‑cigarettes as a cessation tool may impair the process of cessation. Without good guidance smokers may get distracted in their motivation and willingness to stop smoking.",1.0,1
"Background: Although the family constitutes the prime source of risk and resilience for the well-being of children growing up in adverse conditions, the mental health of children living in refugee camps has rarely been investigated in conjunction with their parents' mental health. Objectives: To examine the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health problems among Burundian refugee children and their parents living in Tanzanian refugee camps and to identify patterns of comorbidity among children and their parents based on PTSD symptom levels and functional impairment. Methods: We recruited a representative sample of 230 children aged 7-15 years and both of their parents (n = 690) and conducted separate structured clinical interviews. Latent Class Analysis was applied to identify patterns of comorbidity. Results: Children and parents were exposed to multiple traumatic event types. In total, 5.7% of children fulfilled DSM-5 criteria for PTSD in the past month and 10.9% reported enhanced levels of other mental health problems. 42.6% indicated clinically significant functional impairment due to PTSD symptoms. PTSD prevalence was higher among mothers (32.6%) and fathers (29.1%). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) revealed a familial accumulation of PTSD symptoms as children with high symptom levels and impairment were likely to live in families with two traumatized parents. Conclusions: Although the number of children who need support for trauma-related mental health problems was relatively low, taking into account parental trauma could aid to identify at-risk children with elevated PTSD symptom levels and impairment even in the face of existing barriers to mental health care access for children in refugee camp settings (e.g. lack of targeted services, prioritization of managing daily stressors).",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Personal practice (PP) is an integral component of many psychotherapy training programmes. It aims to promote personal and professional growth and is often conducted in a group format (g-PP). Group cohesion is one of the most researched mechanisms in group psychotherapy, but has rarely been studied in the context of g-PP. AIMS AND METHOD: This exploratory study examines the associations between cohesion, satisfaction with g-PP, its impact on personal and professional development, and theoretical orientation in a sample of n = 329 German psychotherapy trainees. Cohesion was assessed with the group questionnaire (GQ-D; Positive Bonding, Positive Working, Negative Relationship). RESULTS: Overall, participants reported high levels of all outcome variables. Positive Bonding was the strongest predictor of satisfaction with g-PP (beta = 0.46, p<.001). While trainees in cognitive behaviour therapy reported significantly better cohesion scores (d>/=0.31), trainees in psychodynamic therapy reported significantly higher satisfaction with g-PP and its impact on their developments (d>/=0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Group cohesion appears to be an important factor in g-PP that should be actively promoted by group leaders. However, longitudinal study designs are needed to better understand the emergence of cohesion in g-PP as well as potential moderating factors.",0.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Alexithymia is a risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD) and has been associated with diminished treatment response. Neuroimaging studies have revealed structural aberrations of the anterior cingulate cortex and the fusiform gyrus in healthy controls with high levels of alexithymia. The present study tried to corroborate and extend these results to patients with MDD compared with healthy controls. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between alexithymia, depression and grey matter volume in 63 patients with MDD (mean age +/- standard deviation = 42.43 yr +/- 11.91; 33 female) and 46 healthy controls (45.35 yr +/- 8.37; 22 female). We assessed alexithymia using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. We conducted an alexithymia x group analysis of covariance; we used a region-of-interest approach, including the fusiform gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex, and conducted whole brain analysis using voxelbased morphometry. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a significant alexithymia x group interaction in the fusiform gyrus (left, pFWE = 0.031; right, pFWE = 0.010). Higher alexithymia scores were associated with decreased grey matter volume in patients with MDD (pFWE = 0.009), but with increased grey matter volume of the fusiform gyrus in healthy controls (pFWE = 0.044). We found no significant main effects in the region-of-interest analysis. LIMITATIONS: Owing to the naturalistic nature of our study, patients with MDD and healthy controls differed significantly in their alexithymia scores. CONCLUSION: Our results showed the fusiform gyrus as a correlate of alexithymia. We also found differences related to alexithymia between patients with MDD and healthy controls in the fusiform gyrus. Our study encourages research related to the transition from risk to MDD in people with alexithymia.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Increased neural error-signals have been observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, and inconsistently in depression. Reduced neural error-signals have been observed in substance use disorders (SUD). Thus, alterations in error-monitoring are proposed as a transdiagnostic endophenotype. To strengthen this notion, data from unaffected individuals with a family history for the respective disorders are needed. METHODS: The error-related negativity (ERN) as a neural indicator of error-monitoring was measured during a flanker task from 117 OCD patients, 50 unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients, and 130 healthy comparison participants. Family history information indicated, that 76 healthy controls were free of a family history for psychopathology, whereas the remaining had first-degree relatives with depression (n = 28), anxiety (n = 27), and/or SUD (n = 27). RESULTS: Increased ERN amplitudes were found in OCD patients and unaffected first-degree relatives of OCD patients. In addition, unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with anxiety disorders were also characterized by increased ERN amplitudes, whereas relatives of individuals with SUD showed reduced amplitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in neural error-signals in unaffected first-degree relatives with a family history of OCD, anxiety, or SUD support the utility of the ERN as a transdiagnostic endophenotype. Reduced neural error-signals may indicate vulnerability for under-controlled behavior and risk for substance use, whereas a harm- or error-avoidant response style and vulnerability for OCD and anxiety appears to be associated with increased ERN. This adds to findings suggesting a common neurobiological substrate across psychiatric disorders involving the anterior cingulate cortex and deficits in cognitive control.",1.0,1
"OBJECTIVE: To analyze treatment outcomes and the association between treatment effects and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for incontinent children, and their parents. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Health-related quality of life in 70 consecutively treated children, and their parents, was assessed with the Pediatric Incontinence Questionnaire and the WHO-Quality-Of-Life-BREF questionnaire. This was assessed before and after three months of standardized treatment. RESULTS: In 44.3% of children, symptoms decreased by 50-89%. After three months of treatment, the HRQoL of children improved significantly. Children with bladder and bowel dysfunction had a significantly lower HRQoL than children with isolated nocturnal enuresis, daytime urinary incontinence or fecal incontinence. Parental HRQoL did not change significantly within three months of treatment. Parents showed a significantly lower mean in the 'psychological' domain of the WHO-QoL-BREF questionnaire compared to norms. CONCLUSION: Children with different subtypes of incontinence can be treated effectively within three months of therapy. After three months, significant improvements of HRQoL were shown. Parents showed no general reduction in their quality of life (QoL). Specific aspects of parental QoL were impaired, but did not improve during the treatment of their children.",0.0,0
"Perfectionism is a multidimensional personality trait whose facets differentially relate to indicators of psychological functioning, such as global self-esteem. There has been some theoretical disagreement whether perfectionism affects global self-esteem, or vice versa. This question merits renewed attention due to increasing efforts to prevent the development of maladaptive perfectionism facets in adolescents. In addition, recent research has indicated a role of self-esteem for predicting personality development. This study aimed to clarify the longitudinal relations of multidimensional perfectionism and global self-esteem. A sample of 707 early adolescents participated in two measurement points two years apart. Global self-esteem positively predicted personal standards, negatively predicted doubts about actions, and did not predict concern over mistakes beyond baseline. Perfectionism facets did not longitudinally predict global self-esteem. These findings provide the first evidence for a role of global self-esteem in perfectionism development. Addressing early adolescents’ self-esteem may aid in preventing the development of maladaptive perfectionism facets.",0.0,0
"IMPORTANCE: Suicidal behavior is a leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults. In light of the ideation-to-action framework, the delineation of frequency and temporal characteristics of such behavior during this developmental period is crucial. OBJECTIVES: To provide lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates of suicidal behavior, including ideation, plan, and attempt, in adolescents and young adults of the general population, and to provide information about age at onset, temporal characteristics of suicidal behavior, including duration (number of years between onset and last occurrence) and frequency (number of episodes), and transition patterns across suicidal behaviors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in a random community sample of 1180 adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 21 years assessed in 2015 to 2016 in Dresden, Germany. Data analysis was performed from October 2018 to March 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime and 12-month suicidal behavior (ideation, plan, and attempt) were assessed with a standardized diagnostic interview (Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview) by trained clinical interviewers. The onset, frequency, and duration of suicidal behavior were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 1180 participants (495 male [weighted percentage, 51.7%]; mean [SD] age, 17.9 [2.3] years), 130 participants (10.7%; 95% CI, 9.0%-12.8%), 65 participants (5.0%; 95% CI, 3.9%-6.5%), and 41 participants (3.4%; 95% CI, 2.4%-4.7%) reported lifetime suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt, respectively. Any lifetime suicidal behavior was reported by 138 participants (11.5%; 95% CI, 9.7%-13.7%). Age-specific cumulative incidence estimates indicated an increase in suicidal behavior during adolescence, starting at age 10 years (<1%), increasing slightly until the age of 12 years (2.2%), and then increasing sharply thereafter until age 20 years (13.5%). There were different patterns among female and male participants for ideation, plan, and attempt, with an overall higher incidence among female participants for ideation (hazard ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.02-2.22; P = .04), for plan (hazard ratio, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.72-6.36; P < .001), and, among those older than 14 years, for attempt (hazard ratio, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.11-8.49; P = .03). Of those with suicidal ideation, 66.0% reported persistent or recurrent ideation over more than 1 year with 75.0% reporting more than 1 episode. Of the participants with lifetime suicidal ideation, 47.0% reported a suicide plan and 23.9% reported a suicide attempt. The transition to suicide plan or attempt occurred mainly in the year of onset of suicidal ideation or plan; of those who transitioned, 74.9% transitioned from ideation to plan, 71.2% transitioned from ideation to attempt, and 85.4% transitioned from plan to attempt in the same year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is an urgent public health need for timely identification of suicidal behavior in adolescents and young adults to terminate persistent or recurrent suicidal tendencies and to interrupt the ideation-to-action transition.",1.0,1
"Studies suggest that frontal alpha asymmetry is closely linked to psychological adjustment following stressful experiences, such that more left-sided frontal activation during symptom provocation might predict lower levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, we tested whether frontal asymmetry at rest and during exposure to neutral, positive, negative, and trauma-related images would be associated with PTSD, and particularly with characteristic reexperiencing symptoms. Symptoms were assessed in trauma victims with (n = 24) and without PTSD (n = 15), using both retrospective measures and 1-week ambulatory assessments with a diary and a smartphone. While resting frontal asymmetry was unrelated to all retrospective measures, left-sided activation in response to the negative picture correlated with lower levels of psychopathology. Left-sided activation in the trauma-related picture condition was more specifically associated with less emotionally intense intrusions and responses to viewing the picture, even when corrected for other symptoms of psychopathology. These effects tended to increase when participants with possible overreporting tendencies were removed from the analyses. Moreover, trauma victims without PTSD (i.e., relatively more resilient individuals) displayed higher left-sided frontal activation in response to the negative picture, also when compared with a third group of healthy, trauma-free individuals (n = 15). Our findings suggest that state-dependent changes in frontal asymmetry could serve as a biological marker of PTSD symptoms and could eventually be used for diagnostic purposes or as a target for neuromodulation interventions. Future studies should establish whether this marker can serve as an early predictor of psychopathology in recently traumatized individuals.",1.0,0
"OBJECTIVES: Impulsivity is related to a higher risk of relapse in alcohol use disorders. However, besides drinking behavior, other recovery outcomes like physical and mental health-related quality of life are at least as important. The present study aimed to fill a research gap regarding the association of different impulsivity facets with health-related quality of life and well-being in alcohol use disorder. METHODS: Individuals with a primary alcohol use disorder diagnosis (n = 167) were interviewed with standardized self-report measures at the progressed stage of their withdrawal treatment and 6 weeks thereafter. Multiple regression models were calculated to examine the association of impulsivity, craving, and drinking patterns with health-related quality of life and well-being 6 weeks after withdrawal treatment, as well as the predictive role of impulsivity assessed during withdrawal for these two outcomes. RESULTS: Craving was associated with health-related quality of life and well-being 6 weeks after withdrawal. Likewise, non-planning and attentional impulsivity were associated with well-being 6 weeks after withdrawal. Motor impulsivity during withdrawal treatment predicted health-related quality of life 6 weeks thereafter. CONCLUSION: Impulsivity seems to be negatively related to health-related quality of life and well-being in the first weeks after alcohol withdrawal treatment, probably to a higher extent than drinking patterns, but differentiating between its facets seems to be important. These findings emphasize the importance of treatment approaches aiming at reduced impulsivity in the early recovery process.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: No treatment for auditory neglect and no randomized controlled trial evaluating smooth pursuit eye movement therapy (SPT) for multimodal neglect are available. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of SPT and visual scanning therapy (VST) on auditory and visual neglect in chronic stroke patients with neglect. METHODS: A randomized, prospective trial was conducted. Fifty patients with left auditory and visual neglect were randomly assigned. Twenty-four patients completed SPT therapy and 21 patients VST. Five patients (4 VST, 1 SPT) were lost. Each group received 1-hour sessions of neglect therapy for 5 consecutive days totaling 5 hours. Outcome measures in visual neglect (digit cancellation, visuoperceptual- and motor line bisection, paragraph reading) and auditory neglect (auditory midline) were assessed twice before therapy, thereafter, and at 2-week follow-up. The SPT group practiced smooth pursuit eye movements while tracking stimuli moving leftward. The VST group systematically scanned the same but static stimuli. Both groups were divided into subgroups, and effects were separately investigated for mild and severe neglect. RESULTS: Both groups did not differ before therapy in clinical/demographic variables or neglect severity (auditory/visual). After treatment, the SPT group showed significant and lasting improvements in all visual measures and normal performance in the auditory midline. Neither visual nor auditory neglect impairments changed significantly after VST. Moreover, the treatment effect sizes (Cohen's d) were considerably higher for visual and auditory neglect after SPT versus VST, both for mild and severe neglect. CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive contralesional, smooth pursuit training induces superior, multimodal therapeutic effects in mild and severe neglect.",1.0,0
"Excessive anxiety and avoidance during provocation of body symptoms are core features of anxiety-related disorders and might contribute to the development and maintenance of these disorders. Previous studies examined psychological (anxiety sensitivity, fear of suffocation and trait anxiety) and biobehavioral (breath-holding time) predictors of reported anxiety during symptom provocation. However, the role of these predictors on avoidance of feared body symptoms remains unclear. Therefore, the present work aimed at investigating the main and interactive effects of psychological and biobehavioral variables in predicting avoidance during provocation of dyspnea that successively increased in severity. 28 of 69 participants prematurely terminated the provocation sequence, thus preventing further progression of symptom provocation. Logistic regressions revealed that higher anxiety sensitivity and lower breath-holding time were significantly associated with avoidance during exposure. Suffocation fear and trait anxiety were not related to avoidance. Moreover, there was a significant interaction between breath-holding time and anxiety sensitivity in predicting avoidance. Participants with a lower breath-holding time showed more avoidance behavior when reporting high as compared to low anxiety sensitivity. The data suggest that anxiety sensitivity and breath-holding time increase the risk to show avoidance and thus might contribute to the development and maintenance of anxiety-related disorders.",0.0,0
"Behavioral tendencies in the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) have mostly been assessed using a joystick as a response device. In recent years, other hardware devices such as tablets, smartphones, and computer mice have also been used. However, it remains unclear whether different response devices yield similar results and show comparable psychometric properties. The aim of the present study was to assess approach biases towards chocolate with different response devices and to compare their reliability and validity. Forty-five individuals with regular chocolate consumption completed three different AATs (joystick, computer mouse, touchscreen), each comprised of two blocks. In the compatible block of trials, chocolate-related pictures had to be pulled near while object-related pictures had to be pushed away. In the incompatible block of trials, instructions were reversed. Preregistered analyses revealed that participants were faster to pull than to push chocolate-related pictures relative to object-related pictures, indicating an approach bias for chocolate with no significant differences between response devices. Correlations among the three response devices were low to medium. Exploratory analyses revealed that approach biases were moderated by block order such that biases were only present and associated with craving (joystick AAT only) when the incongruent block was completed first. Internal consistencies of the bias score ranged between r(SB) = 0.67-0.76. Results of the present study point to the existence of an approach bias to chocolate regardless of response device, albeit each task seems to measure a different aspect of it. Order effects point to specific temporal dynamics in the acquisition of stimulus response (e.g., chocolate-pull) mappings that require further study.",0.0,0
"AIMS: To develop a psychometric measure of diabetes acceptance. METHODS: An item pool was developed and pilot-tested using a sample of 220 people with diabetes; item selection resulted in the 20-item 'Diabetes Acceptance Scale (DAS)'. 606 people with diabetes were then cross-sectionally assessed with the DAS to evaluate its reliability, validity and clinical utility; concurrent measurements included diabetes-related coping (FQCI), diabetes distress (PAID-5), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), quality of life (EQ-5D), self-management (DSMQ), glycaemic control (HbA(1c)) and complications. RESULTS: Internal reliability was high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.96). Factorial and criterion-related results supported validity. Higher diabetes acceptance scores correlated with more functional coping styles, lower distress and depression levels, higher treatment adherence, better glycaemic control and better quality of life (all P < .001). Persons with low diabetes acceptance (22% of the sample) were four times more likely to have HbA(1c) values over 9.0% (75 mmol/mol), two times more likely to be diagnosed with long-term complications and each over two times more likely to have had episodes of severe hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis in the past year; the prevalence of major depression in this group was fivefold increased (all P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The DAS is a reliable and valid tool to measure diabetes acceptance. It may help identify patients with significant problems of accepting diabetes, a putative high-risk group in need of tailored care and support.",1.0,1
"Theoretically, disgust sensitivity and disgust proneness could play an important role in hypochondriasis, since disgust is a defensive emotion widely believed to protect the organism from illness. However, empirical evidence to support this hypothesis has so far been based only on nonclinical samples, so that the importance and specificity of disgust for hypochondriasis remains unclear. In the current study, 36 patients with hypochondriasis, 27 with an anxiety disorder, and 29 healthy controls completed several measures which included the assessment of disgust sensitivity (Scale for the Assessment of Disgust Sensitivity) and disgust proneness (Questionnaire for the Assessment of Disgust Proneness). We found that patients with hypochondriasis and those with an anxiety disorder had higher scores than those of the healthy controls for several measures of disgust proneness. Moreover, measures of hypochondriacal characteristics were associated with those of disgust proneness and disgust sensitivity. However, no differences were found between patients with hypochondriasis and those with anxiety disorders, with respect to disgust proneness and disgust sensitivity. Therefore, it can be assumed that disgust proneness and disgust sensitivity seem to be less specific than previously suggested for the development and maintenance of hypochondriasis.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by an excessive preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in one's own appearance. Previous studies provided evidence for deficits in configural and holistic processing in BDD. Preliminary evidence suggests abnormalities at an early stage of visual processing. The present study is the first examining early neurocognitive perception of the own face in BDD by using electroencephalography (EEG). We investigated the face inversion effect, in which inverted (upside-down) faces are disproportionately poorly processed compared to upright faces. This effect reflects a disruption of configural and holistic processing, and in consequence a preponderance of featural face processing. METHODS: We recorded face-sensitive event-related potentials (ERPs) in 16 BDD patients and 16 healthy controls, all unmedicated. Participants viewed upright and inverted (upside-down) images of their own face and an unfamiliar other face, each in two facial emotional expressions (neutral vs. smiling). We calculated the early ERP components P100, N170, P200, N250, and the late positive component (LPC), and compared amplitudes among both groups. RESULTS: In the early P100, no face inversion effects were found in both groups. In the N170, both groups exhibited the common face inversion effects, with significantly larger N170 amplitudes for inverted than upright faces. In the P200, both groups exhibited larger inversion effects to other (relative to own) faces, with larger P200 amplitudes for other upright than inverted faces. In the N250, no significant group differences were found in face processing. In the LPC, both groups exhibited larger inversion effects to other (relative to own) faces, with larger LPC amplitudes for other inverted than upright faces. These overall patterns appeared to be comparable for both groups. Smaller inversion effects to own (relative to other) faces were observed in none of these components in BDD, relative to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest no evidence for abnormalities at all levels of early face processing in our observed sample of BDD patients. Further research should investigate the neural substrates underlying BDD symptomatology.",0.0,0
"Our aim was to evaluate isolated elements of psychological pain treatments and explore treatment effects on biological stress markers. We employed a single-case experimental design with multiple baselines. Matching pairs of twelve participants (chronic low back pain >6 months; elevated pain-related fear) were randomly assigned to graded in vivo exposure (EXP) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in a yoked design. Primary assessments were taken during baseline (7-26 days), treatment (23-44 days) and at 6-months follow-up (11-30 days) including changes in pain symptoms, disability, pain-related fear, acceptance, body confidence, self-efficacy, and positive thoughts. Psycho-educational, behavioral, cognitive, and exposure interventions were compared to baseline. EXP exhibited immediate middle-to-large effects; CBT's small-to-middle effects were delayed. Within the EXP approach, change mainly occurred during exposure but not during psycho-educational sessions. Overall cortisol was lower in EXP than CBT at post-treatment. We recommend integrating exposure elements in the management of CLBP to increase its efficacy. Psycho-educational sessions might not be necessary or should be adapted, e.g. with stronger focus on motivational aspects. Since CBT seemed to produce delayed effects, core CBT interventions such as cognitive restructuring might be added after exposure treatment to sustain therapeutic effects.",0.0,0
"Our ability to infer other individuals' emotions is central for successful social interactions. Based on the theory of embodied simulation, our mirror neuron system (MNS) provides the essential link between the observed facial configuration of another individual and our inference of the emotion by means of common neuronal activation. However, so far it is unknown, whether the MNS differentiates the valence of facial configurations. To increase the precision of our fMRI measurement, we used an adaptation design, which allows insights into whether the same neuronal population is active for subsequent stimuli of facial configurations. 76 participants were shown congruent, or incongruent consecutive pairs of facial configurations expressing fear or happiness. Significant activation for changes in emotional valence from adaptor to target was revealed in fusiform gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, amygdala, insula, inferior parietal lobe and Brodmann area 44. In addition, activation change was higher in superior temporal sulcus, insula and inferior frontal gyrus for a switch from happiness to fear than for fear to happiness. Our results suggest an involvement of the MNS in valence discrimination, and a higher sensitivity of the MNS to negative than positive valence. These findings point to a role of the MNS that goes beyond the mere coding of a motor state.",1.0,1
"In the current study, the influence of age, gender and IQ on cognitive and emotional empathy in school-aged children and adolescents was examined adopting two behavioural paradigms: participants were shown film clips with different scenes of social interaction to which they were asked to respond. Thus, 134 children aged seven to 17 years (mean age = 138.4 months, sd = 31.66 months) were tested for emotion recognition, perspective taking and emotional empathy. Age strongly influenced components of cognitive empathy and explained 33.5% to 39.1% of the variance. Gender and IQ also were significant predictors, yet only explained 3% to 5%, respectively 8% to 9% of the variance. In contrast, neither age, gender nor IQ were related to emotional empathy. Results suggest developmental maturation of cognitive, but not emotional empathy throughout childhood and adolescence. To explain variability in emotional empathy, additional biological and psychosocial factors need to be studied.",0.0,0
"Background: Approximately half of all asylum seekers suffer from trauma-related disorders requiring treatment, among them Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms. There is a lack of easily accessible, low-threshold treatments taking the cultural background into account. Culturally Adapted CBT (CA CBT) is a well evaluated, transdiagnostic group intervention for refugees, using psychoeducation, meditation, and Yoga-like exercises. Objective: An uncontrolled pilot study with male Farsi-speaking refugees from Afghanistan and Iran was conducted to investigate feasibility with this ethnic group; a group for which no previous CBT trials have been reported. Method: The participants were nine Farsi-speaking, male refugees with M.I.N.I./DSM-IV diagnoses comprising PTSD, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders. Treatment components were adapted to the specific cultural framework of perception of symptoms, causes, ideas of healing, and local therapeutic processes. Before and after 12 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Secondary outcome measures were the Posttraumatic Checklist, Patient Health Questionnaire, Somatic Symptom Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), Affective Style Questionnaire (ASQ), and Emotion Regulation Scale (ERS). Results: Seven participants completed treatment. In the completer analysis, improvements were found on almost all questionnaires. Large effect sizes were seen for the GHQ-28 (d = 2.0), WHOQOL-BREF scales (d = 1.0-2.3), ASQ tolerating subscale (d = 2.2), and ERS (d = 1.7). With respect to feasibility, cultural adaptation seemed to be a crucial means to promote effectiveness. Conclusion: CA CBT may reduce general psychopathological distress and improve quality of life. Improvement in emotion regulation strategies may mediate treatment effects. More support should be provided to enhance coping with the uncertainty of asylum status and stressful housing conditions. CA CBT appears to be a promising transdiagnostic treatment, serving as an initial low-threshold therapy in a stepped care approach.",1.0,1
"The COVID-19 pandemic is suggested to have a negative impact on mental health. To prevent the spread of Sars-CoV-2, governments worldwide have implemented different forms of public health measures ranging from physical distancing recommendations to stay-at-home orders, which have disrupted individuals' everyday life tremendously. However, evidence on the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures with mental health are limited so far. In this study, we investigated the role of sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors for immediate mental health consequences in a nationwide community sample of adults from Germany (N = 4335). Specifically, we examined the effects of different forms and levels of restriction resulting from public health measures (e.g. quarantine, stay-at-home order) on anxiety and depression symptomatology, health anxiety, loneliness, the occurrence of fearful spells, psychosocial distress and life-satisfaction. We found that higher restrictions due to lockdown measures, a greater reduction of social contacts and greater perceived changes in life were associated with higher mental health impairments. Importantly, a subjectively assumed but not an officially announced stay-at-home order was associated with poorer mental health. Our findings underscore the importance of adequate risk communication and targeted mental health recommendations especially for vulnerable groups during these challenging times.",0.0,0
"Depression (DEP) and dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) represent the most common neuropsychiatric disorders in elderly patients. Accurate differential diagnosis is indispensable to ensure appropriate treatment. However, DEP can yet mimic cognitive symptoms of DAT and patients with DAT often also present with depressive symptoms, impeding correct diagnosis. Machine learning (ML) approaches could eventually improve this discrimination using neuropsychological test data, but evidence is still missing. We therefore employed Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) and conventional Logistic Regression (LR) to retrospectively predict the diagnoses of 189 elderly patients (68 DEP and 121 DAT) based on either the well-established Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological assessment battery (CERAD-NAB) or a flexible battery approach (FLEXBAT). The best performing combination consisted of FLEXBAT and NB, correctly classifying 87.0% of patients as either DAT or DEP. However, all accuracies were similar across algorithms and test batteries (83.0% - 87.0%). Accordingly, our study is the first to show that common ML algorithms with their default parameters can accurately differentiate between patients clinically diagnosed with DAT or DEP using neuropsychological test data, but do not necessarily outperform conventional LR.",0.0,0
"This study investigates enhanced visuomotor processing of phobic compared to fear-relevant and neutral stimuli. We used a response priming design to measure rapid, automatic motor activation by natural images (spiders, snakes, mushrooms, and flowers) in spider-fearful, snake-fearful, and control participants. We found strong priming effects in all tasks and conditions; however, results showed marked differences between groups. Most importantly, in the group of spider-fearful individuals, spider pictures had a strong and specific influence on even the fastest motor responses: Phobic primes entailed the largest priming effects, and phobic targets accelerated responses, both effects indicating speeded response activation by phobic images. In snake-fearful participants, this processing enhancement for phobic material was less pronounced and extended to both snake and spider images. We conclude that spider phobia leads to enhanced processing capacity for phobic images. We argue that this is enabled by long-term perceptual learning processes.",1.0,1
"Abstract Background People with depression maintain negative expectations despite disconfirming positive experiences by reappraising or discarding novel positive information, referred to as “cognitive immunisation”. A second body of literature suggests that negative mood can negatively affect information processing. Bridging these two lines of research, the present study examined the interplay of cognitive immunisation and negative mood in the context of expectation modification. Methods In a student sample ( N = 152), we used a well-established experimental paradigm to examine the adjustment of performance expectations in response to positive performance feedback, and its relation to depressive symptoms. In a 2 × 2 design, participants received either a negative mood induction, a cognitive immunisation manipulation, both, or no further manipulation. Results Participants from all experimental groups revised their previous expectations significantly in line with positive performance feedback. However, depressive symptoms were a negative predictor of expectation adjustment, and a moderation analysis indicated that this effect was particularly pronounced if participants underwent the negative mood induction. Conclusions Consistent with previous work, depressive symptoms were associated with a reduced ability to integrate positive information. Furthermore, our results suggest that the activation of negative mood in people with elevated levels of depression may hamper learning from new positive experience.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: There have been numerous studies investigating the relationship between nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality. On the one side, NSSI is an important risk factor for suicidality, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors. On the other side, it has been suggested that one function of NSSI might be as a coping mechanism that can help individuals in the short term avoid suicide. The present study investigated the relationship between suicidality and NSSI in female inpatient adolescents, focusing on NSSI as an anti-suicide strategy. METHODS: Subjects were 56 female adolescents, aged 12-18 years (M = 15.95 years, SD = 1.27), recruited from different inpatient child and adolescent psychiatric units. All participants fulfilled the DSM-5 research criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury disorder (NSSI-D). To assess suicidality, NSSI-D, and current and past diagnoses, a structured clinical interview was conducted. RESULTS: NSSI as a short-term coping strategy for avoiding suicide was indicated by one third (32.1%) of the participants. Before participants engaged in NSSI, the anti-suicide function was reported more frequently than reducing interpersonal problems (d = -.59). Getting relief from negative emotions and inducing positive feelings were reported at the same frequency as avoiding suicide before NSSI. Participants engaging in NSSI to avoid suicide and those reporting other functions did not significantly differ regarding other NSSI characteristics, suicidality, or psychopathology. Results indicate that the anti-suicide function significantly predicts the duration of current suicidal ideation (beta = .557). CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary support for the idea that NSSI is frequently used by female adolescents with NSSI-D to avoid suicide. Given the high co-occurrence of NSSI and suicidality, our results underline the importance of clinical assessment of suicidality and several NSSI functions, including the anti-suicide function, in adolescents with NSSI.",1.0,0
"The intriguing interplay between acute stress physiology and cognitive processes has long been noted. However, while stress-induced release of glucocorticoids has repeatedly been shown to impact brain mechanisms underlying cognition and memory, less experimental research addressed the effects of stress-induced central sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation on cognitive performance. Moreover, despite the long-standing notion that the way performance is modulated by arousal may crucially depend on task complexity, mechanistic research demonstrating a direct, causal influence of altered SNS activity is scarce. Twelve healthy men participated in a placebo-controlled, pharmacologic dose-response study involving three within-subject assessments (1-week intervals). Subjective and objective indices of SNS activity as well as reaction time (RT) in three different tasks varying in cognitive demand (simple RT, choice RT, and verbal RT in complex mental arithmetic) were assessed during modulation of central SNS tone by intravenous infusions of dexmedetomidine (alpha2-agonist), yohimbine (alpha2-antagonist), and placebo. Cognitive performance was negatively affected by alpha2-agonism in all task conditions. By contrast, administration of yohimbine improved simple RT, while diminishing complex RT, supporting the assumption of a nonlinear way of action depending on task characteristics. Our results highlight the consequences of central (noradrenergic) SNS activation for cognitive-motor performance in RT tasks of varying complexity.",0.0,1
"Hippocampal and striatal circuits play important roles in spatial navigation. These regions integrate environmental information and receive intrinsic afferent inputs from the vestibular system. Past research indicates that galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is a non-invasive technique that modulates hippocampal and striatal activities. There are also evidences for enhanced motor and cognitive functions through GVS. This study extends previous research to investigate whether noisy GVS may improve hippocampal- and striatal-associated aspects of spatial navigation performance. Using a virtual navigation task, we examined effects of noisy GVS on spatial learning and memory. To probe the participants' sensitivity to hippocampal- or striatal-associated spatial information, we either enlarged the virtual environment's boundary or replaced an intra-environmental location cue, respectively. Noisy GVS or sham stimulation was applied online during the learning phase in a within-subject crossover design. The results showed that noisy GVS enhanced spatial learning and the sensitivity foremost to hippocampal-dependent spatial information both in males and females. Individual differences in spatial working memory capacity moderated the effects of GVS, with individuals with lower capacity benefitting more from the stimulation. Furthermore, sex-related differences in GVS effects on the two forms of spatial representations may reflect differences between males and females in preferred spatial strategies.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Maltreatment in childhood and adolescence is a risk factor for substance use disorders (SUDs) in adulthood. This association has rarely been investigated in the light of emotion dysregulation. To fill this gap, this study examines emotion dysregulation and SUDs among adults with a history of early maltreatment. METHODS: Comparison of emotion dysregulation in adults with a history of early abuse and neglect who developed either an SUD (n = 105) or no mental disorder (n = 54). Further, a mediation model for the association between the severity of early maltreatment and SUDs was tested. Participants completed research diagnostic interviews for psychopathology, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. RESULTS: By using hierarchical regression techniques and mediational analyses controlling for age and gender, it was possible to provide evidence for the mediating role of emotion dysregulation between early emotional and physical maltreatment and later SUDs. CONCLUSIONS: Emotion dysregulation is a potential mechanism underlying the relationship between early emotional and physical maltreatment and the development of SUDs. In light of these findings, focusing on the early training of adaptive emotion regulation strategies after childhood maltreatment might be of considerable relevance to prevent the development of SUDs.",1.0,1
"Unconscious stimuli can influence participants' motor behavior but also more complex mental processes. Recent research has gradually extended the limits of effects of unconscious stimuli. One field of research where such limits have been proposed is spatial cueing, where exogenous automatic shifts of attention have been distinguished from endogenous controlled processes which govern voluntary shifts of attention. Previous evidence suggests unconscious effects on mechanisms of exogenous shifts of attention. Here, we applied a cue-priming paradigm to a spatial cueing task with arbitrary cues by centrally presenting a masked symmetrical prime before every cue stimulus. We found priming effects on response times in target discrimination tasks with the typical dynamic of cue-priming effects (Experiments 1 and 2) indicating that central symmetrical stimuli which have been associated with endogenous orienting can modulate shifts of spatial attention even when they are masked. Prime-Cue Congruency effects of perceptual dissimilar prime and cue stimuli (Experiment 3) suggest that these effects cannot be entirely reduced to perceptual repetition priming of cue processing. In addition, priming effects did not differ between participants with good and poor prime recognition performance consistent with the view that unconscious stimulus features have access to processes of endogenous shifts of attention.",1.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Web-based interventions for individuals with depressive disorders have been a recent focus of research and may be an effective adjunct to face-to-face psychotherapy or pharmacological treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to examine the early change patterns in Web-based interventions to identify differential effects. METHODS: We applied piecewise growth mixture modeling (PGMM) to identify different latent classes of early change in individuals with mild-to-moderate depression (n=409) who underwent a CBT-based web intervention for depression. RESULTS: Overall, three latent classes were identified (N=409): Two early response classes (n=158, n=185) and one early deterioration class (n=66). Latent classes differed in terms of outcome (P<.001) and adherence (P=.03) in regard to the number of modules (number of modules with a duration of at least 10 minutes) and the number of assessments (P<.001), but not in regard to the overall amount of time using the system. Class membership significantly improved outcome prediction by 24.8% over patient intake characteristics (P<.001) and significantly added to the prediction of adherence (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in Web-based interventions outcome and adherence can be predicted by patterns of early change, which can inform treatment decisions and potentially help optimize the allocation of scarce clinical resources.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Since the Syrian civil war began in March 2011, more than half of the Syrian population was forced to escape from their homes, and more than 5 million of them fled their country. The aim of the present study is to estimate the psychological consequences of this conflict among the refugee population who fled to Iraq. METHOD: In 2017, a team of locally trained psychologists and social workers interviewed 494 married couples (988 individuals) who were Syrian Kurdish refugees in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Validated Kurdish Kurmanji and Arabic versions of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5 and depression section of Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 were used for assessing PTSD and depression symptoms. RESULTS: Almost all of the participants (98.5%) had experienced at least one traumatic event and 86.3% of them experienced three or more traumatic event types. The prevalence of probable PTSD was about 60%. Gender, length of time in the camp, area in which participants were grown up, and the number of traumatic event types were significant predictors for the presence of PTSD symptoms. Approximately the same rate of participants (59.4%) experienced probable depression, which was associated with gender, age, time spent in the camp, and the number of traumatic event types. CONCLUSION: PTSD and depression are prevalent among refugees exposed to traumatic events, and various variables play important roles. The pattern of risk factors in this population is consistent with findings from war-affected populations in other regions and should be considered for intervention within this population and more broadly.",1.0,1
"Perceived burdensomeness is considered a proximal risk factor for suicide ideation. However, there is a lack of prospective studies. Furthermore, it is unclear in as much psychotherapy for anxiety disorders is associated with a decrease in suicide ideation. A total of 105 adult outpatients suffering from panic disorder, agoraphobia, or specific phobia received manualized exposure-therapy. Perceived burdensomeness was considered as predictor of suicide ideation concurrently, after the fourth and the tenth therapy session and posttreatment - controlling for baseline symptom distress, suicide ideation, number of therapy sessions and age. Furthermore, pre-to post-changes in suicide ideation and perceived burdensomeness were assessed. Perceived burdensomeness emerged as a significant predictor of suicidal ideation concurrently and after the fourth and the tenth therapy session, but not at the end of therapy. Treatment had no effect on suicide ideation and only a marginal effect on perceptions of burdensomeness. In conclusion, the current study highlights the importance of perceptions of burdensomeness in understanding suicide ideation.",0.0,0
"INTRODUCTION: There has been growing interest in a better understanding of the etiology of compulsive sexual behavior (CSB). It is assumed that facilitated appetitive conditioning might be an important mechanism for the development and maintenance of CSB, but no study thus far has investigated these processes. AIM: To explore group differences in neural activity associated with appetitive conditioning and connectivity in subjects with CSB and a healthy control group. METHODS: Two groups (20 subjects with CSB and 20 controls) were exposed to an appetitive conditioning paradigm during a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, in which a neutral stimulus (CS+) predicted visual sexual stimuli and a second stimulus (CS-) did not. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood oxygen level-dependent responses and psychophysiologic interaction. RESULTS: As a main result, we found increased amygdala activity during appetitive conditioning for the CS+ vs the CS- and decreased coupling between the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex in the CSB vs control group. CONCLUSION: The findings show that neural correlates of appetitive conditioning and neural connectivity are altered in patients with CSB. The increased amygdala activation might reflect facilitated conditioning processes in patients with CSB. In addition, the observed decreased coupling could be interpreted as a marker for impaired emotion regulation success in this group.",1.0,1
"PURPOSE: Orthorexia nervosa is defined as the fixation on health-conscious eating behaviour and has recently been discussed as a new variant of disordered eating. The aim of the present study was to analyse orthorexic eating behaviour in an inpatient treatment sample of female anorexics to investigate the relation between anorexic and orthorexic eating behaviour. METHOD: Female anorexic patients with low (n = 29) and pronounced (n = 13) orthorexic eating behaviour as well as a matched control group composed of healthy females (n = 30) were compared with regard to several aspects of disordered eating, hypochondriacal traits, food consumption frequency and fulfilment of basic psychological needs in terms of eating. Orthorexic eating behaviour was assessed using the Dusseldorfer Orthorexie Skala. RESULTS: Fulfilment of basic psychological needs with respect to autonomy and competence is higher in anorexic individuals with pronounced orthorexic eating behaviour compared to patients with low orthorexic eating behaviour. Furthermore, patients with pronounced orthorexic eating behaviour state eating healthy food regardless of calorie content more often. No difference was found for hypochondriacal traits and eating disordered symptoms in general. CONCLUSIONS: Orthorexic eating behaviour enhances self-perception of eating behaviour as autonomous and competent, indicating that it might serve as a coping strategy in anorexic individuals. Further research is needed to investigate if this tendency in food selection strategy leads to positive effects in the long term.",0.0,0
"Background: Interoceptive abilities are known to be affected in anorexia nervosa (AN). Previous studies could show that private self-focus can enhance interoceptive accuracy (IAcc) in healthy participants. As body dissatisfaction is high in AN, confrontation with bodily features such as the own face might have a directly opposed effect in AN. Whether patients with AN can benefit from self-focus in their IAcc and whether this pattern changes over the time-course of cognitive behavioral therapy was investigated in this study. Methods: Fifteen patients with AN from the Psychosomatic Clinic in Windach were assessed three times in the time course of a standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy. They were compared to 15 controls, recruited from Ulm University and tested in a comparable setting. Both groups performed the heartbeat perception task assessing IAcc under two conditions either enhancing (""Self"") or decreasing (""Other"") self-focused attention. Furthermore, body dissatisfaction was assessed by a subscale of the Eating Disorder (ED) Inventory 2. Results: Patients with AN scored higher in IAcc when watching others' faces as compared to one's own face while performing the heartbeat perception task. The opposite pattern was observed in controls. IAcc remained reduced in AN as compared to controls in the time-course of cognitive-behavioral therapy, while body-dissatisfaction improved in AN. High body dissatisfaction was related to poorer IAcc in the ""Self"" condition. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that using self-focused attention reduces IAcc in AN while the opposite pattern was observed in controls. Confronting anorexic patients with bodily features might increase body-related avoidance and therefore decrease IAcc. The current study introduces a new perspective concerning the role of interoceptive processes in AN and generates further questions regarding the therapeutic utility of methods targeting self-focus in the treatment of AN.",1.0,0
"The outbreak of Covid-19 has significantly restricted people's everyday life and contributed to enhanced social media use (SMU). The present study investigated the relationship of burden caused by Covid-19 and addictive SMU. Data were assessed in a sample of 550 users of social media (age: M (SD) = 27.08 (6.74)) from Germany via online surveys in spring 2020. In a moderated mediation analysis, the positive association between burden and addictive SMU was significantly mediated by the level of perceived sense of control. Anxiety symptoms significantly moderated the relationship between sense of control and addictive SMU. Specifically, the link between both variables was significant only for medium and high levels of anxiety symptoms. The present findings disclose the mechanisms that can contribute to the development of addictive tendencies during the pandemic outbreak. Potential practical implications and ways of how the negative consequences of burden caused by Covid-19 might be prevented are discussed.",0.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Overgeneralization of fear is a pathogenic marker of anxiety and stress-related disorders and has been linked with perceptual discrimination deficits, reduced fear inhibition, and prefrontal hyporeactivity to safety-signaling stimuli. We aimed to examine whether behavioral and neural patterns of fear generalization are influenced by the fear-inhibiting ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). METHODS: Three groups of healthy participants received excitatory (n = 27), inhibitory (n = 26), or sham (n = 26) transcranial direct current stimulation of the vmPFC after a fear conditioning phase and before a fear generalization phase. We obtained, as dependent variables, fear ratings and unconditioned stimulus-expectancy ratings, perceptual aspects of fear generalization (perceptual discrimination), pupil dilations, and source estimations of event-related fields elicited by conditioned and generalization stimuli. RESULTS: After inhibitory (compared with excitatory and sham) vmPFC stimulation, we observed reduced performance in perceptual discrimination and less negative inhibitory gradients in frontal structures at midlatency and late time intervals. Fear and unconditioned stimulus-expectancy ratings as well as pupil dilation remained unaffected by stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a causal contribution of vmPFC reactivity to generalization patterns and suggest that vmPFC hyporeactivity consequent on inhibitory vmPFC stimulation may serve as a model for pathological processes of fear generalization (reduced discrimination, impaired fear inhibition via frontal brain structures). This encourages further basic and clinical research on the potential of targeted brain stimulation to modulate fear generalization and overgeneralization.",0.0,0
"OBJECTIVE: Patients with somatic symptom disorder (SSD) often receive targeted intervention only after a long duration of illness. Moreover, the reported effect sizes of interventions for SSD are small. Therefore, improvement and evaluation of interventions are needed. Preliminary evidence suggests autonomic imbalance, for example, lower heart rate variability (HRV) in SSD. HRV biofeedback (HRV-BF) as a method for self-regulation shows initial positive effects in chronic pain and functional syndromes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a brief HRV-BF intervention for SSD. METHODS: Of a total of 50 participants with SSD ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ) who were recruited and randomly assigned to four sessions of HRV-BF ( n = 25) or autogenic training (AT; n = 25), 49 participants were analyzed (female, 77.6%; mean [standard deviation] age = 45.3 [14.4] years). The primary outcomes were somatic symptom severity (Screening for Somatoform Disorders, numeric rating scale) and HRV. Secondary outcomes were psychological characteristics of SSD (e.g., the Somatic Symptom Disorder 12 scale, health concerns, emotion regulation). The data were collected before and after intervention and were analyzed with repeated-measures analyses of variance and post hoc t tests. RESULTS: Symptom severity improved after both, HRV-BF and AT. Standard Deviation of the NN Interval and psychological symptoms improved significantly more strongly in the HRV-BF than in the AT group (e.g., Standard Deviation of the NN Interval: etap2 interaction = 0.10, p = .047). CONCLUSIONS: The improvements in somatic symptoms, but specifically in cognitive-affective symptoms and autonomic regulation, suggest that HRV-BF with only four sessions is a potentially useful intervention option for SSD. Thus, adding this short HRV-BF intervention to existing psychological treatments for SSD may be promising.Trial Registration : German Clinical Trial Register identifier DRKS00017099 ( https://www.drks.de ).",1.0,1
"This study investigates the predictors of outcome in a secondary analysis of dropout and completer data from a randomized controlled effectiveness trial comparing CBTp to a wait-list group (Lincoln et al., 2012). Eighty patients with DSM-IV psychotic disorders seeking outpatient treatment were included. Predictors were assessed at baseline. Symptom outcome was assessed at post-treatment and at 1-year follow-up. The predictorxgroup interactions indicate that a longer duration of disorder predicted less improvement in negative symptoms in the CBTp but not in the wait-list group whereas jumping-to-conclusions was associated with poorer outcome only in the wait-list group. There were no CBTp specific predictors of improvement in positive symptoms. However, in the combined sample (immediate CBTp+the delayed CBTp group) baseline variables predicted significant amounts of positive and negative symptom variance at post-therapy and 1-year follow-up after controlling for pre-treatment symptoms. Lack of insight and low social functioning were the main predictors of drop-out, contributing to a prediction accuracy of 87%. The findings indicate that higher baseline symptom severity, poorer functioning, neurocognitive deficits, reasoning biases and comorbidity pose no barrier to improvement during CBTp. However, in line with previous predictor-research, the findings imply that patients need to receive treatment earlier.",0.0,0
"This study investigates the interpretative bias in spider phobia with respect to rapid visuomotor processing. We compared perception, evaluation, and visuomotor processing of ambiguous schematic stimuli between spider-fearful and control participants. Stimuli were produced by gradually morphing schematic flowers into spiders. Participants rated these stimuli related to their perceptual appearance and to their feelings of valence, disgust, and arousal. Also, they responded to the same stimuli within a response priming paradigm that measures rapid motor activation. Spider-fearful individuals showed an interpretative bias (i.e., ambiguous stimuli were perceived as more similar to spiders) and rated spider-like stimuli as more unpleasant, disgusting, and arousing. However, we observed no differences between spider-fearful and control participants in priming effects for ambiguous stimuli. For non-ambiguous stimuli, we observed a similar enhancement for phobic pictures as has been reported previously for natural images. We discuss our findings with respect to the visual representation of morphed stimuli and to perceptual learning processes.",0.0,0
"OBJECTIVES: Physical activity and healthy eating seem to be protective against experiencing stress and negative affect as well as increase positive affect. At the same time, previous studies showed that people reduce salutogenic behaviours such as physical activity and healthy eating in the face of stress and negative affect while increasing such behaviours in the context of positive affect. Due to daily fluctuations of these behaviours, the present study examined these relationships in daily life using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-one university students responded to six daily prompts during 7 days via smartphone-based EMA. Items examined stress, emotional experience, physical activity duration, and healthy eating. RESULTS: Higher stress and negative affect, as well as lower positive affect, were related to a reduction in subsequent physical activity. Higher physical activity levels, in turn, were associated with less subsequent stress and negative affect, as well as more positive affect. No such effects for stress and affect on healthy eating or vice versa were found. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging in physical activity is related to better mood and less stress/negative affect over the next several hours in daily life. Prevention efforts therefore may benefit by focusing on promoting physical activity, particularly when stress/negative affect is high to 'break the cycle' of inactivity, stress, and negative affect. Potential effects of healthy eating might be more subtle and characterized by interindividual differences or state effects. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Physical activity can reduce stress as well as negative emotions and can enhance positive emotions. People tend to eat less healthy food during stressful times, and healthy eating can increase general health. Physical activity and healthy eating have been mostly assessed separately and through retrospective methods. What does this study add? This is an EMA study investigating bidirectional effects of stress, emotions, and salutogenic behaviour. After physical activity, people felt less stressed/negative and more positive; feeling better and less stressed resulted in more physical activity. Healthy eating was not associated with stress or emotion level and vice versa.",0.0,0
"Bullying experiences in outpatients of a child and adolescent psychotherapy centre - A particularly vulnerable group? Abstract. Objective: Bullying has both short- and long-term effects on physical and mental health. Thus, more victimized children might tend to be found in clinical samples. This is the first study to examine the prevalence of bullying roles and modes in children/adolescents in a psychotherapeutic outpatient setting in Germany. Method: 298 outpatients being treated in a child/adolescent psychotherapy centre (6-20 years, 50.7 % female) completed a questionnaire concerning their bullying experiences over the last 6 months. Results: 24.5 % of the patients reported from a victim's perspective, independent of being perpetrators of bullying. 19.1 % reported solely as victims, 5.4 % as victims who also bullied (bully-victims), and 2.0 % as bullies. More than one-third of those with victim or bully-victim experiences had been polyvictimized, 86.2 % were victims solely of traditional bullying, and 1.4 % solely of cyberbullying. The exploratory comparison to general-population school samples seems to show significantly more patients with victim experiences and significantly less patients who bullied others. There seem to be no significant effects for bully-victims. Compared to an inpatient sample, significantly fewer adolescent patients seem to state being victims or bully-victims. Conclusions: Bullying is a topic of particular importance in the context of psychotherapy. These findings have implications for the psychotherapeutic practice as well as training settings.",0.0,0
"Previous studies indicate that participants with eating disorders show an attentional bias for the negatively valenced body parts of their own body. However, the neural basis underlying these processes has not been investigated. We conducted a preregistered combined functional MRI (fMRI)/eye tracking study and presented 35 women with binge eating disorder (BED) and 24 weight-matched control subjects (CG) with body part images of their own body and a weight-matched unknown body. After the fMRI examination, participants rated the attractiveness of the presented body parts. As expected, women with BED responded with significantly higher insula and amygdala activity when viewing the negatively valenced body parts of their own body (compared to all other combinations). However, individuals with BED did not deviate from the CG in the processing of these stimuli in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the extrastriate body area or the fusiform body area. Our results indicate that the negative valued body parts carry a particularly strong emotional valence in individuals with BED. These results further emphasize the relevance of processing bias for negatively valenced body parts in the pathology of BED. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",0.0,0
"Abstract Background Humans constantly compare their attributes to different reference frames. According to the theoretical framework of the general comparative-processing model, such comparisons may be perceived as aversive (i.e., appraised as threatening the motives of the comparer) or appetitive (i.e., appraised as consonant with, or positively challenging the motives). However, we lack a measure that adequately captures multi-standard comparisons. Methods Considering appearance-related comparisons as a relevant comparison domain, we introduce the Comparison Standards Scale for Appearance (CSS-A) that assesses appearance-related social, temporal, counterfactual, criteria-based, and dimensional upward and downward comparisons regarding their (a) frequency, (b) perceived discrepancy, and (c) engendered affect. We administered the CSS-A to 1121 participants, along with measures of appearance social comparison, body satisfaction, physical self-concept, self-esteem, well-being, and depression. Results A two-factor model ( aversive and appetitive comparisons ) fit the data better than a bifactor model with an additional general domain-factor ( comparative thinking ). The validity of the CSS-A was supported by correlations with external validators beyond appearance, social comparison, and body satisfaction. Aversive comparisons displayed higher associations with most outcomes than appetitive comparisons. Conclusions Overall, the CSS-A offers a psychometrically sound and useful measure of multi-standard comparisons.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) is a valid and reliable self-report measure for the assessment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Recently the PCL was updated according to the DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. So far only a few studies have examined the psychometric properties of the PCL-5, and all of these are restricted to populations living in industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to determine the psychometric properties and diagnostic utility of the PCL-5 as a screening instrument for war-affected displaced Kurdish and Arab populations. The specific goal was to determine a contextually valid cut-off score for a probable diagnosis of PTSD. METHODS: The PCL-5 was translated into Arabic and two Kurdish dialects. Trained interviewers administered these translations as assisted self-reports to 206 adults living in camps for displaced people in Iraq, together with depression and war-exposure instruments. Two weeks later, 98 randomly chosen subjects were reassessed by expert clinical psychologists. In the absence of a gold-standard instrument with proven validity in this context, the expert interviewers applied the PCL-5 items in the form of a clinical interview and used a DSM-5-algorithm to determine a diagnosis of PTSD. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) were performed to determine a valid cutoff-score. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the PCL-5 was high (alpha = .85) and the instrument showed an adequate convergent validity. Using the cut-off score of 23, the PCL-5 achieved the optimal balance of sensitivity and specificity (area under the curve = .82, p < .001; sensitivity = .82, specificity = .70). CONCLUSIONS: Given that the comparison of the two assessments included both a re-test interval and validation by different interviewers, our results indicate that the PCL-5 can be recommended as an assessment and screening instrument for Kurdish and Arab populations.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: In several conflicts worldwide children are recruited as fighters in irregular forces. These children need to be reintegrated into the society after the conflict. However, concurrent to various reservations in the communities, the reintegration of former child soldiers is challenged by the fact that many of the affected children were indoctrinated by the armed group and traumatized through war events. Even several years after the defeat of the terrorist organization ISIS in Iraq, systematic efforts towards the reintegration of children who had been recruited by ISIS are notably absent. METHODS: we conducted clinical interviews with a sample of N = 59 adolescents and young adults who were incarcerated for terrorism in the prisons of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq to assess levels and types of trauma exposure, PTSD, depression, readiness to reintegrate and ongoing identification with ISIS. RESULTS: We found high levels of PTSD and depression that were associated with trauma exposure. The subjective readiness to reintegrate into the communities was associated with trauma exposure and was mediated by depression, even after controlling for the influence of ongoing identification with the armed group. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that trauma-related mental ill-health should be considered in efforts to reintegrate young former terrorists.",1.0,1
"Previous research has demonstrated that task-irrelevant emotional distractors interfere with task performance especially under low phasic executive control (i.e., in nonconflict trials). In the present study, we measured medio-frontal ERPs (N2 and correct-related negativity, CRN) to elucidate which aspects of task performance are affected by emotional interference in a flanker task. To create emotional interference, negative and neutral pictures were presented during the flanker stimuli. N2 and CRN were reduced after negative pictures, indicating that conflict processing and performance monitoring are both affected by emotional interference. On the behavioral level, prolonged response times after negative pictures were observed under low phasic executive control (i.e., in compatible trials). Additionally, we explored whether emotional interference is modulated not only by phasic changes in executive control (i.e., conflict vs. nonconflict trials) but also by tonic changes in executive control (i.e., low vs. high overall conflict frequency). To this end, the flanker task consisted of two blocks with 25% versus 75% incompatible trials. Prolonged response times after negative pictures in compatible trials were observed only under low tonic executive control but not under high executive control.",0.0,0
"ABSTRACTBackground: Re-learning of lexical entries is fundamental to rehabilitation of the common word finding deficits in language disorders after brain damage. Previous studies examined and compared neural correlates of speech production and word learning in aphasic and healthy speakers, but longitudinal control studies were rarely set out to mimic the lexical confusion and therapeutic remediation in aphasia.Aims: Thus, we aimed to examine functional brain organisation before (familiar word naming), during (learning phase) and after (consolidation phase) standardised training of speech production modulated by aphasia therapy.Methods & Procedures: During the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement, participants were asked to name pictures using familiar words; during learning and in the consolidation phase, they were asked to name pictures using newly acquired pseudowords. To examine differential involvement of brain areas dependent on learning and consolidation success, we followe...",1.0,1
"Abstract Catastrophizing thoughts may contribute to the development of anxiety, but functional emotion regulation may help to improve treatment. No study so far directly compared up- and down-regulation of fear by cognitive reappraisal. Here, healthy individuals took part in a cued fear experiment, in which multiple pictures of faces were paired twice with an unpleasant scream or presented as safety stimuli. Participants (N = 47) were asked (within-subjects) to down-regulate, to up-regulate and to maintain their natural emotional response. Valence and arousal ratings indicated successful up- and down-regulation of the emotional experience, while heart rate and pupil dilation increased during up-regulation, but showed no reduction in down-regulation. State and trait anxiety correlated with evaluations of safety but not threat stimuli, which supports the role of deficient safety learning in anxiety. Reappraisal did not modulate this effect. In conclusion, this study reveals evidence for up-regulation effects in fear, which might be even more efficient than down-regulation on a physiological level and highlights the importance of catastrophizing thoughts for the maintenance of fear and anxiety.",0.0,0
"INTRODUCTION: As an especially burdensome experience, childhood maltreatment (CM) can have lifelong consequences on the mental health and wellbeing of an individual well into adulthood. We have previously reported that CM constitutes a central risk factor not only for the development of mental problems, but also for facing additional psychosocial risks, endangering healthy development of mother and offspring throughout life (e.g., financial problems, intimate partner violence, substance use). This study was designed to replicate these findings in a larger, independent study cohort. METHOD: In this cross-sectional replication study an independent cohort of 533 healthy postpartum women was interviewed within seven days after parturition. CM experiences were assessed retrospectively using the German version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and current psychosocial risk factors for child welfare were assessed using the Konstanzer Index (KINDEX). RESULTS: Of all women, 16.1% experienced emotional and 10.1% physical abuse, 28.5% emotional neglect, 9.4% physical neglect and 10.3% experienced sexual abuse. Most importantly, the higher the CM load the more psychosocial stressors existed in women's life. In Particular, women with higher CM load had a higher risk for mental health problems, intimate partner violence, financial problems, and a higher postnatal stress load. CONCLUSIONS: In an independent sample, this study replicated the previous findings that CM and psychosocial risk factors for child welfare were strongly associated in a dose-response manner. Our results emphasize the higher vulnerability of women with a CM history in the postpartum period. To avoid negative consequences for mother and child, a regular and evidence-based screening for CM and psychosocial risk factors during pregnancy and puerperium is needed to identify at-risk mothers early during pregnancy and to provide appropriate support. Hence, our findings highlight the mandatory requirement for an interdisciplinary collaboration of gynecological practices, hospitals and midwifes, along with psychologists and psychotherapists and child and youth welfare services.",1.0,1
"INTRODUCTION: Talking about death and dying is evoking discomfort in many persons, resulting in avoidance of this topic. However, end-of-life discussions can alleviate distress and uncertainties in both old and young adults, but only a minority uses this option in palliative care. Even in healthy populations, talking about death is often seen as alleviative and worthwhile, but rarely initiated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate different psychological interventions (a) encouraging the readiness for end-of-life discussions and (b) changing death attitudes in healthy adults of different ages. METHODS: 168 participants were randomized to four different interventions (IG1: value-based intervention with end-of-life perspective, IG2: motivation-based intervention with end-of-life perspective, IG3: combination of IG1 and IG2, CG: control group). Primary outcome was the readiness to engage in end-of-life topics. Secondary outcomes were fear of death, fear of dying and death acceptance. Assessments took place before, directly after the intervention and at 2 weeks of follow up. RESULTS: IG2 and IG3 reported significantly more changes in the readiness to engage in end-of-life discussions than the CG (F[5.61, 307] = 4.83, p < 0.001, etap2 = 0.081) directly after the intervention. The effect of IG3 remained stable at the follow-up. There were no significant effects of the interventions on end-of-life fears or death acceptance. Acceptability of the interventions was very high. CONCLUSIONS: Short interventions can be useful to encourage end-of-life discussions and could be integrated in health care programs. The efficacy and effectiveness of these short interventions in palliative patients are currently examined.",0.0,0
"AIMS: Elimination disorders are common in typically developing children. Only few studies have addressed elimination disorders in persons with intellectual disability (ID)-and even fewer studies in those with specific syndromes. The aim of the study was to investigate the rates of elimination disorders and behavioral symptoms in persons with Prader-Willi (PWS) and Fragile-X syndromes (FXS) in a large sample. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-seven persons with PWS or FXS were recruited through parent self-help groups. A questionnaire regarding elimination symptoms, as well as the child behavior checklist (CBCL)/young adult behavior checklist (YABCL) were filled out by parents or caregivers. RESULTS: The sample included 191 persons with PWS (54.5% male) with a mean age of 20.0 years and 166 persons with FXS (92.2% male) with a mean age of 15.4 years. Persons with FXS were significantly more often affected by elimination disorders. 29.3% of persons with PWS and 48.8% of persons with FXS had at least one elimination disorder. Persons with FXS also had more often DUI (29.5% vs. 12.0%) and FI (28.9% vs. 12.6%). Rates of NE were similar in both groups (22.0% in PWS vs. 28.9% in FXS). Young adults with PWS had more behavioral symptoms in the clinical range (70.8% vs. 48.3%). Incontinence and behavioral symptoms were significantly associated in persons with FXS. CONCLUSIONS: NE, DUI, and FI are very common in persons with FXS and PWS and are associated with other behavioral symptoms in persons with FXS. They persist into adulthood. Early assessment and treatment are recommended.",0.0,1
"Differentiating bipolar disorders (BD) from unipolar depression (UD) remains a major clinical challenge. The identification of neurobiological markers may help to differentiate these disorders, particularly during depressive episodes. This cross-sectional study, including 33 patients with UD, 33 patients with BD, and 34 healthy controls, is one of the first to directly compare UD and BD with respect to reward processing. A card-guessing paradigm was employed and brain activity associated with reward processing was investigated by means of fMRI. A 3 (group) x 2 (condition: reward>control, loss>control) ANOVA was conducted using the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) as ROI. Furthermore, a whole-brain approach was applied. A functional connectivity analysis was performed to characterize diagnosis-related alterations in the functional coupling between the NAcc and other brain areas. The ANOVA revealed higher activity for healthy controls (HCs) than for BD and UD in the NAcc during reward processing. Moreover, UD showed a higher functional connectivity between the NAcc and the VTA than HC. The patients groups could be differentiated in that BD showed a decreased activation, in the reward condition, of the NAcc, caudate nucleus, thalamus, putamen, insula, and prefrontal areas compared with UD. These results may help to refine the understanding of neural correlates of reward processing in both disorders, and to understand the neural underpinnings of anhedonia, a core symptom of depressive episodes.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Abnormal forms of grief, currently referred to as complicated grief or prolonged grief disorder, have been discussed extensively in recent years. While the diagnostic criteria are still debated, there is no doubt that prolonged grief is disabling and may require treatment. To date, few interventions have demonstrated efficacy. METHODS: We investigated whether outpatients suffering from prolonged grief disorder (PGD) benefit from a newly developed integrative cognitive behavioural therapy for prolonged grief (PG-CBT). A total of 51 patients were randomized into two groups, stratified by the type of death and their relationship to the deceased; 24 patients composed the treatment group and 27 patients composed the wait list control group (WG). Treatment consisted of 20-25 sessions. Main outcome was change in grief severity; secondary outcomes were reductions in general psychological distress and in comorbidity. RESULTS: Patients on average had 2.5 comorbid diagnoses in addition to PGD. Between group effect sizes were large for the improvement of grief symptoms in treatment completers (Cohen׳s d=1.61) and in the intent-to-treat analysis (d=1.32). Comorbid depressive symptoms also improved in PG-CBT compared to WG. The completion rate was 79% in PG-CBT and 89% in WG. LIMITATIONS: The major limitations of this study were a small sample size and that PG-CBT took longer than the waiting time. CONCLUSIONS: PG-CBT was found to be effective with an acceptable dropout rate. Given the number of bereaved people who suffer from PGD, the results are of high clinical relevance.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Cognitive immunisation against disconfirmatory evidence (i.e., devaluing expectation-disconfirming information through cognitive mechanisms) has recently been discussed as an obstacle to the revision of dysfunctional beliefs in mental disorders such as depression. Yet, it is unclear whether cognitive immunisation is also involved in belief updating in non-clinical samples. METHODS: Using a three-group modulation protocol (promotion vs. inhibition of cognitive immunisation vs. control group), we examined how cognitive immunisation influences belief updating in response to performance feedback in three non-clinical samples. In Experiments 1 (N = 99) and 2 (N = 93), participants received unexpectedly negative feedback, whereas participants from Experiment 3 (N = 118) received unexpectedly positive feedback. Depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism were examined as additional predictors of belief updating. RESULTS: In all experiments, participants adjusted their expectations in line with the feedback received, but this effect was not influenced by the cognitive immunisation manipulation. In Experiment 3, expectation change remained stable over 2 weeks. Depressive symptoms were associated with a reduced integration of positive feedback, but not with an increased sensitivity to negative feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas previous research has shown that cognitive immunisation contributes to persistent beliefs in clinical populations, the present findings suggest that it does not affect belief updating in non-clinical samples.

"Intact executive functions are characterized by flexible adaptation to task requirements, while these effects are reduced in internalizing disorders. Furthermore, as executive functions play an important role in emotion regulation, deficits in executive functions may contribute to symptom generation in psychological disorders through increased emotional interference. Thus, the present study investigated transfer effects of a three-week executive control training on adaptation to task difficulty and emotional interference in healthy participants (n = 24) to further explore the training's suitability for clinical application. To assess the adaptation to task difficulty, the proportion congruency effect on behavioral data (response times, error rates) and ERP measures (N2, CRN) was assessed in a flanker task with varying frequency of incompatible trials (25%, 75%). To quantify emotional interference, flanker stimuli were superimposed on neutral or negative pictures. Replicating previous results, the training increased interference control as indexed by decreased response times and errors rates, increased N2 amplitude and decreased CRN amplitude in incompatible trials after training. Proportion congruency effects were weaker than expected and not affected by the training intervention. The training lead to a shift in the time-point of emotional interference: before training negative pictures lead to a reduction in CRN amplitude, while after training this reduction was observed for the N2. This pattern illustrates that the training leads to a change in task processing mode from predominant response-related cognitive control to predominant stimulus-related cognitive control (N2), indicating a proactive processing mode.",0.0,0
"Previous studies associated psychopathy in adults with deficits in empathy but these studies did not directly compare cognitive and emotional facets of empathy. The present study sought to establish whether psychopathy is associated with impairments in emotional empathy among adult offenders. Participants were 90 male offenders scoring low (n = 29), medium (n = 33) or high (n = 28) on the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and n = 28 male noncriminal controls. Empathy functioning was assessed through self-report and computerized decision tasks, differentiating between perspective-taking (cognitive empathy) and compassion (emotional empathy). Against expectations, level of psychopathy among the offenders was not associated with either emotional or cognitive empathy. Offenders however had lower scores for both cognitive and emotional components of empathy functioning than controls. Both facets of empathy showed small but significant positive correlations with education level and social desirability. The methods employed to assess differences in empathy functioning may not be sensitive enough to assess differences in forensic samples.",0.0,0
"According to the transdiagnostic perspective, psychological disorders share common cognitive processes involved in their pathogenesis. One dysfunctional belief that has been found to be associated with several psychological disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), is perfectionism. Perfectionism comprises two factors, namely, perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns. This study aims to replicate and extend previous research in several ways. We aimed to assess similarities between the two disorders using Bayesian statistics. Furthermore, as dysfunctional beliefs are assumed to not be fully accessible by introspection, we included an indirect measure (perfectionism single category implicit association task; SC-IAT). The SC-IAT and a self-report measure of perfectionism (FMPS) was used in patients with MDD (n = 55), OCD (n = 55), and in healthy controls (n = 64). In replication of previous findings, patients with MDD and OCD differed from healthy controls regarding self-reported perfectionism scores. Furthermore, Bayesian statistics showed that the two patient groups did not differ regarding perfectionistic strivings and only showed differences on perfectionistic concerns, when the doubts about actions subscale-which is also closely related to symptoms of OCD-was included. Contrary to our expectations, the SC-IAT did not discriminate groups. In conclusion, these results give further evidence that self-reported perfectionism may serve as a relevant transdiagnostic process. More studies are needed to assess implicit facets of perfectionism.",0.0,0
"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by impairments in mnestic functions, especially in the domain of episodic memory. These alterations might affect different aspects of episodic memory functioning. Here we tested PTSD patients and healthy controls (matched for age, sex and education) in a newly developed virtual reality episodic memory test (VR-EMT), a test for mental time travel, episodic future thinking, and prospective memory (M3xT). In a cross-validation experiment, their performance was further evaluated in the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test (RBMT). PTSD patients demonstrated impairments in episodic memory formation and mental time travel and showed difficulties in utilizing information from episodic memory to solve problems. Diminished attention and concentration in PTSD did not account for performance deficits in these tasks but higher levels of negative arousal were found in PTSD patients. Furthermore, performance in the VR-EMT and RBMT in PTSD patients correlated negatively with self-reported measures of stress and depression. Our results suggest that deficits in episodic memory formation and mental time travel in PTSD lead to difficulties in utilizing the content of episodic memories for solving problems in the present or to plan future behavior. Clinical implications of these findings and suggestions for cognitive-behavioral treatment of PTSD are discussed.",0.0,0
"Modulating emotional responses to virtual stimuli is a fundamental goal of many immersive interactive applications. In this study, we leverage the illusion of illusory embodiment and show that owning a virtual body provides means to modulate emotional responses. In a single-factor repeated-measures experiment, we manipulated the degree of illusory embodiment and assessed the emotional responses to virtual stimuli. We presented emotional stimuli in the same environment as the virtual body. Participants experienced higher arousal, dominance, and more intense valence in the high embodiment condition compared to the low embodiment condition. The illusion of embodiment thus intensifies the emotional processing of the virtual environment. This result suggests that artificial bodies can increase the effectiveness of immersive applications psychotherapy, entertainment, computer-mediated social interactions, or health applications.",1.0,1
"Research suggested that maternal anxiety disorders might be related to infants' behavioral inhibition. This study investigated whether maternal postpartum anxiety disorder is associated with infant temperament, more precisely, infant distress to novelty, an early predictor of behavioral inhibition. Differences in the latter were analyzed in a German sample by comparing n = 38 healthy mother-infant dyads to n=44 dyads comprised of mothers diagnosed with a DSM-IV anxiety disorders. Infant age ranged from 2.83 to 7.97 months. Infant temperament was measured by means of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Mothers were screened for postpartum anxiety disorder using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders. Severity of anxiety was measured by self-reported questionnaires (Anxiety Cognition Questionnaire, Body Sensations Questionnaire and Mobility Inventory). Infant salivary cortisol reaction when being confronted with a socio-emotional stressor (Face-to-Face-Still-Face paradigm) was assessed to validate infant distress. A Mann-Whitney-U analysis suggested that infants of mothers with an anxiety disorder show more distress to novelty than infants of healthy mothers. Furthermore, data reveal a positive Spearman's rho-correlation between infant distress to novelty and maternal avoidance behavior (Mobility Inventory). A strong correlation between infant cortisol reactivity and reported distress to novelty validated the maternal evaluation of infant temperament in our sample. Results suggest a possible approach to promote infant development by encouraging mothers with anxiety symptoms to encounter feared stimuli.",1.0,1
"OBJECTIVES: Neurofeedback (NF) and self-management training (SMT) may be viable treatment options for patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) if they alleviate core symptoms, enhance the patients' self-concept and improve their quality of life (QoL). Aim of the current study is evaluating both interventions accordingly and to test whether specific improvements in core symptoms lead to more general improvements in self-concept and QoL. METHODS: In a psychotherapeutic outpatient clinic in Germany, a total of N = 139 children with ADHD were screened for eligibility, of which 111 fulfilled inclusion criteria and participated in the study in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 statement. These were randomly assigned to NF vs. SMT interventions. Changes from pre- to post-intervention in core ADHD symptoms relying on parent and teacher reports (CONNERS 3) and objective tests (Qb-Test) as well as self-concept (interview with the children) and QoL assessments (using the KINDL-R self-report) were compared between patients receiving NF or SMT. RESULTS: Significant improvements in ADHD symptoms were achieved similarly in both treatment groups, whilst QoL and self-concept improved after SMT only. CONCLUSION: This treatment study provides further evidence that SMT and NF may reduce core symptoms, but SMT may also improve patients' self-concept and QoL and may thus in its current form be the favorable treatment option in naturalistic settings. However, several limitations of the current study implicate that further research is required before definitive conclusions and recommendations for clinical practice can be given.

"To date, there is only scarce evidence for a considerable association of subjective and objective stress measures, which might be attributable to method bias (e.g., confounding) and/or asynchrony of their temporal changes. To validate different subjective stress measures by a physiological measure of long-term stress (hair cortisol concentrations; HCC), 37 heterosexual couples (N = 74) completed a 12-week internet-based assessment protocol comprised of a weekly hassle scale (WHS; once per week), a perceived stress scale (PSS; once per month), and a chronic stress scale (TICS; once after three months). Partners provided vicarious stress ratings. When averaged across time, self-reported WHS significantly predicted HCC (r = 0.27), whereas the PSS and TICS did not (r < 0.22). Dynamic factor analysis (i.e., state-space modelling) confirmed that WHS was the most valid indicator of subjective stress, explaining up to 16% of the variance in HCC (r = 0.37) with a time lag of ~4 weeks. This temporally delayed effect of subjective stress is consistent with the presumed retrospective character of HCC, but also suggests that the majority of variance in hair cortisol is attributable to other causes than subjective stress such as individual disposition to display increased adrenocortical activity.",1.0,0
"Research suggests that trauma is associated with the development of psychotic experiences, such as paranoia, via affective processes. However, the empirical evidence on the exact mechanism is limited and it is unclear which aspects of trauma are relevant. Here we tested whether self-reported frequency of trauma, recurring trauma, age, and type of trauma are predictive of later threat beliefs in daily life and which role affective processes (self-reported negative affect and autonomic arousal) play in this association. We tested two often postulated mechanisms: mediation, with affective processes in everyday life explaining the association between trauma and threat beliefs; and moderation, with trauma strengthening the association between affective processes and threat beliefs in everyday life. Trauma was assessed at baseline with the Trauma-History-Questionnaire in 67 individuals with attenuated symptoms of psychosis. We then applied the experience-sampling-method during 24 h to assess negative affect, heart rate and threat beliefs. Multilevel analysis showed that negative affect (p < 0.001) and heart rate (p < 0.05) were predictive of subsequent threat beliefs. There was no significant mediation effect from any trauma characteristic to threat beliefs via negative affect and heart rate. Trauma frequency (p < 0.001), age at first trauma (p < 0.001), as well as the presence of physical trauma (p < 0.001) moderated the path from negative affect to subsequent threat beliefs. Our findings indicate that more frequent trauma, trauma at young age and physical trauma strengthen the association from negative affect to threat beliefs and could be relevant to determining the extent of vulnerability to psychosis.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Extinction learning is proposed to be one key mechanism of action underlying exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in specific phobia. Beyond that, cognitive reappraisal, one important strategy to regulate negative emotions, is a crucial component of CBT interventions, but has been disregarded in previous studies investigating neural change processes in specific phobia. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of individual differences in habitual/dispositional cognitive reappraisal usage and the time course of brain activation during phobic stimulation in specific phobia. METHODS: Dental phobic patients and healthy control subjects participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study whilst being confronted with phobic, disgust, fear and neutral pictures. Individual differences in cognitive reappraisal usage were assessed via a self-report questionnaire and correlated with activation decreases over the course of time. RESULTS: Phobic individuals with higher dispositional cognitive reappraisal scores showed a more pronounced activation decline in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) which might be associated with a diminution of explicit cognitive emotion regulation over the course of time. Less decrease of activation in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) over time in subjects with higher cognitive reappraisal scores might be related to a stronger automatic regulation of emotions or even emotional relearning. Additionally, phobic subjects compared with healthy controls showed a stronger habituation of the left dmPFC over the course of symptom provocation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show for the first time that individual differences in cognitive reappraisal usage are associated with the time course of brain activation during symptom provocation in specific phobia. Additionally, the present study gives first indications for the importance of considering individual differences in cognitive reappraisal usage in the treatment of specific phobia.",1.0,1
"Many people surgically alter their physical appearance with the intent of boosting their social and psychological well-being; however, the long-term effectiveness of aesthetic surgery on improving well-being is unconfirmed. The present comparison-controlled study examines outcomes in a sample of 544 patients who underwent aesthetic surgery (surgery group) and 264 participants who were interested in aesthetic surgery but did not undergo it (comparison group). Participants were followed 3, 6, and 12 months after aesthetic surgery or after contacting the clinic (comparisons). Overall, the results reveal positive outcomes of receiving aesthetic surgery across areas, including anxiety, social phobia, depression, body dysmorphia, goal attainment, quality of life, life satisfaction, attractiveness, mental and physical health, well-being, self-efficacy and self-esteem. Among those dissatisfied with a particular physical feature and considering aesthetic surgery, undergoing surgery appears to result in positive self-reported psychological changes.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: In two experimental studies, we tested the hypothesis that negative mood would hinder the revision of negative beliefs in response to unexpectedly positive information in depression, whereas positive mood was expected to enhance belief updating. METHODS: In study 1 (N = 101), we used a subclinical sample to compare the film-based induction of sad v. happy mood with a distraction control group. Subsequently, participants underwent a well-established paradigm to examine intra-individual changes in performance-related expectations after unexpectedly positive performance feedback. In study 2, we applied the belief-updating task from study 1 to an inpatient sample (N = 81) and induced sad v. happy mood via film-clips v. recall of autobiographic events. RESULTS: The results of study 1 showed no significant group differences in belief updating; the severity of depressive symptoms was a negative predictor of belief revision, though, and there was a non-significant trend suggesting that the presence of sad mood hindered belief updating in the subgroup of participants with a diagnosed depressive episode. Study 2 revealed that participants updated their expectations significantly less in line with positive feedback when they underwent the induction of negative mood prior to feedback, relative to positive mood. CONCLUSIONS: By indicating that the presence of negative mood can hinder the revision of negative beliefs in clinically depressed people, our findings suggest that learning from new experiences can be hampered if state negative mood is activated. Thus, interventions relying on learning from novel positive experiences should aim at reducing state negative mood in depression.",0.0,0
"Objective: The present study investigated the role of the two theoretically derived mediators in the treatment of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD). Mediators were changes in avoidance and maladaptive cognitions. An additional hypothesis tested whether these candidate mediators are specific to CBT-based Complicated Grief Treatment (CGT) compared to Interpersonal Therapy (IPT). Method: We performed secondary analyses with assessment completers (n = 131) from a randomized-controlled trial with older adults with PGD. Patients received 16 sessions of CGT or IPT. Outcomes were treatment response and reductions in grief symptoms and grief-related related impairment. Results: Reductions in avoidance between baseline and week 16 mediated reductions in grief symptoms and grief-related impairment. Reductions in maladaptive grief-related cognitions over the same period mediated treatment response, reductions in grief symptoms and grief-related impairment. There were no significant treatment-mediator interactions. We could not establish that mediators changed before the outcomes. Conclusion: Results are consistent with theoretical models of PGD, including the CGT treatment model. Despite different therapeutic procedures, we found no significant interaction effect, but CGT produced larger effects. Future research needs to establish a timeline of change through the use of multiple measurements of mediators and outcomes.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01244295.",0.0,0
"Gaze direction and emotion expression are salient facial features that facilitate social interactions. Previous studies addressed how gaze direction influences the evaluation and recognition of emotion expressions, but few have tested how emotion expression influences attentional processing of direct versus averted gaze faces. The present study examined whether the prioritization of direct gaze (toward the observer) relative to averted gaze (away from the observer) is modulated by the emotional expression of the observed face. Participants identified targets presented on the forehead of one of four faces in a 2 x 2 design (gaze direction: direct/averted; motion: sudden/static). Emotion expressions of the faces (neutral, angry, fearful, happy, disgusted) differed across participants. Direct gaze effects emerged-response times were shorter for targets on direct gaze than on averted gaze faces. This direct gaze effect was enhanced in angry faces (approach-oriented) and reduced in fearful faces (avoidance-oriented). ""Weaker"" approach- and avoidance-oriented expressions (happy and disgusted) did not modulate the direct gaze effect. These findings suggest that the context of facial emotion expressions influences attentional processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Interoceptive accuracy and sensibility are decreased in depressive samples. However, different studies showed that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness interventions are promising approaches to improve interoceptive abilities. Based on these findings, the study aims to investigate the pre-post effect of CBT in a depressive sample. Additionally, we examined the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training in the context of CBT. METHODS: Sixty depressive patients were investigated over four weeks, with two conditions-CBT vs. CBT + MBSR. Further, the changes in interoceptive abilities (interoceptive accuracy and sensibility) of the depressive patients were compared to baseline data of healthy controls. RESULTS: The depressive patients showed significantly higher levels of depression and lower mindfulness and interoceptive abilities than healthy controls. The depressive sample showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and increased mindfulness and interoceptive abilities after CBT. Lastly, depressive patients of the CBT + MBSR condition did not differ from those who only received CBT in the levels of depression, mindfulness or interoceptive abilities over the time course. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates a positive effect of CBT on interoceptive abilities in a depressive sample. It is shown that the depressive sample did not profit from additional mindfulness training. It can be concluded that CBT is an efficient treatment, resulting in increased interoceptive abilities. Unexpectedly, the combination of CBT and MBSR has no additional effect on these changes. Future studies should investigate the effect of MBSR as a stand-alone therapy.",0.0,0
"Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most frequent psychiatric condition after stroke with a prevalence of approximately 33%. In the general population, depression is consistently reported to be more frequent in women than in men. Evidence about gender differences in PSD remains inconclusive and it is unknown if established risk factors exert gender-specific influence. The authors examined gender differences in PSD prevalence, persistence and influence of established risk factors using chi (2)- and Welch's t-tests and continuous-time structural equation modelling (CT-SEM). Patients (N = 301) from the longitudinal Berlin-PSD-study were assessed six weeks (baseline), and up to four times during the first 2.5 years post-stroke using DSM-5 depression criteria and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Established risk factors were assessed at baseline. Women showed higher PSD prevalence and severity at baseline (p < .01) but not thereafter (p >/= .43). CT-SEM analysis revealed that known risk factors predicted depression, yet predictive value and persistence did not differ between genders. Our results showed that established PSD risk factors influence both genders to a similar extent and that in contrast to depression in the general population, gender differences in PSD prevalence and severity disappeared within six months post-stroke. Thus, for reasons yet to be deciphered, gender differences in PSD appear to be time-dependent after stroke.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major life stressor posing serious threats not only to physical but also to mental health. To better understand mechanisms of vulnerability and identify individuals at risk for psychopathological symptoms in response to stressors is critical for prevention and intervention. The error-related negativity (ERN) has been discussed as a neural risk marker for psychopathology, and this study examined its predictive validity for perceived risk, stress, and psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 113 individuals who had participated as healthy control participants in previous electroencephalography studies (2014-2019) completed a follow-up online survey during the first COVID-19 wave in Germany. Associations of pre-pandemic ERN and correct-response negativity (CRN) with perceived risk regarding COVID-19 infection, stress, and internalizing symptoms during the pandemic were examined using mediation models. RESULTS: Pre-pandemic ERN and CRN were associated with increased perceived risk regarding a COVID-19 infection. Via this perceived risk, the ERN and CRN were associated with increased stress during the pandemic. Furthermore, risk perception and stress mediated indirect effects of ERN and CRN on internalizing psychopathology, including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, while controlling for the effects of pre-pandemic symptom levels. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, heightened pre-pandemic performance monitoring showed indirect associations with increases in psychopathological symptoms during the first COVID-19 wave via effects on perceived COVID-19 risk and stress. These results further strengthen the notion of performance monitoring event-related potentials as transdiagnostic neural risk markers and highlight the relevance of stress as a catalyst for symptom development.",1.0,1
"The aim of the present study was to examine the associations between self-esteem, motive satisfaction, and body weight in acute (acAN) and recovered (recAN) inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and in healthy controls. Both acAN and recAN showed lower levels of self-esteem as compared with healthy controls but did not differ from each other. In acAN, decreased body weight was associated with increased self-esteem. Satisfaction of an achievement motive but not satisfaction of a superiority motive mediated this association. No such correlations could be observed in the other groups. This is the first study to show an often assumed association between decreased body weight and increased self-esteem in AN patients. These preliminary results strengthen the assumption that low body weight may foster self-esteem in patients with acAN, mainly through the satisfaction of an achievement motive. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Self-esteem should be focused very early in the treatment of AN since weight gain may deprive the patient of an important source of self-esteem. Treatment interventions should be attuned to underlying motives of threatened self-esteem; in AN patients, the enhancement of self-esteem via weight loss seems to be rather fuelled by the satisfaction of an achievement motive than by the satisfaction of a superiority motive. Specific trainings to improve self-esteem in AN patients seem to be promising as an add-on to regular treatment.",0.0,0
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of resource-oriented variables such as self-efficacy, locus of control (LOC) and post-traumatic growth (PTG) in predicting treatment response in older adults with post-traumatic stress. METHODS: Fifty-eight older adults with subsyndromal or greater severity of war-associated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms completed a randomized controlled Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) with immediate and delayed treatment groups. Assessments of PTSD severity and resource-oriented variables of self-efficacy, LOC and PTG were conducted at baseline, post-treatment and at a 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Results revealed that pre-treatment scores on measures of internal LOC and PTG predicted PTSD symptom severity at post-treatment, even after controlling for initial PTSD. At a 6-month follow-up, internal LOC continued to predict PTSD symptom severity. In addition, repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed that, relative to older adults with low internal LOC and PTG, older adults with high internal LOC and PTG, respectively, did not differ with respect to initial PTSD severity, but they showed a more pronounced response to treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that greater locus of control and post-traumatic growth is associated with greater improvement in PTSD symptoms following Internet-based CBT. Assessment of these constructs may be useful in identifying trauma survivors who are most likely to respond to CBT. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Greater internal locus of control and post-traumatic growth is associated with greater improvement in PTSD symptoms following Internet-based CBT. Older adults with initial high internal locus of control and post-traumatic growth, respectively, did not differ with respect to initial PTSD severity, but they showed a more pronounced response to treatment. It could be assumed that patients with initial functional appraisals could benefit easier and faster from a trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy compared to individuals with lower internal locus of control and post-traumatic growth.",0.0,0
"Two adaptations of the Implicit Association Task were used to assess implicit anxiety (IAT-Anxiety) and implicit health attitudes (IAT-Hypochondriasis) in patients with hypochondriasis (n = 58) and anxiety patients (n = 71). Explicit anxieties and health attitudes were assessed using questionnaires. The analysis of several multitrait-multimethod models indicated that the low correlation between explicit and implicit measures of health attitudes is due to the substantial methodological differences between the IAT and the self-report questionnaire. Patients with hypochondriasis displayed significantly more dysfunctional explicit and implicit health attitudes than anxiety patients, but no differences were found regarding explicit and implicit anxieties. The study demonstrates the specificity of explicit and implicit dysfunctional health attitudes among patients with hypochondriasis.",0.0,0
"As rescue workers are regularly confronted with potentially traumatising on-duty events, they have an increased risk to develop trauma-related mental and physical health impairments, including post-traumatic, depressive, and somatic symptoms. For this high-risk group, it could be of particular importance to experience their occupational burden as manageable, meaningful, and coherent. This mindset - called sense of coherence - may be a potential resilience factor against the development of mental and physical health problems. In a cross-sectional cohort of 102 rescue workers (Mdn(QD)(age) = 26.0 (8.5), age range: 18-61), including 36 women, we investigated whether higher values on the Revised Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-R) predicted lower post-traumatic, depressive, and somatic symptoms. In addition, we evaluated the factor structure of the SOC-R using confirmatory factor analyses. Linear regressions indicated that higher SOC-R, but particularly manageability scores were associated with less post-traumatic (beta = -.31, p = .009), depressive (beta = -.44, p < .001), and somatic symptoms (beta = -.36, p = .002). Furthermore, we found that all symptom scores significantly increased with occupational and private-life trauma exposure. The SOC-R's factor structure was replicated, comprising the three subscales manageability, reflection, and balance. However, the SOC-R's convergent factor validity was rather low in the present sample. Taken together, a high sense of coherence, and in particular a high manageability conviction, was observed as resilience factors for high-risk groups that are frequently exposed to potentially traumatic events. Future studies might investigate whether strengthening the sense of coherence could be one building block in an effective prevention program for maintaining long-term health in risk groups.",1.0,0
"Overweight and obese individuals are at greater risk for the development of a major depressive disorder. A main factor contributing to negative affect in obese women is body-related worrying. Given the potential benefits of various emotion regulation (ER) strategies in the modification of negative affect, the aim of the present study was to test whether experimentally-induced body dissatisfaction can be modified by ER strategies in obese women. Body dissatisfaction was experimentally induced in a group of 37 obese women using model pictures. Following this, participants were randomly assigned to two different ER strategies: rumination on present emotions and thoughts, or acceptance of whatever thoughts and feelings come up. Weight and appearance satisfaction, distress about body feelings and mood were assessed both prior to, immediately after, and 4 min after the induction. Psychophysiological parameters were assessed continuously. The main results reveal that after the use of ER strategies, weight and appearance satisfaction returned to baseline levels. However, in the rumination condition, distress about body feelings remained above and mood below baseline. In the acceptance condition distress and mood returned to baseline levels. The results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of ER strategies with regard to reducing body-related distress.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Work capacity demands are a concept to describe which psychological capacities are required in a job. Assessing psychological work capacity demands is of specific importance when mental health problems at work endanger work ability. Exploring psychological work capacity demands is the basis for mental hazard analysis or rehabilitative action, e.g. in terms of work adjustmentOBJECTIVE:This is the first study investigating psychological work capacity demands in rehabilitation patients with and without mental disorders. METHODS: A structured interview on psychological work capacity demands (Mini-ICF-Work; Muschalla, 2015; Linden et al., 2015) was done with 166 rehabilitation patients of working age. All interviews were done by a state-licensed socio-medically trained psychotherapist. Inter-rater-reliability was assessed by determining agreement in independent co-rating in 65 interviews. For discriminant validity purposes, participants filled in the Short Questionnaire for Work Analysis (KFZA, Prumper et al., 1994). RESULTS: In different professional fields, different psychological work capacity demands were of importance. The Mini-ICF-Work capacity dimensions reflect different aspects than the KFZA. Patients with mental disorders were longer on sick leave and had worse work ability prognosis than patients without mental disorders, although both groups reported similar work capacity demands. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological work demands - which are highly relevant for work ability prognosis and work adjustment processes - can be explored and differentiated in terms of psychological capacity demands.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Removal of the olfactory bulb (OB) leads to depression like behavior in rodents. A link between depression and olfactory function is also established in humans. We hypothesized that the human OB volume relates to depressive state and tested whether such a potential coherence is moderated by structural alterations in other brain regions. METHODS: Eighty-three participants (32 patients with major depression and 51 matched healthy controls) underwent structural MR scanning. Individual OB volumes were compared between patients and controls and the impact of depression and comorbidity was analyzed with multiple regression analysis. Whole-brain voxel-based morphometry revealed structures co-varying with both depressive state and OB volume. RESULTS: The OB volume of patients was significantly reduced and this reduction averaged out at 17% compared to the controls. The OB volume was correlated to the volume of the insula, superior temporal cortex, and amygdala. The independent variables of depression (beta = -.37), age (beta = -.25), and gender (beta = -.40) explained the individual OB volume variation (R(2) = .37). The correlation between OB volume and depression was moderated by volumetric reductions in a cluster including the insula and superior temporal gyrus (STG). CONCLUSIONS: The OB volume relates to depression in humans and to the volume of structures which are critical for salience detection. We assume that a reduced OB volume causes diminished neural olfactory input which facilitates volume reduction in the insula and STG. The OB volume may hence constitute a factor of vulnerability to depression. Olfactory-based deep brain stimulation is discussed as a future therapeutic approach.",1.0,1
"In a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) we evaluated an inpatient psychodynamic treatment for adolescents suffering from mixed disorders of conduct and emotions. The sample consisted of severely impaired adolescents with remarkable deficits regarding psychic structure. The current study wanted to examine if the manualized treatment did not only reduce symptoms but also enhance the structural level of the patients. The axis structure of the Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics in Childhood and Adolescence (OPD-CA) was used to assess the structural level of N = 46 adolescent inpatients. To examine differences between the patients' structural level at the beginning and at the end of inpatient treatment we conducted a repeated measures ANOVA. The overall score as well as the three subscores of the axis structure improved significantly during inpatient treatment. The corresponding effect sizes were large (eta(2) = .29 to .47). The inpatient psychodynamic treatment led to significant improvements regarding symptomatology as well as psychic structure. However, further studies with larger sample size and control group data should be conducted to confirm these results.",1.0,1
"Avoidance behavior is a core symptom of anxiety disorders that may hinder adaptation. Anxiety disorders are heterogeneous and previous research suggests to decompose anxiety into two dimensions: anxious apprehension and anxious arousal. How these two dimensions are associated with avoidance of and exposure to threatening stimuli, as well as their accompanying neural processes, is barely understood. We examined threat processing using event-related potentials (N1, LPP) from 134 individuals considering the influence of anxiety dimensions. During a two-phase picture-viewing task the participants watched neutral and threatening pictures, which they were instructed to either avoid or attend to during repeated presentations. Results showed that threatening compared to neutral pictures were associated with increased attention allocation (N1) and in-depth processing (LPP), modulated by task-instructions (lower during avoidance). Further, increased anxious apprehension was associated with heightened automatic attention (increased N1), followed by reduced LPP amplitudes for threatening pictures suggesting reduced in-depth processing. During re-exposure, threatening pictures were associated with increased in-depth processing, with no difference between previously avoided and maintained pictures. Together, these results illustrate that avoidance and high anxious apprehension seem to lead to similar neural changes in the processing of aversive images that may conflict with long-term adaptation.",0.0,0
"The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of maternal postpartum depression and/or anxiety disorders according to DMS-IV on maternal self-confidence throughout infancy and early childhood. Exploratively, associations between maternal attachment insecurity and maternal self-confidence at pre-school age were examined. The sample (N = 54) of this prospective longitudinal study was comprised of n = 27 women with postpartum depression and/or anxiety disorders according to DSM-IV criteria and n = 27 healthy women without present or history of mental health disorders or psychotherapy. Data was collected in the postpartum period (M = 60.08 days) and at pre-school age (M = 4.7 years). Subjects were recruited between 2004 and 2011 in South Germany. Data revealed a significant difference in maternal self-confidence between clinical and control group at child's pre-school age: Women with postpartum depression and/or anxiety disorder scored lower on maternal self-confidence than healthy controls, but only if they had current SCID-diagnoses or partly remitted symptoms. According to explorative analyses maternal attachment insecurity turned out to be the strongest predictor of maternal self-confidence at pre-school age besides maternal mental health status. The results emphasize the impact of attachment insecurity and maternal mental health regarding maternal self-confidence leading to potential adverse long-term consequences for the mother-child relationship. Attachment based interventions taking maternal self-confidence into account are needed.",1.0,1
"Previous research found that memory is not only better for emotional information but also for neutral information that has been encoded in the context of an emotional event. In the present ERP study, we investigated two factors that may influence memory for neutral and emotional items: temporal proximity between emotional and neutral items during encoding, and retention interval (immediate vs. delayed). Forty-nine female participants incidentally encoded 36 unpleasant and 108 neutral pictures (36 neutral pictures preceded an unpleasant picture, 36 followed an unpleasant picture, and 36 neutral pictures were preceded and followed by neutral pictures) and participated in a recognition memory task either immediately (N = 24) or 1 week (N = 25) after encoding. Results showed better memory for emotional pictures relative to neutral pictures. In accordance, enhanced centroparietal old/new differences (500-900 ms) during recognition were observed for unpleasant compared to neutral pictures, most pronounced for the 1-week interval. Picture position effects, however, were only subtle. During encoding, late positive potentials for neutral pictures were slightly lower for neutral pictures following unpleasant ones, but only at trend level. To summarize, we could replicate and extend previous ERP findings showing that emotionally arousing events are better recollected than neutral events, particularly when memory is tested after longer retention intervals. Picture position during encoding, however, had only small effects on elaborative processing and no effects on memory retrieval.",1.0,0
"This is the first study to investigate multiple cognitive biases in adolescence simultaneously, to examine whether anxiety and depression are associated with biases in attention and interpretation, and whether these biases are able to predict unique variance in self-reported levels of anxiety and depression. A total of 681 adolescents performed a Dot Probe Task (DPT), an Emotional Visual Search Task (EVST), and an Interpretation Recognition Task. Attention and interpretation biases were significantly correlated with anxiety. Mixed results were reported with regard to depression: evidence was found for an interpretation bias, and for an attention bias as measured with the EVST but not with the DPT. Furthermore, interpretation and attention biases predicted unique variance in anxiety and depression scores. These results indicate that attention and interpretation biases are unique processes in anxiety and depression. They also suggest that anxiety and depression are partly based on similar underlying cognitive mechanisms.",0.0,0
"Basic research has shown that the motoric system (i.e., motor actions or stable postures) can strongly affect emotional processes. The present study sought to investigate the effects of sitting posture on the tendency of depressed individuals to recall a higher proportion of negative self-referent material. Thirty currently depressed inpatients either sat in a slumped (depressed) or in an upright (non-depressed) posture while imagining a visual scene of themselves in connection with positive or depression related words presented to them on a computer screen. An incidental recall test of these words was conducted after a distraction task. Results of a mixed ANOVA showed a significant posture x word type interaction, with upright-sitting patients showing unbiased recall of positive and negative words but slumped patients showing recall biased towards more negative words. The findings indicate that relatively minor changes in the motoric system can affect one of the best-documented cognitive biases in depression. Practical implications of the findings are discussed.",1.0,1
"In psychosis, the alleged increased subjective stress-sensitivity is reflected in abnormal physiological arousal such as higher heart rate, elevated skin conductance levels, decreased vagal activity, and unusual cortisol levels. Despite ongoing research, possible mechanisms that explain the interplay between the phenomenological (i.e., subjective stress and symptoms) and psychophysiological processes are not thoroughly understood. Building on the model of neurovisceral integration by Thayer and Lane (2000) that focuses on regulative mechanisms, we postulate that emotion regulation will be associated with vagal activity, and with both subjective and physiological stress. In the present analysis, we used data from a baseline relaxation period including a 5-minute assessment of heart rate variability (HRV), salivary cortisol, and momentary subjective stress ratings from a sample of 19 participants with psychosis (mean age=40.9, SD=11.1; 36.8% female). Emotion regulation modification skills were assessed for specific emotions (i.e., stress and arousal, anxiety, anger, sadness, shame) if these were present during the previous week. Vagal HRV was significantly and moderately associated with emotion regulation. Both stress parameters (i.e., cortisol, subjective stress) were significantly associated with emotion regulation, but not with HRV. We provide preliminary support for the notion that emotion regulatory processes represent a crucial link between phenomenological and psychophysiological phenomena in psychosis. A potential model that ascribes emotion regulation a central role in the restoration of homeostasis is discussed. Future studies are needed to verify its generalizability and predictive value.",0.0,0
"From the age of 3 months, infants learn relations between objects and co-occurring words [1]. These very first representations of object-word pairings in infant memory are considered as non-symbolic proto-words comprising specific visual-auditory associations that can already be formed in the first months of life [2-5]. Genuine words that refer to semantic long-term memory have not been evidenced prior to 9 months of age [6-9]. Sleep is known to facilitate the reorganization of memories [9-14], but its impact on the perceptual-to-semantic trend in early development is unknown. Here we explored the formation of word meanings in 6- to 8-month-old infants and its reorganization during the course of sleep. Infants were exposed to new words as labels for new object categories. In the memory test about an hour later, generalization to novel category exemplars was tested. In infants who took a short nap during the retention period, a brain response of 3-month-olds [1] was observed, indicating generalizations based on early developing perceptual-associative memory. In those infants who napped longer, a semantic priming effect [15, 16] usually found later in development [17-19] revealed the formation of genuine words. The perceptual-to-semantic shift in memory was related to the duration of sleep stage 2 and to locally increased sleep spindle activity. The finding that, after the massed presentation of several labeled category exemplars, sleep enabled even 6-month-olds to create semantic long-term memory clearly challenges the notion that immature brain structures are responsible for the typically slower lexical development.",1.0,1
"Any experienced event may be encoded and retained in detail as part of our episodic memory, and may also refer and contribute to our generalized knowledge stored in semantic memory. The beginnings of this declarative memory formation are only poorly understood. Even less is known about the interrelation between episodic and semantic memory during the earliest developmental stages. Here, we show that the formation of episodic memories in 14- to 17-month-old infants depends on sleep, subsequent to exposure to novel events. Infant brain responses reveal that, after sleep-dependent consolidation, the newly stored events are not processed semantically, although appropriate lexical-semantic memories are present and accessible by similar events that were not experienced before the nap. We propose that temporarily disabled semantic processing protects precise episodic memories from interference with generalized semantic memories. Selectively restricted semantic access could also trigger semantic refinement, and thus, might even improve semantic memory.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: While studies with survivors of single traumatic experiences highlight individual response variation following trauma, research from conflict regions shows that almost everyone develops posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if trauma exposure reaches extreme levels. Therefore, evaluating the effects of cumulative trauma exposure is of utmost importance in studies investigating risk factors for PTSD. Yet, little research has been devoted to evaluate how this important environmental risk factor can be best quantified. METHODS: We investigated the retest reliability and predictive validity of different trauma measures in a sample of 227 Ugandan rebel war survivors. Trauma exposure was modeled as the number of traumatic event types experienced or as a score considering traumatic event frequencies. In addition, we investigated whether age at trauma exposure can be reliably measured and improves PTSD risk prediction. RESULTS: All trauma measures showed good reliability. While prediction of lifetime PTSD was most accurate from the number of different traumatic event types experienced, inclusion of event frequencies slightly improved the prediction of current PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: As assessing the number of traumatic events experienced is the least stressful and time-consuming assessment and leads to the best prediction of lifetime PTSD, we recommend this measure for research on PTSD etiology.",1.0,1
"The pervasiveness of explicit and implicit weight bias (WB) defined as negative stereotypes and prejudice regarding one's weight has been observed among individuals of all weight categories. As a source of WB, health messages have been discussed due to reinforcing stigmatizing notions. The present study sought to investigate whether health messages (i.e., eat healthy, become physically active) have the potential to increase explicit and implicit WB. Participants (N = 144) from the community were randomized to either an experimental group (EG) or a control group (CG). While the EG was presented with health messages, the CG was presented with neutral information. Before and after manipulation, participants completed measures of explicit and implicit WB. Paired samples t-test revealed no differences in explicit WB after manipulation, however, a small effect decrease of implicit WB in the EG but not in the CG was found. This study provided evidence that health messages might have differential impact to change WB. According to dual-model approaches, explicit and implicit WB tap into two different information processing systems, and thus were differentially affected by health messages. Brief exposure to health messages might have the potential to contribute to health behavior and to mitigate implicit WB.",0.0,0
"The present study evaluates a brief, cross-cultural scale that maps a wide range of social resources, useful in large-scale assessments of perceived social support. The Brief Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (Fragebogen zur Sozialen Unterstutzung Kurzform mit sechs Items, F-SozU K-6) was examined in representative and university student samples from the United States (N(representative) = 3038), Germany (N(representative) = 2007, N(student) = 5406), Russia (N(representative) = 3020, N(student) = 4001), and China (N(student) = 13,582). Cross-cultural measurement invariance testing was conducted in both representative and student samples across countries. Scores on the F-SozU K-6 demonstrated good reliability and strong model fit for a unidimensional structure in all samples, with the exception of poor model fit for German students. The scores on F-SozU K-6 correlated negatively with scores on depression, anxiety, and stress measures and positively with scores on positive mental health measures. Norms for gender and age groups were established separately based on each representative sample. Cross-cultural measurement invariance testing found partial strong measurement invariance across three general population samples and three student samples. Furthermore, a simulation study showed that the amount of invariance observed in the partial invariance model had only a negligible impact on mean comparisons. Psychometric findings across diverse cultural contexts supported the robustness and validity of the F-SozU K-6 for cross-cultural epidemiologic studies.

"The animal and blood-injection-injury (BII) subtypes of specific phobia are both characterized by subjective fear but distinct autonomic reactions to threat. Previous functional neuroimaging studies have related these characteristic responses to shared and non-shared neural underpinnings. However, no comparative structural data are available. This study aims to fill this gap by comparing the two subtypes and also comparing them with a non-phobic control group. Gray and white matter data of 33 snake phobia subjects (SP), 26 dental phobia subjects (DP), and 37 healthy control (HC) subjects were analyzed with voxel-based morphometry. Especially DP differed from HC and SP by showing significantly increased grey matter volumes in widespread areas including the right subgenual anterior cingulate gyrus, left insula, left orbitofrontal and left prefrontal (PFC) cortices. In addition, white matter volume was significantly increased in the left PFC in DP compared with SP. These results are in line with functional changes observed in dental phobia and point toward those brain circuits associated with emotional processing and regulation. Future studies should aim to further delineate functional and structural connectivity alterations in specific phobia.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Social rejection elicits negative mood, emotional distress, and neural activity in networks that are associated with physical pain. However, studies assessing physiological reactions to social rejection are rare and results of these studies were found to be ambiguous. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine and specify physiological effects of social rejection. METHODS: Participants (n = 50) were assigned to either a social exclusion or inclusion condition of a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Immediate and delayed physiological [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate] reactions were recorded. In addition, subjects reported levels of affect, emotional states, and fundamental needs. RESULTS: Subjects who were socially rejected showed increased heart rates. However, social rejection had no effect on subjects' SCLs. Both conditions showed heightened arousal on this measurement. Furthermore, psychological consequences of social rejection indicated the validity of the paradigm. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that social rejection evokes an immediate physiological reaction. Accelerated heart rates indicate that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. In addition, results revealed gender-specific response patterns suggesting that sample characteristics such as differences in gender may account for ambiguous findings of physiological reactions to social rejection.",0.0,0
"While the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) approaches for childhood functional abdominal pain (FAP) is well-established for child outcomes, only a few studies have reported on parent-specific outcomes. This randomized controlled pilot trial analyzed effects of a group CBT on maternal variables (i.e., pain-related behavior, worries and self-efficacy, as well as general psychosocial strain). Methods: The sample constituted of 15 mothers in the intervention group (IG) and 14 mothers in the waitlist control group (WLC). Outcome measures were assessed pre-treatment, post-treatment and at three months follow-up. Results: Analyses revealed significant, large changes in maladaptive maternal reactions related to the child's abdominal pain in the IG compared to the WLC-i.e., reduced attention (d = 0.95), medical help-seeking (d = 0.92), worries (d = 1.03), as well as a significant increase in behaviors that encourage the child's self-management (d = 1.03). In addition, maternal self-efficacy in dealing with a child's pain significantly increased in the IG as well (d = 0.92). Treatment effects emerged post-treatment and could be maintained until three months follow-up. There were no effects on general self-efficacy and maternal quality of life. Conclusion: While these results are promising, and underline the efficacy of the CBT approach for both the child and mothers, further studies, including long-term follow-ups, are warranted.",1.0,0
"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients show hyperactive performance monitoring when monitoring their own actions. Hyperactive performance monitoring is related to OCD symptomatology, like the unflexibility of compulsive behaviors, and was suggested as a potential endophenotype for the disorder. However, thus far the functioning of the performance monitoring system in OCD remains unclear in processes where performance is not monitored in one's own actions internally, but through external feedback during learning. The present study investigated whether electrocortical indicators of feedback processing are hyperactive, and whether feedback-guided learning is compromised in OCD. A modified deterministic four-choice object reversal learning task was used that required recurrent feedback-based behavioral adjustment in response to changing reward contingencies. Electrophysiological correlates of feedback processing (i.e. feedback-related negativity [FRN] and P300) were measured in 25 OCD patients and 25 matched healthy comparison subjects. Deficits in behavioral adjustment were found in terms of higher error rates of OCD patients in response to negative feedback. Whereas the FRN was unchanged for reversal negative feedback, it was reduced for negative feedback that indicated that a newly selected stimulus was still incorrect. The observed FRN reduction suggests attenuated monitoring of feedback during the learning process in OCD potentially contributing to a deficit in adaptive behavior reflected in obsessive thoughts and actions. The reduction of FRN amplitudes contrasts with overactive performance monitoring of self-generated errors. Nevertheless, the findings contribute to the theoretical framework of performance monitoring, suggesting a dissociation of processing systems for actions and feedback with specific alterations of these two systems in OCD.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Aversive mental images of contracting or having a severe disease are assumed to contribute to the development and maintenance of health anxiety (HA) via the elicitation of fear, arousal and defensive mobilization. The current COVID-19 pandemic is known to trigger fears of contracting COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we used an experimental approach to investigate whether COVID-19-related mental images lead to a fearful response and whether this is associated with levels of HA. 139 participants vividly imagined neutral, standard fear and COVID-19 related narrative scenes. RESULTS: Standard fear and COVID-19 scripts prompted higher anxiety, arousal, displeasure and avoidance tendencies as compared to neutral scripts. HA was associated with higher anxiety, arousal, displeasure, imagery vividness and stronger avoidance tendencies during imagery of COVID-19 scenes. No associations were found for anxiety sensitivity, trait anxiety as well as depressive and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, there was no association of HA with emotional responses during imagery of standard fear scenes. LIMITATIONS: Fear responses were assessed via verbal reports. Future studies should also assess behavioral and physiological correlates of fear. CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that individuals with high levels of HA are prone to fearful mental imagery of contracting COVID-19 which might be crucial factor contributing to the exacerbation and chronicity of excessive HA in times of a pandemic.",0.0,0
"Food restriction and weight-loss have been proposed to represent pathogenic mechanisms of emotion regulation in anorexia nervosa (AN). However, there is a lack of studies empirically examining this hypothesis. Therefore, the present study compared 25 women with AN and 25 healthy control women (HC) regarding spontaneous emotional processing of autobiographic memories. Participants' idiographic memories of sad autobiographic events were analyzed using computerized, quantitative text analysis as an unobtrusive approach of nonreactive assessment. Compared to HC, AN patients retrieved more negative but a comparable number of positive emotions. Moreover, the lesser the body weight in AN patients, the lesser negative emotions they retrieved, irrespective of current levels of depressive symptoms and duration of illness. No such association was found in HC. These preliminary findings are in line with models of AN proposing that food restriction and weight-loss may be negatively reinforced by the alleviation of aversive emotional responses.",0.0,0
"Regulation of craving (ROC) is a promising method of intervention in addiction and has received attention in event-related potential (ERP) research investigating the late positive potential (LPP). However, in the face of previously unaligned behavioral and LPP results, the present work aimed to take a first step toward more valid electrocortical markers of ROC. Twenty-seven smokers (16 female), abstinent from smoking for 3 h prior to testing, viewed smoking-related pictures while EEG was recorded. During picture viewing, participants were asked to either imagine the short-term benefits (NOW condition) or long-term negative consequences (LATER condition) of smoking, or engage in an arithmetic task (DISTRACT condition). After each picture, participants indicated picture-related subjective craving. In addition to analyzing classic ERPs, we employed single-trial multiple robust regression within subjects to relate EEG activity at each time point and electrode to trial-wise craving ratings. Craving was lower in the LATER and DISTRACT than the NOW condition. LPP amplitudes (300-1000 ms at centro-parietal electrodes) were lower in the DISTRACT but not the LATER compared to the NOW condition. Trial-wise craving was captured between 500 and 1100 ms and around 2400 ms at central midline and left sites for DISTRACT and associated with a very brief and local signal (~900 ms; at C3) for LATER. This replicates the mismatch between self-reported craving and LPP. Single-trial results suggest that the correlates of ROC are not entirely compatible with the focus on centro-parietal slow waves (i.e. the LPP) and that different strategies of ROC are characterized by distinct electrocortical markers.",0.0,0
"The predominant focus in attachment research on trait-like individual differences has overshadowed investigation of the ways in which working models of attachment represent dynamic, interpersonally responsive socio-affective systems. Intensive longitudinal designs extend previous work by evaluating to what extent attachment varies over social interactions and the functional processes that underlie its fluctuation. We examined momentary activation of attachment orientations in the stream of peoples' daily lives and how those patterns were linked to interpersonal behavior. Based on an event-contingent, ambulatory 7-day assessment protocol (N=263; 3,971 interactions) operationalized using Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory, we examined whether contextually activated working models accounted for patterns of interpersonal (anti-)complementarity. Our analyses revealed that the situational activation of working models varied as a function of interpersonal perceptions of warmth, which were linked to greater state security and lower levels of anxious or avoidant expectations. These reactivity patterns, in turn, accounted for interpersonal complementarity. Avoidant attachment was linked to diminished and secure attachment to enhanced expressions of warmth. The analyses were robust even when controlling for momentary positive and negative affect and closeness of the relationship. Attachment expectations wax and wane across daily social interactions, and such fluctuations are reflective primarily of a process in which perceptions of others' warmth activate secure attachment expectations and lower insecure ones.

"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: This intervention study evaluates the short- and long-term effects of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in groups for school-age children and their parents, named the KiSS-program. CBT-I was implemented in three sessions for children and three sessions for parents. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: All in all, 112 children with chronic childhood insomnia were randomly assigned to a wait-list (WL) control or treatment condition. RESULTS: According to subjective measures as well as objective wrist actigraphy, children in the CBT-I condition reported greater improvements in sleep behavior immediately after the treatment compared to the WL group. Improvements in sleep behavior after CBT-I persisted over the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first randomized controlled trial that provides evidence for the long-term effectiveness of CBT-I in treating school-age children with chronic insomnia.",1.0,1
"Research increasingly assesses momentary changes in paranoia in order to elucidate causal mechanisms. Observed or manipulated changes in postulated causal factors should result in fluctuations in state paranoid ideation. Previous studies often employed a state-adapted Paranoia Checklist (Freeman et al., 2005) to measure state paranoia. This study examined whether the Paranoia Checklist or subsets of its items are appropriate for this purpose. Thirteen studies (N=860) were subjected to meta-analyses of each Paranoia Checklist item. We selected items based on (1) whether they showed pre-to-post change in the expected direction and (2) whether this effect was larger in experimental vs. control conditions. All resulting item selections were cross-validated on a hold-out sample (n=1893). Finally, we explored how much variation in paranoia was captured by the state-adapted version in a brief ambulatory assessment study (N=32). A thirteen item State Paranoia Checklist as well as a five item and a three item Brief State Paranoia Checklist were extracted. Cross validation revealed better model fit and increased sensitivity to change. Multilevel analysis indicated 25-30% of the variance in the Brief State Paranoia Checklists to be due to intra-individual daily fluctuations in paranoia. Our analyses produced reliable and valid revised scales. Increases in change sensitivity indicate that future assessment of state paranoia in experimental and ambulatory assessment studies can be optimized by using the revised scales.",1.0,1
"The goal of this study was to examine the effects of Cognitive Bias Modification training for Interpretation (CBM-I) in socially anxious adolescents with Mild Intellectual Disabilities (MID). A total of 69 socially anxious adolescents with MID were randomly assigned to either a positive or a neutral control-CMB-I-training. Training included five sessions in a 3-week period, and each session consisted of 40 training items. Adolescents in the positive training group showed a significant reduction in negative interpretation bias on the two interpretation bias tasks after training compared to adolescents in the control-training group. Furthermore, in contrast to the control-training group, adolescents in the positive training reported a significant reduction of their social anxiety symptoms 10 weeks post-training.",1.0,1
"Since the COVID-19 outbreak, digital gaming has become a welcome pastime and distraction for many people. However, this phenomenon can have severe consequences; intensive digital gaming can foster the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and negatively affect mental health. The present experimental longitudinal study investigated the consequences of a conscious abstinence from gaming in a German sample. The experimental group ( N = 131; age: M = 26.21, SD = 7.70) did not engage in gaming for two weeks; the control group ( N = 140; age: M = 25.10, SD = 4.94) maintained its gaming time and habits. Gaming-related variables and mental health-related variables were assessed via online surveys at five measurement time points (baseline, intermediate status, post-intervention, one-month follow-up, three-month follow-up). The intervention significantly reduced gaming time, gaming flow, IGD, daily stress, and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, we found a significant improvement in positive mental health. The effects were stable over the three months of the investigation. Thus, we could show that a conscious and controlled, short-term abstinence from gaming leads to reduced IGD and a better mental health. The present results emphasize that conscious periods of gaming abstinence could be an effective step in the clinical context and in mental health prevention programs, especially during a pandemic such as the COVID-19 outbreak. • Two-week gaming-abstinence reduces gaming time and gaming flow longitudinally. • Two-week gaming-abstinence reduces the level of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). • Two-week gaming-abstinence reduces the experience of daily stress and anxiety symptoms. • Two-week gaming-abstinence increases positive mental health. • Temporary gaming-abstinence can protect mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.",1.0,1
"The objective was to examine the efficacy of Applied Relaxation (AR) as indicated preventive intervention to reduce psychopathological symptoms and prevent incident mental disorders. In a parallel-group randomized controlled trial, N = 277 adults with elevated tension/distress, anxiety, or depressive symptomatology (Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale, DASS-21) but no 12-month DSM-5 diagnosis of any mental disorder assessed via standardized interview (DIA-X-5) were randomized to an intervention group (IG; n = 139) receiving group-based AR training, or an assessment-only control group (CG, n = 138). Self-report questionnaires at baseline, post (immediately after the 10 week intervention or a similar time frame in CG) and 12-month follow-up included the DASS-21 as primary outcome measure of intervention efficacy. Incident subthreshold and threshold mental disorders were assessed via DIA-X-5 at 12-month follow-up as primary outcome of prevention efficacy. Intervention and prevention effects were examined on an intent-to-treat basis with missing data replaced using chained multiple imputation. Mixed-model analyses revealed accelerated symptom improvement in IG versus CG with a medium baseline-to-post between-group effect size (d = 0.59, 95%CI: 0.36-0.82). Logistic regression analysis revealed a significantly lower incidence rate for (sub-)threshold mental disorders until 12-month follow-up in IG (34.7%) versus CG (49.3%; Odds Ratio: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.31-0.92, Risk Ratio: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.51-0.96, Risk Difference = -0.15, 95%CI: -0.28 to -0.02). Group-based AR as a promising indicative preventive intervention should be tested in long-term studies and relative to a credible alternative intervention to assure that the intervention effects are not entirely due to demand characteristics, expectancies, or non-specific effects.",1.0,1
"Positive affect is related to cognitive performance in multiple ways. It is associated with motivational aspects of performance, affective states capture attention, and information processing modes are a function of affect. In this study, we examined whether these links are relevant within individuals across time when they experience minor ups and downs of positive affect and work on cognitive tasks in the laboratory on a day-to-day basis. Using a microlongitudinal design, 101 younger adults (20-31 years of age) worked on 3 working memory tasks on about 100 occasions. Every day, they also reported on their momentary affect and their motivation to work on the tasks. In 2 of the 3 tasks, performance was enhanced on days when positive affect was above average. This performance enhancement was also associated with more motivation. Importantly, increases in task performance on days with above-average positive affect were mainly unrelated to variations in negative affect. This study's results are in line with between-person findings suggesting that high levels of well-being are associated with successful outcomes. They imply that success on cognitively demanding tasks is more likely on days when feeling happier.",0.0,0
"Clark and Wells' prominent model of social anxiety disorder (SAD) assumes that cognitive variables such as negative expectations or dysfunctional cognitions play a central role in the symptomatology of SAD. In contrast to adults, it is less clear how well the cognitive model can be applied to children and adolescents. A network analysis with seven nodes was conducted to explore the importance of cognitive variables and their interaction with symptoms of SAD based on N = 205 children and adolescents (8-18 years, M = 11.54 years). Cognitive variables had a high but differential impact within the positively connected network of SAD. Dysfunctional cognitions were most strongly connected within the network. Dysfunctional cognitions, as predicted by Clark and Wells' model, seem to act as a hub affecting several symptoms. The association between negative expectations and avoidance indicates that negative expectations may particularly contribute to the maintenance of SAD.",1.0,1
"The Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) was developed to measure core concepts of behavioural activation for depression. A number of studies, mostly based on analogue samples, have provided initial support for the BADS. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties of the German version of the scale more broadly, including change sensitivity and clinical treatment data. A mixed sample of students (N = 312) and depressed outpatients in partial remission undergoing cognitive-behavioural group treatment for depressive rumination (N = 59) was examined. To analyze construct validity, a set of theoretically relevant constructs such as perseverative thinking, distraction and mindfulness was also assessed. Results indicated good psychometric properties, additional evidence for construct validity of the total scale and subscales, and adequate fit of the data to the original factor structure. Furthermore, the BADS proved to be sensitive to changes in participants undergoing treatment for depression. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Behavioural activation (BA) is an effective treatment for patients suffering from unipolar depression. The Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) can be used to measure core elements of the BA treatment rationale. It is useful to track changes in activation within treatment. The BADS is available in different languages and has shown to possess good psychometric properties.",1.0,1
"Learning accounts of addiction and obesity emphasize the persistent power of Pavlovian reward cues to trigger craving and increase relapse risk. While extinction can reduce conditioned responding, Pavlovian relapse phenomena-the return of conditioned responding following successful extinction-challenge the long-term success of extinction-based treatments. Translational laboratory models of Pavlovian relapse could therefore represent a valuable tool to investigate the mechanisms mediating relapse, although so far human research has mostly focused on return of fear phenomena. To this end we developed an appetitive conditioning paradigm with liquid food rewards in combination with a 3-day design to investigate the return of appetitive Pavlovian responses and the involved neural structures in healthy subjects. Pavlovian conditioning (day 1) was assessed in 62 participants, and a subsample (n = 33) further completed extinction (day 2) and a reinstatement test (day 3). Conditioned responding was assessed on explicit (pleasantness ratings) and implicit measures (reaction time, skin conductance, heart rate, startle response) and reinstatement effects were further evaluated using fMRI. We observed a return of conditioned responding during the reinstatement test, evident by enhanced skin conductance responses, accompanied by enhanced BOLD responses in the amygdala. On an individual level, psychophysiological reinstatement intensity was significantly anticorrelated with ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation, and marginally anticorrelated with enhanced amygdala-vmPFC connectivity during late reinstatement. Our results extend evidence from return of fear phenomena to the appetitive domain, and highlight the role of the vmPFC and its functional connection with the amygdala in regulating appetitive Pavlovian relapse.",0.0,1
"The agreement of subjective and genital sexual response, also referred to as sexual concordance, shows substantial variability between women. Identifying predictors of sexual arousal and sexual concordance is important to improve our understanding of female sexual response and its relationship to sexual function or dysfunction. The aim of this study was to assess the relevance of sexual excitation and sexual inhibition as predictors of subjective sexual arousal, genital arousal, and sexual concordance. In a laboratory setting, sexual arousal was induced by erotic video stimuli. Subjective sexual arousal was assessed continuously during stimulus presentation and genital arousal was measured with vaginal photoplethysmography. Data of 58 women (M age = 24.95, SD = 4.65) were analyzed using multilevel analyses (HLM). This data analytic technique estimates the within-subject associations of subjective and genital arousal, by controlling for between-subject differences. An interaction term of sexual excitation and sexual inhibition significantly predicted genital sexual arousal. In exploratory analyses, two lower order factors of sexual inhibition (Concerns about Sexual Function and Arousal Contingency) were predictive of sexual concordance. Further examination of these associations might increase our knowledge of female sexual function and deepen our understanding of how sexual excitation and sexual inhibition affect sexual arousal and consequently, impact sexual behaviors, in women.",1.0,1
"Abstract Although research examining the association between problematic smartphone use and mental health has grown recently, there is a lack of studies investigating possible associations with physical (somatic) symptoms. Moreover, many studies are based on student samples from North America and China, limiting their generalizability. The current study aimed to examine problematic smartphone use in a broad sample of German adults. An online survey comprising demographic questions, problematic smartphone use scales and somatic symptom inventories, as well as depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality scales was completed by 930 participants. Problematic smartphone users reported longer usage per day, more interruptions to activities to check their smartphones, and higher scores for stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and somatic symptoms than did unproblematic users. In comparison, both groups allocated similar proportions of time to various applications. The results showed small to moderate bivariate associations between problematic smartphone use and indicators of mental health and somatic symptoms, while a multivariate analysis highlighted the importance of perceived stress. Since mental health and somatic symptoms are associated with problematic smartphone use, future studies should investigate the causal direction of the associations found.",1.0,1
"OBJECTIVE: Spirit possession is a phenomenon frequently occurring in war-torn countries. It has been shown to be an idiom of distress entailing dissociative symptoms. However, its association with trauma exposure and trauma-related disorders remains unclear. This study aimed to explore subjective disease models and the relationship between pathological spirit possession and trauma-related disorders in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. METHOD: Seventy-three (formerly) possessed persons (74% female, mean age = 34 years), referred by traditional and spiritual healers, were interviewed about their experiences of pathological spirit possession, trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depressive symptoms, shame and guilt, psychotic symptoms, somatic complaints, and the impairment of psychosocial functioning. RESULTS: The most common disease model for pathological spirit possession was another person having sent the spirit, mostly a family member or a neighbor, out of jealousy or conflict over resources. Significant correlations were found between spirit possession over lifetime and PTSD symptom severity, feelings of shame and guilt, depressive symptoms, somatic complaints, and psychotic symptoms. Spirit possession during the preceding 4 weeks was associated with PTSD symptom severity, impairment of psychosocial functioning, and psychotic symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that pathological spirit possession is a broad explanatory framework for various subjectively unexplainable mental and physical health problems, including but not limited to trauma-related disorders. Understanding pathological spirit possession as a subjective disease model for various mental and physical health problems may help researchers and clinicians to develop culturally sensitive treatment approaches for affected individuals.

"Background and Objectives. Perfectionism is a multidimensional personality trait often viewed as a risk factor for developing test anxiety. A recent meta-analysis showed positive correlations of perfectionism facets with test anxiety dimensions. However, all previous research into the perfectionism-test anxiety relation has been cross-sectional. Thus, it is unclear whether perfectionism facets longitudinally predict test anxiety.Design. In this study, we investigated concurrent and predictive relations of two perfectionism facets with cognitive test anxiety (worry) and affective test anxiety (emotionality) in secondary school students (N = 478, mean age at T1 = 11.95 years). At T1, participants completed self-report measures of text anxiety and perfectionism. Almost five years later, participants again reported their test anxiety levels (T2).Results. Concern over mistakes and doubts correlated positively with current worry and emotionality. Personal standards correlated positively with current worry. Neither concern over mistakes and doubts nor personal standards significantly predicted later test anxiety beyond baseline.Conclusions. Perfectionism and test anxiety share common manifestations. Yet, this study raises the question whether perfectionism truly influences test anxiety development or whether other factors (e.g., construct overlap) may explain the identified cross-sectional correlations. Future research is needed to provide more nuanced insights into perfectionism-test anxiety associations.",0.0,0
"Interoceptive threats play a crucial role in the etiology of panic disorder (PD). While body sensations may become conditioned stimuli (CS) when paired with such interoceptive threats (cue conditioning), the environment in which such interoceptive threats occur may also be learned as a predictor of threat (context conditioning). Suffocation fear (SF) might facilitate these associative learning processes if threats of suffocation become relevant as unconditioned stimuli (US). To investigate whether SF affects associative learning during such respiratory threat, we used mild dyspnea as CS that predicted the occurrence of strong dyspnea (US) in one context (predictable), was not related to the occurrence of the US in another context (unpredictable) or was presented in a different context (safe) in which no US was delivered. Startle eyeblink responses and subjective reports were assessed in 34 participants during learning. Individuals reporting high SF showed a clear potentiation of the startle response during the interoceptive CS predicting the occurrence of interoceptive threat (US). Such startle potentiation was not observed when the CS remained unpaired (safe or unpredictable context). Moreover, high SF persons also showed a significant startle potentiation to the threatening context, when the CS did not predict the onset of the US. No such learning effects were observed for low SF individuals. The data support the view that defensive response mobilization can be triggered by cues but also by contexts that predict the occurrence of interoceptive threats if these threats are relevant for the individuals, supporting learning accounts for the development of PD.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Positive expectations play an important role in effective treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD). The way a study is contextualized modulates prognostic expectations. AIMS: The aim of the study was to test the effect of differing information regarding the rationale given to participants for a study on depression symptoms. METHOD: Sixty-nine participants with depression symptoms participated in an online study with two conditions. In random order, half were invited to participate in a treatment study and half in a cognition study. After completing the baseline assessment, participants received one of two self-help manuals. Post-assessment was conducted six weeks later. RESULTS: Only about 64% of the participants were reached for post-assessment, and adherence was low. However, our results offer the first evidence that stronger improvements emerged in participants who were told the trial was a treatment study compared with a cognition study. CONCLUSION: Information given about the rationale for a study could influence symptom reduction in online treatments for patients with MDD. Future (online) studies should attempt to replicate these results.",1.0,0
"Both obsessive-compulsive disorder and subclinical obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms seem to be associated with hyperactive error-related brain activity. The current study examined performance monitoring in subjects with subclinical OC symptoms using a new task with different levels of difficulty. Nineteen subjects with high and 18 subjects with low OC characteristics performed a random dot cinematogram (RDC) task with three levels of difficulty. The high and low OC groups did not differ in error-related negativity (ERN), correct-related negativity (CRN) and performance irrespective of task difficulty. The amplitude of the ERN decreased with increasing difficulty whereas the magnitude of CRN did not vary. ERN and CRN approached in size and topography with increasing difficulty, which suggests that errors and correct responses are processed more similarly. These results add to a growing number of studies that fail to replicate hyperactive performance monitoring in individuals with OC symptoms in task with higher difficulty or requiring learning. Together with these findings our results suggest that the relationship between OC symptoms and performance monitoring may be sensitive to type of task and task characteristics and cannot be observed in a RDC that differs from typically used tasks in difficulty and the amount of response-conflict.",0.0,0
"The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project's success rests on the assumption that constructs and data can be integrated across units of analysis and developmental stages. We adopted a psychoneurometric approach to establish biobehavioral liability models of sensitivity to social threat, a key component of potential threat that is particularly salient to the development of adolescent affective psychopathology. Models were derived from measures across four units of analysis in a community sample (n = 129) of 11- to 13-year-old girls oversampled for shy/fearful temperament. To test the ecological validity of derived factors, they were then related to real-world socioaffective processes in peer interactions over a 16-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol. Our results indicate that measures (i.e., amygdala reactivity to negative social feedback, eye-tracking bias toward social threat, parent- and adolescent-reports of social threat sensitivity) formed unit-specific factors, rather than one unified factor. These findings suggest that these factors were largely unrelated. Amygdala response to social punishment and attention bias toward threatening faces predicted real-world experiences with peers, suggesting that vigilance toward potentially threatening social information could be a mechanism through which vulnerable youth come to experience their peer interactions more negatively. We discuss measurement challenges confronting efforts to quantify developmentally sensitive RDoC constructs across units of analysis.

"Four studies investigated the construct validity of the brief version of the German Narcissistic Personality Inventory-13 (G-NPI-13). Study 1 ( N = 603) confirmed the three-factor structure of the G-NPI-13 and its associations with the NPI-40 and the NPI-16. In Study 2 ( N = 438), the convergent and discriminant validity of the G-NPI-13 was analyzed by investigating its relationships with the ""Big Five,"" self-esteem, and mental health variables (depression, anxiety, stress symptoms; life satisfaction, happiness, social support). Study 3 ( N = 118) provided further support for the convergence between the G-NPI-13 and the NPI-40 by investigating their associations with vulnerable narcissism, self-monitoring, and mental health. In Study 4 ( N = 82), the 1-year test-retest reliability (three measurement time points) of the G-NPI-13 was investigated. Taken together, the G-NPI-13 is a valid, reliable, and economical instrument for measuring the personality trait narcissism. Possible practical applications and limitations of the G-NPI-13 are discussed.",1.0,1
"Abstract How do individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) process and respond to images of rotten food or dirty toilets? In contrast to other fear-related disorders, evidence for attentional biases and preferential processing of disorder-related stimuli in samples of OCD is mixed. To address methodological problems of previous studies and to increase validity, we used two independent samples of participants with contamination fear and two sets of standardized stimuli in an established experimental paradigm. In two experiments, we compared evaluation and visual processing of contamination-fear related (CFr) stimulus material in individuals with high (HCF) and low (LCF) contamination fear. In experiment 1, we selected CFr stimuli from a database with disgust-related images (DIRTI). Even though the HCF group rated CFr images as being more unpleasant, arousing, and disgusting, we found no indicators of preferential processing (larger priming effects or faster responses). In experiment 2, we selected CFr stimuli from a database with images specifically chosen to evoke symptom-related anxiety in OCD patients (BOCD-PS). Again, negative evaluations of stimuli did not transfer into enhanced information processing. We conclude that early information processing of CFr stimuli is fundamentally different to that of fear-related stimuli in anxiety disorders; probably because of the triggered disgust response.",0.0,0
"RATIONALE: Mental health problems in children and adolescents are widespread and are a primary public health concern worldwide. During childhood and adolescence different challenges must be met. Whether the corresponding developmental tasks can be mastered successfully and in a psychologically healthy manner depends on the availability of resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to examine the benefits of maternal education on the development of mental health in children and adolescents. METHOD: Data from 2810 participants (48.7% female, 7- to 19-years old) of the longitudinal BELLA study (mental health module of the representative German KiGGS study) were analyzed from up to four measurement points (2003-2012). Individual growth modeling was employed to estimate the benefits of maternal education (Comparative Analysis of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations, CASMIN) for the trajectories of mental health problems (parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ) in children and adolescents. RESULTS: Children of mothers with low education had significantly more mental health problems compared to children of mothers with high education. This difference due to maternal education applied for girls as well as boys and especially for participants who did not live with both biological parents. Further, the difference in mental health problems due to varying maternal education decreased with increasing age of the participants. CONCLUSION: Prevention programs should focus on children of mothers with lower education who additionally live in single- or step-parent families as a high-risk group. Knowledge of the underlying mechanism between education and mental health is highly important.",1.0,1
"OBJECTIVE: Obesity prevalence among children is high and knowledge on cognitive factors that contribute to children's reactivity to the ""obesogenic"" food environment could help to design effective treatment and prevention campaigns. Empirical studies in adults suggest that attention bias for food could be a risk factor for overeating. Accordingly, the current study tested if children with obesity have an elevated attention bias for food when compared to healthy-weight children. Another aim was to explore whether attention biases for food predicted weight-change after 3 and 6 months in obese children. METHOD: Obese children (n = 34) were recruited from an intervention program and tested prior to the start of this intervention. Healthy-weight children (n = 36) were recruited from local schools. First, attention biases for food were compared between children with obesity (n = 30) and matched healthy-weight children (n = 30). Second, regression analyses were conducted to test if food-related attention biases predicted weight changes after 3 and 6 months in children with obesity following a weight loss lifestyle intervention. RESULTS: Results showed that obese children did not differ from healthy-weight children in their attention bias to food. Yet automatically directing attention toward food (i.e., initial orientation bias) was related to a reduced weight loss (R(2) = .14, p = .032) after 6 months in children with obesity. DISCUSSION: High palatable food is a salient stimulus for all children, irrespective of their weight status. However, automatically directing attention to food cues might facilitate further weight gain in children with obesity.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Internet interventions have been shown to be effective in treating anxiety disorders. Most interventions to date focus on single disorders and disregard potential comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this mixed-methods study was to investigate feasibility, user experience, and effects of a newly developed individually tailored transdiagnostic guided internet intervention for anxiety disorders. METHODS: This study is an uncontrolled, within-group, baseline, postintervention pilot trial with an embedded qualitative and quantitative process and effect evaluation. In total, 49 adults with anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder n=20, social phobia n=19, agoraphobia without panic n=12, panic with agoraphobia n=6, panic without agoraphobia n=4, subclinical depression n=41) received access to the 7-session intervention. We examined motivation and expectations, intervention use, user experience, impact, and modification requests. Qualitative data were assessed using semistructured interviews and analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Quantitative outcomes included symptom severity of anxiety and depression (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A], Quick Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology clinician rating [QIDS-C]), diagnostic status in clinical interviews (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]), and web-based self-reports (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7], Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D], Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI], Panic and Agoraphobia Scale [PAS], Social Phobia Scale [SPS], Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at baseline and postassessment. Quantitative data was analyzed by comparing within-group means expressed as Cohen d. RESULTS: Anxiety symptom severity (HAM-A d=1.19) and depressive symptoms (QIDS-C d=0.42) improved significantly, and 54% (21/39) no longer were diagnosed as having any anxiety disorder. The main positive effects were the general improvement of disease burden and attentiveness to feelings and risk situations while the main negative effects experienced were lack of change in disease burden and symptom deterioration. The most prevalent reasons for participation were the advantages of online treatment, symptom burden, and openness toward online treatment. Helpful factors included support, psychoeducation and practicing strategies in daily life; the main hindering factors were too little individualization and being overwhelmed by the content and pace. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was found to be feasible and results show preliminary data indicating potential efficacy for improving anxiety and depression. The next step should be the evaluation within a randomized controlled trial. Concerning intervention development, it was found that future interventions should emphasize individualization even more in order to further improve the fit to individual characteristics, preferences, and needs.",1.0,1
"Abstract Adaptive behavior depends on the process of self-regulation. If self-regulation fails, maladaptive behavior may start to predominate, leading to impulsive actions, maladaptive habits, and compulsive behavior patterns. The tendency to develop habitual behavior differs between individuals and appears to be associated with different aspects of regulatory control. The present study examined associations of habitual propensity with self-regulation, impulsivity, and compulsivity, elucidating possible underlying functional connections and evaluated the psychometric properties of a German version of the Creature of Habit Scale (COHS). Data of two independent community samples was collected online. Dynamic connections with measures of regulatory control, namely self-regulation, impulsivity, and compulsivity, were analyzed using a network approach. Psychometric analyses were conducted using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses utilizing a Bayesian lasso procedure. Network analysis revealed that self-regulation was the most central node within the network of dynamic interactions between habitual propensity, impulsivity, and compulsivity. Self-regulation exclusively had negative associations with other measures. We replicated and validated the two-factorial structure of the COHS. Our findings provide evidence that habitual propensity is interconnected with measures of regulatory control. Information gathered using the COHS could be useful in identifying vulnerabilities and developing tailored therapeutic strategies for psychopathologies associated with deficient regulatory control.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional expectations are considered to be core features of mental disorders and, in particular, major depression. The aim of the present study was to integrate two important types of expectations into the cognitive model of depression: situation-specific dysfunctional expectations (SDE) and dispositional optimism (DO). It was hypothesized that the influence of both DO and intermediate beliefs (IB) on depressive symptoms would be mediated via SDE. METHODS: We examined 95 individuals (age M = 40.7, 68.1% female) with a diagnosed major depressive disorder from two inpatient clinics and one outpatient clinic. Measurements used in the study included the Depressive Expectations Scale, Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale, Life Orientation Test Revised, and Beck's Depression Inventory-II. Relationships between the constructs were analyzed using path-analytic models with bias-corrected bootstrapping confidence intervals. RESULTS: Results indicate that the effect of IB on depressive symptoms was fully mediated via SDE, while the effect of DO on depressive symptoms was partly mediated via SDE. IB and DO moderately correlated with each other. LIMITATIONS: Due to the cross-sectional design of the study, it is not possible to draw unambiguous conclusions regarding the causality of the suggested relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The present study stresses the crucial role of dysfunctional expectations for major depression. Moreover, it reveals that SDEs as expectations with a high level of situational specificity may pose an important link between global cognitions and depressive symptoms. Given this situational specificity, SDEs are amenable to disconfirmation through behavioral experiments and may therefore be a promising target for cognitive-behavioral interventions.",1.0,1
"• Daily stress positively predicts addictive social media use (SMU) three months later during Covid-19 lockdown. • Online social support mediates the link between daily stress and addictive SMU. • Physical activity moderates the link between online social support and addictive SMU. • Physical activity before Covid-19 outbreak can contribute to less addictive SMU during the pandemic. People who experience high levels of daily stress often resort to intensive social media use (SMU). In the short-term, this can contribute to relief and positive emotions. However, in the longer-term, intensive online activity can foster addictive tendencies. The present longitudinal study investigated the association between daily stress and addictive SMU. Data were assessed in a sample of 211 social media users ( M age ( SD age ) = 22.50 (5.00)) from Germany via online surveys at two measurement time points in winter 2020 (baseline, BL), and three months later in spring 2020 during the first Covid-19 lockdown (follow-up, FU). In moderated mediation analyses, the positive relationship between daily stress (BL) and addictive SMU (BL) and (FU) was significantly mediated by the level of perceived online social support (BL). Physical activity (BL) (e.g., jogging and cycling) significantly moderated the relationship between online social support (BL) and addictive SMU (BL) and (FU). Specifically, the association between both variables was significant for medium and low frequency of physical activity, but not for high frequency. The mostly female and relatively young sample composition limits the generalizability of the present findings. No experimental manipulation of the potential predictors of addictive SMU was introduced limiting the causal interpretation of the current results. The current findings disclose mechanisms that could reduce the risk of addictive SMU. Specifically, a conscious increase of physical activity could prevent the transformation of positive emotions evoked by the perception of online social support into addictive tendencies.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is commonly proposed to be characterized by an enhanced sensitivity for emotional stimuli. In the present study, we investigated whether BPD patients show a superior detection of emotional facial expressions relative to healthy controls. The detection of emotional information in the environment represents an important facet of emotional sensitivity. SAMPLING AND METHODS: Twenty patients with BPD were compared with 25 healthy controls. The participants were presented a rapid, continuous stream of neutral and randomly inserted emotional facial expressions and were asked to report the presentation of an emotional facial stimulus after each trial. Availability of cognitive resources was manipulated via two different task demands. RESULTS: The participants with BPD performed significantly better in the detection of positive and negative facial expressions compared to the healthy controls. False alarm rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The BPD participants showed an enhanced detection of emotional expressions that might be related to the emotional disturbances they experience. In particular, we will discuss the role of this superior emotion detection (in combination with previously reported deficits in the labeling of emotional states) for the understanding of emotional instability in BPD.",0.0,0
"Judgment of well-being is formed on the spot, and we know little about its foundations. We aimed at examining the role of comparison standards in informing evaluations of well-being in a clinical and a nonclinical sample. In a semi-structured face-to-face interview, individuals seeking psychological treatment and healthy control individuals rated how they have been feeling in general and relative to specific comparison standards and were each time invited to substantiate their ratings. Independent coders assessed number, type, direction, and specificity of reported comparisons. When asked to explain why they chose a particular rating of their well-being, 93% of clinical participants and 61% of nonclinical participants spontaneously reported some type of comparison standard. Both groups reported highest well-being ratings relative to social and past temporal comparisons and lowest relative to prospective temporal comparison. Furthermore, clinical participants engaged in more upward than downward comparisons, whereas this was not the case for healthy control participants. Our findings suggest that evaluations of well-being are informed by different comparison types and that individuals with clinical complaints use more comparisons when evaluating their well-being. The results encourage further investigation of comparative thinking as an underlying mechanism of judgment of well-being and ill-being.",1.0,0
"Retrospective and experimental data demonstrate the importance of emotion regulation (ER) in the maintenance of binge episodes in binge eating disorder (BED). The current study tested whether mood and ER prospectively influence binge episodes in individuals with BED via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Individuals with BED (n = 79) completed two weeks of EMA. Each sampling point consisted of a series of questions pertaining to participants' mood, ER, and eating behaviour. Successful application of adaptive ER strategies predicted subsequent abstinence, while rumination predicted subsequent binge episodes. However, neither successful application of adaptive ER, nor maladaptive ER, moderated the association between negative mood and probability of binge episodes. This naturalistic study emphasizes the importance of promoting the successful application of adaptive ER skills and cessation of rumination in treatment interventions designed to decrease the occurrence of binge episodes in BED.",0.0,0
"PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze the association between the importance of several reasons to follow a vegan diet and the degree of orthorexic eating behavior in a sample of vegan individuals (N = 65, 53.8% women, age: M = 28.22 (SD = 9.13) years, BMI: M = 22.91 (SD = 3.44) kg/m(2)). RESULTS: The results reveal that orthorexic eating behavior is associated with the importance of the underlying motives health, esthetics and healing, whereas animal welfare, politics and ecology are not linked to orthorexia. CONCLUSION: Hence, this study reveals that a vegan lifestyle is not per se associated with orthorexic eating behavior, but rather that it varies with the underlying motivation for following a vegan diet.",0.0,0
"Academia has been facing a mental health crisis particularly affecting early career researchers (ECRs). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic posed an unprecedented burden on the mental health of many individuals. Therefore, we cross-sectionally investigated how doctoral researchers (N = 222) evaluate their mental health status and satisfaction with their PhD training before and during the pandemic. As compared to self-reported, retrospective evaluations about the pre-pandemic state, we found decreased satisfaction with PhD training and overall well-being. The whole sample exhibited high levels of personal and work-related burnout, a fifth indicated clinically meaningful levels of depressive symptoms and almost 25% experienced severe loneliness. When exploring predictors of depression, anxiety, and burnout, we identified low satisfaction with PhD training as the most prominent predictor for poor mental health, suggesting a link between the doctoral work and their mental health status. Females vs. males and doctoral researchers in individual doctorate vs. structured PhD programs reported higher symptoms of burnout. Our study replicates previous findings of poor mental health in doctoral researchers and indicates further decreases of mental wellbeing under the influence of the pandemic. Systematic adjustments in academia are required to improve the mental health of ECRs.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: The long-term course of symptoms in patients with mild-to-moderate depression is not well understood. A 12-month-follow-up analysis was performed on those participants from a randomized controlled 10-week trial (RCT, MIND-study), who had received either treatment with an antidepressant (sertraline) or a psychotherapeutic intervention (group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)). METHODS: The longitudinal interval follow-up evaluation (LIFE) was applied to 77 patients with mild-to moderate depression. The primary outcome was the number of weeks in the one-year follow-up period spent completely recovered from all depressive symptoms. Functional outcome was measured with the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. Further outcomes were relapse and remission rates based on weekly psychiatric rating scales (PSR) and the number of weeks in the follow-up period during which patients had a depressive disorder or subthreshold symptoms of depression. RESULTS: Patients with acute treatment (10 weeks) with SSRI and those with acute treatment with CBT (also 10 weeks) did not differ significantly concerning the number of weeks in the follow-up period in which they were completely recovered (primary outcome) (SSRI: 31.6 weeks (standard deviation (SD): 23.7), CBT: 27.8 weeks (SD: 24.3)). Sertraline was superior to CBT regarding GAF scores by trend (p = 0.06). LIMITATIONS: The generalizability of the findings is limited by the moderate sample size and missing values (LIFE). CONCLUSIONS: Sertraline and group CBT have similar anti-depressive effects in the long-term course of mild-to-moderate depression. Regarding long-term global functioning, sertraline seems to be slightly superior to CBT.",0.0,0
"Aiming to further our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of auditory working memory (WM), the present study compared performance for three auditory materials (words, tones, timbres). In a forward recognition task (Experiment 1) participants indicated whether the order of the items in the second sequence was the same as in the first sequence. In a backward recognition task (Experiment 2) participants indicated whether the items of the second sequence were played in the correct backward order. In Experiment 3 participants performed an articulatory suppression task during the retention delay of the backward task. To investigate potential length effects the number of items per sequence was manipulated. Overall findings underline the benefit of a cross-material experimental approach and suggest that human auditory WM is not a unitary system. Whereas WM processes for timbres differed from those for tones and words, similarities and differences were observed for words and tones: Both types of stimuli appear to rely on rehearsal mechanisms, but might differ in the involved sensorimotor codes.",1.0,0
"PREVIOUS RESEARCH REVEALED AN AUTOMATIC BEHAVIORAL BIAS IN HIGH SOCIALLY ANXIOUS INDIVIDUALS (HSAS): although their explicit evaluations of smiling faces are positive, they show automatic avoidance of these faces. This is reflected by faster pushing than pulling of smiling faces in an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT; Heuer et al., 2007). The current study addressed the causal role of this avoidance bias for social anxiety. To this end, we used the AAT to train HSAs, either to approach smiling faces or to avoid them. We examined whether such an AAT training could change HSAs' automatic avoidance tendencies, and if yes, whether AAT effects would generalize to a new approach task with new facial stimuli, and to mood and anxiety in a social threat situation (a video-recorded self-presentation). We found that HSAs trained to approach smiling faces did indeed approach female faces faster after the training than HSAs trained to avoid smiling faces. Moreover, approach-faces training reduced emotional vulnerability: it led to more positive mood and lower anxiety after the self-presentation than avoid-faces training. These results suggest that automatic approach-avoidance tendencies have a causal role in social anxiety, and that they can be modified by a simple computerized training. This may open new avenues in the therapy of social phobia.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The look into the mirror represents a typical trigger situation for people with body dysmorphic concerns. Mirror exposure on the other hand is commonly used in the treatment of Body Dysmorphic Disorder even though little is known about its precise effects. This study aimed to investigate cognitive-affective processes related to mirror gazing. METHODS: A total of 125 individuals (screening for body dysmorphic concerns: N(BDD+) = 56, negative N(BDD-) = 69) participated in a laboratory study using a guided 10-min mirror gazing task. Participants were randomized to one of two experimental conditions, a non-judgmental and judgmental description of the own body during mirror gazing. Distress, self-hostile cognitions and post-event processing were assessed after the task and at follow-up. RESULTS: Participants with body dysmorphic concerns showed higher values regarding subjective appearance distortion, stress induced by the exposure, distress, self-hostile cognitions and post-event processing compared to the symptom negative group. The two conditions did not yield differential effects. LIMITATIONS: The short duration of the mirror gazing and the only internal description of the body may have contributed to a missing effect for the approach. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the importance of cognitive and affective processes in reaction to mirror exposure. They support the cognitive model of BDD and suggest post-event processing as a relevant factor requiring further investigation in future research.",0.0,0
"OBJECTIVE: Meta-analytic evidence showed robust associations between the alliance in psychotherapeutic dyads and treatment outcomes. Recent studies have indicated that facets of positive mental health are additionally relevant predictors of both the alliance and success of psychotherapy. However, the impact of patients' pre-therapy strengths on the alliance at the beginning and during treatment has been scarcely examined. METHOD: 428 patients (62.4% female, M(age) = 40.79), treated by 41 therapists, underwent cognitive behavioral therapy in a German outpatient training and research center. Alliance from patients' perspectives was assessed at the beginning and during treatment. Data were analyzed with multilevel growth curve modeling. RESULTS: Alliance increased during psychotherapy, with a quadratic trajectory best representing this trend on average, p < .001. Pre-therapy strengths were positively related to alliance intercept, b = 0.0537, p < .001. No interaction was found between the included time variables and pre-therapy strengths in the prediction of the alliance slope. CONCLUSION: Positive mental health facets should be considered in psychotherapy research and practice. Future studies may focus on the parallel development of patients' strengths with other process factors in treatment.",0.0,0
"BACKGROUND: The present study aimed at investigating whether resting vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) as a trait-like biomarker of cognitive inhibitory control capacity is related to suicide ideation in a sample without suicide attempt history. METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy students participated voluntarily (18 to 34 years, M=24.5, SD=4.1; 73.0% female). Time and frequency measures of HRV were derived from an electrocardiogram that was recorded using Einthoven's Triangle lead II. Participants filled in the Rasch-based Depression Screening and four questions concerning lifetime suicide ideation (SI). Bivariate Pearson's and partial (controlling for depression severity) correlation coefficients were calculated between SI and measures of vagally mediated HRV. RESULTS: A significant correlation between the ln10-transformed high-frequency band of resting vagally mediated HRV and SI was found (r=-.33, p<.05). Correlations did not change substantially when controlling for depression. Mean heart rate as a time domain measure also significantly correlated with SI while controlling for depression (r=.36, p<.05). A trend correlation between SI and Root Mean Square of Successive Differences between interbeat intervals emerged. LIMITATIONS: SI was assessed with a composite score of four items measuring SI. Future studies should consider using more comprehensive assessment instruments. CONCLUSIONS: The relation between resting vagally mediated HRV and suicide ideation may be interpreted as indicating that reduced inhibitory cognitive control capacity may be a risk factor for suicidality. It may act already early in the suicidal process, before suicidal behavior develops and should be further investigated as potentially clinically important physiological predictor of suicidality.",1.0,0
"OBJECTIVE: Results from clinical trials indicate that Internet-based psychological pain interventions are effective in treating chronic pain. However, little is known about patients' acceptance of these programs and how to positively influence patients' intention to engage in them. Therefore, the present study aimed (1) to assess patients' acceptance of Internet-based interventions, and (2) to examine whether patients' acceptance can be increased by an acceptance facilitating intervention. METHODS: A total of 104 patients with chronic pain from 2 pain units were randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG) and a no-intervention control group (CG). The IG was shown a short informational video about Internet-based psychological pain interventions before receiving a questionnaire on patients' acceptance of Internet-based psychological pain interventions and predictors of acceptance (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, Internet usage, and Internet anxiety). The CG filled out the questionnaire immediately. Patients' acceptance was measured with a 4-item scale (sum score ranging from 4 to 20). RESULTS: Baseline acceptance of Internet-based interventions was reported as low (sum-score:4-9) by 53.8%, moderate (10 to 15) by 42.3%, and high (16 to 20) by 3.9% of the patients with chronic pain in the CG. The IG showed a significantly higher acceptance (M = 12.17, SD = 4.22) than the CG (M = 8.94, SD = 3.71) with a standardized mean difference of d = 0.81 (95% CI, 0.41, 1.21). All predictor variables were significantly improved in the IG compared with the CG, except for Internet usage. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic pain display a relatively low acceptance of Internet-based psychological pain interventions, which can be substantially increased by a short informational video.",1.0,1
"The purpose of the study was to contrast first panic attacks (PAs) of patients with panic disorder (PD) with vs. without agoraphobia and to explore differences between first PAs leading to the development of PD and those that remain isolated. Data were drawn from a community survey (N=2259 including 88 isolated PAs and 75 PD cases). An additional sample of 234 PD patients was recruited in a clinical setting. A standardized interview assessed the symptoms of the first PA, context of its occurrence and subsequent coping attempts. Persons who developed PD reported more severe first PAs, more medical service utilization and exposure-limiting coping attempts than those with isolated PAs. The context of the first PA did not differ between PD and isolated PAs. PD with agoraphobia was specifically associated with greater symptom severity and occurrence of first attacks in public. Future research should validate these findings using a longitudinal approach.",0.0,0
"Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common psychiatric condition after stroke, affecting one third of survivors. Despite identification of meaningful predictors, knowledge about the interplay between these factors remains fragmentary. General self-efficacy (GSE) is closely linked to PSD, yet direction and magnitude of this relationship remains unclear. The authors assessed the relationship between GSE and depression during the first two years post-stroke while controlling for stable inter-individual differences using continuous time (CT) structural equation modelling (SEM). Patients of two German rehabilitation centres (N = 294, mean age = 63.78 years, SD = 10.83) were assessed six weeks after ischemic stroke and at four follow-ups covering two years. GSE Scale and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were used to assess GSE and depression. CT-analysis revealed significantly higher within-person cross-effects of GSE on GDS (a(21) = -.29) than vice versa (a(12 )= -.17). Maximal cross-lagged effects emerged six months post-stroke. Our results show that decreasing GSE led to increasing depressiveness, and only to a smaller extent vice versa. This suggests that fostering GSE by strengthening perceived control after stroke can counter PSD emersion and exacerbation. Six months post-stroke, when patients face social re-integration, programmes focusing on GSE could potentially help to prevent later PSD.",1.0,1
"Uncontrollable, compared with controllable, painful stimulation can lead to increased pain perception and activation in pain-processing brain regions, but it is currently unknown which brain areas mediate this effect. When pain is controllable, the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) seems to inhibit pain processing, although it is unclear how this is achieved. Using fMRI in healthy volunteers, we examined brain activation during controllable and uncontrollable stimulation to answer these questions. In the controllable task, participants self-adjusted temperatures applied to their hand of pain or warm intensities to provoke a constant sensation. In the uncontrollable task, the temperature time courses of the controllable task were replayed (yoked control) and participants rated their sensation continuously. During controllable pain trials, participants significantly downregulated the temperature to keep their sensation constant. Despite receiving the identical nociceptive input, intensity ratings increased during the uncontrollable pain trials. This additional sensitization was mirrored in increased activation of pain-processing regions such as insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. Further, increased connectivity between the anterior insula and medial PFC (mPFC) in the uncontrollable and increased negative connectivity between dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) and insula in the controllable task were observed. This suggests a pain-facilitating role of the mPFC during uncontrollable pain and a pain-inhibiting role of the dlPFC during controllable pain, both exerting their respective effects via the anterior insula. These results elucidate neural mechanisms of context-dependent pain modulation and their relation to subjective perception. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Pain control is of uttermost importance and stimulus controllability is an important way to achieve endogenous pain modulation. Here, we show differential effects of controllability and uncontrollability on pain perception and cerebral pain processing. When pain was controllable, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex downregulated pain-evoked activation in important pain-processing regions. In contrast, sensitization during uncontrollable pain was mediated by increased connectivity of the medial prefrontal cortex with the anterior insula and other pain-processing regions. These novel insights into cerebral pain modulation by stimulus controllability have the potential to improve treatment approaches in pain patients.",1.0,1
"BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders and vitamin D deficiency are highly prevalent health problems. Few studies examined the effect of vitamin D concentrations on objectively measured sleep with high methodological quality and temporal proximity. Previous analysis within the LIFE-Adult-Study suggested that a lower concentration of serum vitamin D was associated with both shorter and later night sleep. However, no conclusion about underlying mechanisms could be drawn. We addressed the question whether this relationship is explained by the presence of depressive syndromes, which are linked to both vitamin D deficiency and sleep disturbances. METHODS: It was investigated whether the association of vitamin D concentrations and night sleep parameters is mediated or moderated by depressive symptomatology. We investigated a subset (n = 1252) of the community sample from the LIFE-Adult-Study, in which sleep parameters had been objectively assessed using actigraphy, based on which two sleep parameters were calculated: night sleep duration and midsleep time. Serum 25(OH) D concentrations were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Depressive symptomatology was evaluated with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The mediation effect was analyzed by using Hayes' PROCESS macro tool for SPSS for Windows. RESULTS: The depressive symptomatology was neither significantly associated with night sleep duration nor midsleep time. The associations between vitamin D concentrations and night sleep duration/midsleep time through mediation by depressive symptomatology were not significant. Corresponding moderator analyses were also non-significant. CONCLUSION: The associations between vitamin D concentrations and night sleep parameters (sleep duration and midsleep time) seem to be neither mediated nor moderated by depressive symptomatology.",0.0,0
"Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by impairments in extinction learning and social behaviour, which are targeted by trauma-focused cognitive behavioural treatment (TF-CBT). The biological underpinnings of TF-CBT can be better understood by adding biomarkers to the clinical evaluation of interventions. Due to their involvement in social functioning and fear processing, oxytocin and arginine vasopressin might be informative biomarkers for TF-CBT, but to date, this has never been tested. Objective: To differentiate the impact of traumatic event exposure and PTSD symptoms on blood oxytocin and vasopressin concentrations. Further, to describe courses of PTSD symptoms, oxytocin and vasopressin during an internet-based TF-CBT and explore interactions between these parameters. Method: We compared oxytocin and vasopressin between three groups of active and former male service members of the German Armed Forces (n = 100): PTSD patients (n = 39), deployed healthy controls who experienced a deployment-related traumatic event (n = 33) and non-deployed healthy controls who never experienced a traumatic event (n = 28). PTSD patients underwent a 5-week internet-based TF-CBT. We correlated PTSD symptoms with oxytocin and vasopressin before treatment onset. Further, we analysed courses of PTSD symptoms, oxytocin and vasopressin from pre- to post-treatment and 3 months follow-up, as well as interactions between the three parameters. Results: Oxytocin and vasopressin did not differ between the groups and were unrelated to PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms were highly stable over time, whereas the endocrine parameters were not, and they also did not change in mean. Oxytocin and vasopressin were not associated with PTSD symptoms longitudinally. Conclusions: Mainly due to their insufficient intraindividual stability, single measurements of endogenous oxytocin and vasopressin concentrations are not informative biomarkers for TF-CBT. We discuss how the stability of these biomarkers might be increased and how they could be better related to the specific impairments targeted by TF-CBT.",0.0,0
"Interoception is impaired in different psychiatric disorders and is also associated with emotions. Only one study could show a higher interoceptive accuracy (IAcc) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Based on the predictive coding system we assume contrary results, indicating a decreased IAcc in patients with OCD. So far, there is no study investigating the effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy on IAcc in patients with OCD. Therefore, we hypothesize that patients with OCD improve their IAcc during the time course of therapy compared to healthy controls. Twenty-six patients with OCD from the Psychosomatic Clinic in Windach were examined in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. They were compared to 26 matched healthy controls. IAcc via the heartbeat perception task as well as questionnaire data (OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms) were assessed. Results showed that IAcc, OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms were attenuated in patients with OCD. Patients recovered in the time course of therapy regarding OCD-, depression- and anxiety symptoms. Interoceptive deficits did not change in the time course of cognitive-behavioral therapy. We demonstrated that IAcc is affected in patients with OCD and this deficit does not change during the time course of a standardized therapy. Future studies should investigate, whether an inaccuracy in perceiving one's bodily signals constitutes a risk factor for relapse. Further, it could be examined if IAcc can be increased via self- and body focus interventions in patients with OCD.",1.0,0
