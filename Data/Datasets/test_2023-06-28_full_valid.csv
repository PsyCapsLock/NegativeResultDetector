automatic orienting to unexpected change in the environment is a pre requisite for adaptive behavior one prominent mechanism of automatic attentional control is the orienting response or despite the fundamental significance of the or in everyday life only little is known about how the or is affected by healthy aging we tested this question in two age group 19 38 and 55 72 year and measured skin conductance response scrs and event related brain potential erps to novel i e short environmental sound presented only once in the experiment 10 of the trial compared to standard sound 600 hz sinusoidal tone with 200 m duration 90 of the trial novel and standard stimulus were presented in four condition differing in the inter stimulus interval isi with a mean isi of either 10 3 1 or 0 5 s blocked presentation in both age group pronounced scrs were elicited by novel in the 10 s isi condition suggesting the elicitation of stable or these effect were accompanied by pronounced n1 and frontal p3 amplitude in the erp suggesting that automatic novelty processing and orientation of attention are effective in both age group furthermore the scr and erp effect declined with decreasing isi length in addition difference between the two group were observable with the fastest presentation rate i e 1 and 0 5 s isi length the most prominent difference wa a shift of the peak of the frontal positivity from around 300 to 200 m in the 19 38 year group while in the 55 72 year group the amplitude of the frontal p3 decreased linearly with decreasing isi length taken together this pattern of result doe not suggest a general decline in processing efficacy with healthy aging at least with very rare change here the novel in the 10 s isi condition the or is a effective in healthy older adult a in younger adult with faster presentation rate however the efficacy of the or decrease this seems to result in a switch from novelty to deviant processing in younger adult but le so in the group of older adult,0.0
we investigated the dynamic of identity fusion and prosocial behavior within political group in the four week preceding and following the 2016 u s presidential election the primary question were whether a negative event losing would lead to a more pronounced increase in identity fusion and whether identity fusion would predict prosocial giving we found that while fusion gradually increased in the run up to the election there wa no significant increase after the event for supporter of either party we also found that identity fusion robustly predicted prosocial ingroup giving especially before the election and even when accounting for self reported identification and previous political commitment behavior implication for theory of identity fusion are discussed,0.0
the overestimation of the relationship between fear relevant stimulus and aversive consequence a so called covariation bias might contribute to the maintenance of anxiety disorder in a recent fmri study we confronted spider phobia and healthy participant with picture of spider mushroom and puppy randomly followed by painful electric stimulus u spider phobics overestimated the spider u association and displayed enhanced activity in u related sensorimotor cortex paracentral lobule pcl here we report result from an additional functional connectivity analysis within spider phobics but not in healthy control us after spider led to enhanced connectivity between pcl and left prefrontal cortex pfc most importantly covariation bias in spider phobia wa predicted by connectivity between pcl and visual cortex insula primary sensorimotor cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex reduced covariation bias wa predicted by connectivity between pcl and pfc in response to spider picture the amygdala wa functionally connected to somatosensory and visual area these result suggest that synchronous activity of sensory cortex may promote fear sustaining associative memory bias while right pfc might help to reduce bias,0.0
theoretically disgust sensitivity and disgust proneness could play an important role in hypochondriasis since disgust is a defensive emotion widely believed to protect the organism from illness however empirical evidence to support this hypothesis ha so far been based only on nonclinical sample so that the importance and specificity of disgust for hypochondriasis remains unclear in the current study 36 patient with hypochondriasis 27 with an anxiety disorder and 29 healthy control completed several measure which included the assessment of disgust sensitivity scale for the assessment of disgust sensitivity and disgust proneness questionnaire for the assessment of disgust proneness we found that patient with hypochondriasis and those with an anxiety disorder had higher score than those of the healthy control for several measure of disgust proneness moreover measure of hypochondriacal characteristic were associated with those of disgust proneness and disgust sensitivity however no difference were found between patient with hypochondriasis and those with anxiety disorder with respect to disgust proneness and disgust sensitivity therefore it can be assumed that disgust proneness and disgust sensitivity seem to be le specific than previously suggested for the development and maintenance of hypochondriasis,0.0

extinction learning is suggested to be a central mechanism during exposure based cognitive behavioral psychotherapy a positive association between the patient pretreatment extinction learning performance and treatment outcome would corroborate the hypothesis indeed there is first correlational evidence between reduced extinction learning and therapy efficacy however the result of these association study may be hampered by extinction training protocol that do not match treatment procedure therefore we developed an extinction training protocol highly tailored to the procedure of exposure therapy and tested it in two sample of 46 subject in total by using instructed fear acquisition training including a consolidation period overnight we wanted to ensure that the conditioned fear response wa well established prior to extinction training which is the case in patient with anxiety disorder prior to treatment moreover the extinction learning process wa analyzed on multiple response level comprising unconditioned stimulus u expectancy rating autonomic response defensive brain stem reflex and neural activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging using this protocol we found robust fear conditioning and slow speed extinction learning we also observed within group heterogeneity in extinction learning albeit a stable fear response at the beginning of the extinction training finally we found discordance between different response system suggesting that multiple process are involved in extinction learning the paradigm presented here might help to ameliorate the association between extinction learning performance assessed in the laboratory and therapy outcome and thus facilitate translational science in anxiety disorder,1.0

animal study suggest that time delay between acquisition and retrieval of contextual anxiety increase generalization moreover such generalization is prevented by preexposure to the context ctx presumably due to an improved representation of such context we investigated whether preexposure and time passing modulate generalization of contextual anxiety in human on day 1 42 participant preexposure group explored two virtual office while 41 participant no preexposure group explored a virtual stadium on day 2 24 h later all participant learned to associate one office ctx with unpredictable unconditioned stimulus us and another office ctx with safety on day 3 either 24 h recent test or 2 wk remote test later participant revisited ctx and ctx without us a well a a generalization context g ctx result revealed successfully conditioned anxiety and anxiety generalization for rating g ctx wa a aversive a ctx wa while safety generalization wa found for startle response g ctx elicited startle attenuation a ctx did time between learning and testing enhanced generalization a reflected by comparable startle response to all three office in the remote test contextual preexposure facilitated extinction of explicit conditioned anxiety assessed with rating these result suggest that memory trace of a context degrades with passage of time in human like in animal and consequently anxiety generalization enhances after context preexposure high cognitive process seem to be crucially involved in facilitating extinction or safety learning,1.0
background divergent outcome of treatment for depression occur regularly but often go undetected by clinical judgment alone to date no comprehensive study are available on what the detection rate of divergent outcome is in routine care method we analyzed a large n 20 882 database of clinician rated and patient reported outcome from routine inpatient treatment for depression result there wa little agreement 57 7 on the gaf 7 8 on the cgi i between clinician rating and patient not showing clinically significant change there wa virtually no agreement 0 6 on the gaf 2 on the cgi i between clinician rating and self report scale in deteriorated patient multiple regression showed that clinician rating of change were influenced primarily by symptom severity at discharge rather than change from admission limitation only symptom scale were available a patient reported outcome although clinician rating may be based on other source of information in addition no information wa available on clinician experience with the rating scale used nor is it clear how carefully the rating were made discussion it can be concluded that failure to achieve treatment success and worsening after routine treatment for depression often go undetected on clinical rating scale suggesting that such case frequently remain undetected clinician should generally obtain patient reported outcome during treatment to detect these case,0.0

background and objective an experimental design wa used to test whether self reported psychophysiological and symptomatic stress response increase a a function of the underlying vulnerability to psychosis a proposed by vulnerability stress model method stress response of participant with psychotic disorder psy n 35 were compared to those of participant with attenuated positive symptom a n 29 first degree relative of person with psychotic disorder rel n 26 healthy control hc n 28 and control with depression dep n 30 using a repeated measure design participant were assigned to a noise stressor a social stressor and a no stress condition in random order stress response were assessed via self report salivary cortisol level heart rate and skin conductance level state paranoia and depression were assessed with clinical scale result psy reported to be significantly more stressed than hc a and rel across all condition which went along with increased heart rate and decreased overall cortisol release in contrast a showed elevated level of cortisol psy showed a stronger response of self reported stress to the noise condition compared to the no stress condition than hc but no stronger response than the other sample furthermore the stressor did not trigger stronger psychophysiological response or symptom increase in psy limitation the social stressor wa brief and not individualized and did not have an effect on cortisol conclusion the finding support the notion that subjective stress responsiveness increase with vulnerability but not the assumption that symptom arise directly a a function of stress and vulnerability also the generally high level of arousal seem to be more relevant to psychosis than the responsiveness to specific stressor,0.0
background social anxiety and depressive symptom are relatively common in adolescent with mild to borderline intellectual disability mbid unfortunately there are only a few study that focus on examining process underlying social anxiety and depression in these adolescent aim the aim wa to examine the difference between self and peer rated likability in relation to social anxiety and depression in the classroom environment method and procedure 631 normative non clinical adolescent with mbid completed questionnaire to measure social anxiety depression and the estimation of their own likability by peer peer reported likability wa derived from peer rating scale on likability outcome and result adolescent with higher level of social anxiety significantly rated their own likability a lower than their non anxious peer however socially adolescent were equally liked by their peer adolescent with higher level of depression were significantly le liked by their peer but still underestimated their own likability than adolescent with lower level of depression conclusion and implication social anxiety and depression are linked to a biased interpretation of likability but only depression is linked to actually being le liked by peer social anxiety and depression are partly based on similar underlying cognitive bias,1.0
the processing and perception of individual internal bodily signal interoception ha been differentiated to comprise different level and process involved the so called heartbeat evoked potential hep offer an additional possibility to examine automatic processing of cardiac signal knowledge on neural structure potentially supporting different facet of interoception is still sparse one way to get insight into neuroanatomical function is to manipulate the activity of different brain structure in this study we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms and a continuous theta burst protocol to inhibit specific central location of the interoceptive network including the right anterior insula and the right somatosensory cortex and assessed effect on interoceptive facet and the hep in 18 male participant main result were that inhibiting anterior insula resulted in a significant decline in cardiac and respiratory interoceptive accuracy iac and in a consistent decrease in perception confidence continuous theta burst stimulation ctbs over somatosensory cortex reduced only cardiac iac and affected perception confidence inhibiting right anterior insula and right somatosensory cortex increased interoceptive sensibility and reduced the hep amplitude over frontocentral location our finding strongly suggest that ctbs is an effective tool to investigate the neural network supporting interoceptive process this article is part of the themed issue interoception beyond homeostasis affect cognition and mental health,1.0
distressing somatic symptom are ubiquitous both in mental disorder and medical disease from a psychometric perspective the structure of somatic symptom distress is unclear and little is known about the strength of association to related construct such a health anxiety and somatosensory amplification to clarify the structure of somatic symptom distress and to explore association to health anxiety somatosensory amplification and functional somatic syndrome data set of 2 sample of college student from germany n 1 520 and switzerland n 3 053 were investigated with confirmatory factor analysis with robust estimation a bifactor model with 1 general and 4 orthogonal specific symptom factor gastrointestinal fatigue cardio pulmonary and pain symptom revealed the best model fit medium sized association were found among latent factor of general somatic symptom distress health anxiety and depression first evidence for the construct validity of the latent variable within the proposed bifactor structure wa gained by observing a strong association between the general somatic symptom distress factor and somatosensory amplification and b significant association between both the general somatic symptom factor a well a the symptom specific factor with functional somatic syndrome the result offer a theoretically and psychometrically plausible model for the structure of somatic symptom distress and suggest a distinction between cognitive affective and sensory aspect of symptom perception the finding are compatible with current cognitive psychological and neuropsychological approach to symptom perception and imply that somatic symptom distress is a multidimensional phenomenon that is both strongly linked to but also clearly separable from related construct,1.0

recent theory propose moderate compared to high or no stressor exposure to promote emotion regulation capacity more precisely stressful situation are expected to serve a practice opportunity for cognitive reappraisal cr that is the reinterpretation of a situation to alter it emotional impact accordingly in this study we expect an inverted u shaped relationship between exposure to daily hassle and performance in a cr task that is best reappraisal ability in individual with a history of moderate stressor exposure participant n 165 reported the number of daily hassle during the last week a indicator of stressor exposure and completed the script based reappraisal test srt in the srt participant are presented with fear eliciting script and instructed to either downregulate negative affect via reappraisal reappraisal trial or react naturally control trial two measure indicate cr ability 1 reappraisal effectiveness that is the difference between affective rating in reappraisal and control trial and 2 reappraisal inventiveness that is the number of valid and categorically different reappraisal thought multiple regression analysis revealed positive linear but not quadratic relationship of exposure to daily hassle and both indicator of cr ability potential benefit of stressor exposure for emotion regulation process are discussed,0.0
background social exclusion elicits emotional distress negative mood and physiological stress recent study showed that these effect were more intense and persisting in socially anxious subject the present study examined whether the abnormal reaction of socially anxious subject can be traced back to previous experience of relational peer victimization during childhood and adolescence method participant n 74 were patient with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder a well a healthy control the patient and control group were subdivided into two subgroup according to the subject s report about previous relational peer victimization immediate and delayed physiological skin conductance level and heart rate and affective reaction to a simulated social exclusion in a ball toss game cyberball were recorded result overall subject immediate reaction to social exclusion were an increase in skin conductance and a reduction of positive affect regardless of the diagnostic status subject with a history of relational peer victimization showed a more intense self reported affective change that wa accompanied by a blunted skin conductance response however the mood of the subject with a history of peer victimization recovered during a 15 min waiting period a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder did not affect the reaction to social exclusion on any measure conclusion finding indicate that stress reaction to social exclusion depend more on previous experience of peer victimization than on a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder the finding indicate that memory of negative social experience can determine the initial stress reaction to social threat,0.0
school victimization ha been negatively associated with child s social status however previous study have primarily focused on peer victimization leaving a significant knowledge gap regarding violence by teacher we hypothesized that when almost all child experience violence by teacher not only the experience of violence but also other factor for example mental health problem may influence child s social preference and centrality we therefore examined potential moderation effect of child s internalizing and externalizing problem we implemented a multistage cluster randomized sampling approach to randomly chose fifth and sixth grade student from primary school throughout tanzania using a multi informant approach data were collected from 643 child 51 0 girl m age 12 79 year result showed inconsistent direct association between teacher violence and social status whereas mental health problem were consistently associated with lower social status significant interaction effect were found for internalizing problem that is teacher violence wa associated with lower social status for increasing internalizing problem however no interaction effect were found for externalizing problem the finding underline the burden of exposure to violence by teacher and the importance of mental health for child s social functioning knowledge about interrelation can be applied in intervention to effectively reduce violence by teacher toward student,0.0
cognitive emotion regulation is a key mechanism for the maintenance of mental health but may fail when individual are exposed to acute stress to date it is not well understood whether and to what extent acute stress effect contribute to impairment in emotion regulation capacity a the sparse existing study have yielded heterogeneous result indicating that stress timing might be a crucial factor in the present study 81 healthy participant underwent either an acute stress task scanstress c n 40 or a control condition n 41 while lying in the mri scanner in the subsequent cognitive emotion regulation task cert participant were confronted with neutral or negative picture and instructed to either view them or regulate their upcoming emotion using either distraction or reappraisal subjective rating of affective state a well a functional brain imaging data served to indicate emotion regulation the result showed a successful stress manipulation a indicated by group difference in subjective wellbeing saliva cortisol concentration heart rate and functional brain activity in region implicated in stress processing with respect to emotion regulation cert data revealed a significant regulation effect at the neural and behavioral level le negative emotional rating after reappraisal and distraction trial compared to view trial in both group however no significant group difference were observed neither in bold response to the cert nor in behavioral rating contrary to previous study our study did not reveal further evidence of stress related effect on emotion regulation potentially being related to difference between study in experimental setting timing and procedure this study therefore underline the need of future study that disentangle the complex interplay of stress and emotion regulation and identify different factor influencing their bidirectional relationship,0.0
