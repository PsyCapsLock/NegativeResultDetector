the investigation of individual difference in coping style in response to fear conditioning is an important issue for a better understanding of the etiology and treatment of psychiatric disorder it ha been assumed that an avoidant repressive coping style is characterized by increased emotion regulation effort in context of fear stimulus a compared to a more vigilant coping style however no study so far ha investigated the neural correlate of fear conditioning of repressor and sensitizer in the present fmri study 76 participant were classified a repressor or a sensitizer and were exposed to a fear conditioning paradigm in which the c predicted electrical stimulation while another neutral stimulus c did not in addition skin conductance response scrs were measured continuously a the main finding we found increased neural activity in repressor a compared to sensitizer in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex acc during fear conditioning in addition elevated activity to the c in amygdala insula occipital and orbitofrontal cortex ofc a well a elevated conditioned scrs were found in repressor the present result demonstrate increased neural activation in structure linked to emotion down regulation mechanism like the ventromedial prefrontal cortex which may reflect the increased coping effort in repressor at the same time repressor showed increased activation in arousal and evaluation associated structure like the amygdala the occipital cortex occ and the ofc which wa mirrored in increased scrs the present result support recent assumption about a two process model of repression postulating a fast vigilant response to fear stimulus and a second process associated with the down regulation of emotional response,1.0
sleep support the formation of long term memory in an active system consolidation process episodic memory encoded during wakefulness are temporarily stored in the hippocampus before they are transferred to the neocortex for the long term storage during nonrem sleep especially slow wave sleep a reactivation of hippocampal neural representation is thought to promote this transfer via synchronization of distinct oscillatory activity in hippocampus and neocortex however how this reprocessing of memory during sleep affect the memory representation in the hippocampus itself is unclear for this purpose we tested hippocampal stimulus processing i e pattern separation before and after period of sleep and wakefulness in human pattern separation refers to the capability of the hippocampus to form non overlapping orthogonal neural representation from similar episodic stimulus input we found that pattern separation performance deteriorated across the wake period but remained stable across sleep p 0 013 stimulus with highest similarity showed a reversed pattern with reduced pattern separation after sleep p with those feature of nonrem sleep serving a marker of sleep dependent memory consolidation and hippocampal reactivation our finding provide first time evidence in human supporting the notion that reactivation based consolidation process during sleep affect the hippocampal representation itself,1.0

fear generalization is thought to be an important mechanism in the acquisition and maintenance of anxiety disorder previous study have investigated fear generalization within one sensory modality mainly within the visual domain however a growing body of evidence show that emotional information is processed in more than one sensory modality based on network theory we expected that fear may also generalize from stimulus in one sensory modality to another to test our hypothesis 42 participant underwent a differential conditioning paradigm during which picture were either presented with vcs or without vcs an aversive electric stimulus after the acquisition phase generalization wa tested in the crossmodal group n 21 by presenting sound which were semantically congruent to the visual vcs i e the ag or the vcs i e the ag a a control the unimodal group n 21 saw the picture again for the crossmodal group we could show that u expectancy rating generalized from conditioned picture vcs to semantically related sound ag moreover when the vcs wa presented during extinction fear of the ag extinguished whereas extinction training with the ag wa found to be le effective for the vcs the finding are relevant for crossmodal fear acquisition and exposure therapy,1.0
background it is likely that alcohol use and abuse increase during and after violent conflict the most prominent explanation of this phenomenon ha been referred to a self medication hypothesis it predicts that psychotropic substance are consumed to deal with conflict related psychic strain and trauma in northern uganda a region that ha been affected by a devastating civil war and is characterized by high level of alcohol abuse we examined the association between war trauma childhood maltreatment and problem related to alcohol use deducing from the self medication hypothesis we assumed alcohol consumption moderate the relationship between trauma exposure and psychopathology method a cross sectional epidemiological survey targeting war affected family in post conflict northern uganda included data of male n 304 and female n 365 guardian we used standardized questionnaire in an interview format to collect data on the guardian socio demography trauma exposure alcohol consumption and symptom of alcohol abuse ptsd and depression result symptom of current alcohol use disorder were present in 46 of the male and 1 of the female respondent a multiple regression model revealed the unique contribution of emotional abuse in the family of origin and trauma experienced outside the family context in the prediction of men s alcohol related symptom we found that alcohol consumption moderated the dose effect relationship between trauma exposure and symptom of depression and ptsd significant interaction indicated that men who reported more alcohol related problem experienced le increase in symptom of ptsd and depression with increasing trauma exposure conclusion the gradual attenuation of the dose effect the more alcohol related problem were reported is consistent with the self medication hypothesis hence the functionality of alcohol consumption ha to be considered when designing and implementing addiction treatment in post conflict context,1.0
early adaptive schema ea are resilience oriented counterpart to early maladaptive schema em which are central in schema therapy the young positive schema questionnaire ypsq wa developed a a measure of ea but ha been evaluated neither in relation to a clinical population nor in a german speaking sample objective of this study were therefore the psychometric validation of a german ypsq in a community sample and the comparison of ea to psychiatric patient participant were 1 418 individual from a community sample and 182 psychiatric patient with a main diagnosis of major depressive disorder a factor structure of 10 ea instead of the original 14 demonstrated satisfactory factorial validity and internal consistency in both sample ea exhibited divergent validity to em childhood trauma and psychopathology convergent validity wa evident with resilience self efficacy and satisfaction with life support for incremental validity beyond em wa especially shown for resilience self efficacy and satisfaction with life and wa also evident for several dimension of psychopathology individual in the community sample exhibited more pronounced ea compared to psychiatric patient with the exception of empathic consideration especially for concept associated with mental health the ypsq ha the potential to be a highly valuable addition to current research and practice,1.0
physical distance is a prominent feature in face to face social interaction and allows regulating social encounter close interpersonal distance ipd increase emotional response during interaction and ha been related to avoidance behavior in social anxiety however a systematic investigation of the effect of ipd on subjective experience combined with measure of physiological arousal and behavioral response during real time social interaction ha been missing virtual reality allows for a controlled manipulation of ipd while maintaining naturalistic social encounter the present study investigates ipd in social interaction using a novel paradigm in virtual reality thirty six participant approached virtual agent and engaged in short interaction ipd wa varied between 3 5 and 1 m by manipulating the distance at which agent reacted to the participant s approach closer distance were rated a more arousing le pleasant and le natural than longer distance and this effect wa significantly modulated by social anxiety score skin conductance response were also increased at short distance compared to longer distance finally an interaction of ipd and social anxiety wa observed for avoidance behavior measured a participant backward motion during interaction with stronger avoidance related to close distance and high value of social anxiety these result highlight the influence of ipd on experience physiological response and behavior during social interaction the interaction of social anxiety and ipd suggests including the manipulation of ipd in behavioral test in virtual reality a a promising tool for the treatment of social anxiety disorder,1.0
food intake is inherently variable and often characterized by episodical restraint or overeating uncontrolled eating such heightened variability in intake ha been associated with higher variability in the brain response to food reward but it is an open issue whether comparable association with elevated variability in reward seeking exist here we assessed whether restraint and uncontrolled eating a marker of trait like variability in eating are associated with higher intra individual variability in reward seeking a captured by a cost benefit paradigm to test this hypothesis 81 healthy overnight fasting participant m bmi 23 0 kg m 2 3 0 completed an effort allocation task eat twice in the eat participant had to exert physical effort to earn monetary and food reward and indicated level of wanting through visual analog scale va a predicted we found that greater trial by trial effort variability wa associated with lower score on cognitive restraint r p 78 0 28 p 011 controlled for average effort in line with previous finding higher wanting variability wa associated with higher bmi r p 78 0 25 p 026 controlled for average effort collectively our result support the idea that higher variability in reward seeking is a potential risk factor for eating beyond homeostatic need since association with variability measure of reward exceeded association with average reward seeking our finding may indicate that variability in the representation of the reward value could be a crucial aspect driving fluctuation in food intake,1.0
the present study examined whether situational difference moderate the influence of narcissism on self promotion a the strong situation hypothesis would assume personality influence would be lowest in strong situation that include clear cue for self promotion therefore 219 participant received different situational cue no prime subliminal prime or explicit request to self present prior to the task to self describe we rated the self description to the degree of a favorable and narcissistic impression in an agentic or communal way result showed that all participant promoted themselves more favorably and narcissistically in situation with an explicit request only the impact of narcissism on self promotion wa invariant across condition it wa concluded that narcissism lead to enhanced self promotion irrespective of situational strength implication for the way we study the strong situation hypothesis are discussed,0.0
maladaptive safety behavior maintains fear and anxiety by prohibiting inhibitory learning about the non occurrence of feared outcome known a protection from extinction not engaging in safety behavior however requires to act opposite to fear motivated behavioral tendency the initiation of such fear opposite action by positive outcome which were in conflict with safety behavior wa tested following fear acquisition to a warning signal c participant acquired safety behavior to prevent the aversive outcome n 48 next safety behavior also prevented gaining reward in a control group n 50 neutral outcome were presented to control for novelty effect of the second outcome subsequently no aversive outcome occurred anymore phase with safety behavior were intermitted by phase without safety behavior being available to examine cognitive and physiological indicator of fear and anxiety without competing positive outcome safety behavior wa frequently executed persisted in absence of the aversive outcome and prohibited extinction learning positive outcome clearly reduced safety behavior despite equal level of acquired fear this enabled fear extinction a soon a the aversive outcome wa absent importantly this extinction learning resulted in attenuated fear and anxiety response when safety behavior became unavailable post hoc finding indicated that the mere anticipation of positive outcome slightly reduced safety behavior thus competing positive outcome triggered fear opposite action that prevented persistent safety behavior and protection from extinction,1.0

background and objective motivated by their fear of disapproval individual with social anxiety continually monitor their own behaviour during social interaction hoping to prevent dreaded negative outcome ironically they do evoke le positive reaction from others this study investigated whether lower engagement in the interpersonal process of joint action by socially anxious individual lead them to attract le positive rating by their conversation partner method high socially anxious hsa n 36 and low socially anxious individual lsa n 36 had separate conversation with a naive conversation partner n 36 conversation were filmed and analysed for joint action using the conventional manual way and a more exploratory automated way conversation partner rated the quality of the interaction and the person they talked to result conversation partner rated hsa participant le positively than lsa participant the conventional manual method showed le joint action in conversation with lsa participant and crucially joint action served a mediator between social anxiety status and general impression quality of interaction and desire to meet again these result were not replicated with the automated method limitation the study used an analogue sample and future research should investigate whether these finding also apply to a clinical sample future study should further explore the utility of automated technique to measure joint action conclusion reduced joint action may explain why socially anxious individual tend to be perceived le positively by others the finding emphasise the importance of taking an interpersonal and holistic approach to understanding aspect of social anxiety disorder,0.0
intolerance of uncertainty iu represents a transdiagnostic risk factor for internalizing psychopathology however little is known regarding it psychophysiological correlate iu is thought to render individual hypersensitive to threatening event even if the occurrence probability is low to test this we recruited 90 student who completed two npu threat test separating temporal unpredictability from probabilistic unpredictability i e probability of occurrence first a npu version in which the timing of threat i e shock wa either predictable or unpredictable but the shock probability wa 100 in each trial second a probabilistic npu version in which the timing of the shock wa also either predictable or unpredictable but the shock probability wa 33 in each trial startle reflex event related potential n1 and p3 locked to auditory startle probe and anxiety rating were analyzed a expected temporally unpredictable threat modulated startle n1 and anxiety rating iu predicted increased startle to lower shock probability regardless of the temporal predictability no evidence emerged for iu affecting n1 or p3 however iu predicted anxiety rating to threat condition regardless of temporal or probabilistic predictability individual difference in iu shape startle response to eventual threat iu increase automatic defensive responding to unpredictable and potentially threatening situation if the threat probability is low individual with higher iu may tend to err on the side of caution with a mismatch between physiological preparation and threat probability such that the effect of iu are particularly observable in low threat probability condition,0.0
contextual fear conditioning take place if the occurrence of threat cannot be predicted by specific cue a a consequence the context becomes the best predictor of the threat and later induces anxiety sustained fear response previous study suggest that both the amygdala and the hippocampus are crucial for contextual fear conditioning first we wanted to further elucidate the neuronal correlate of long lasting contextual threat within a highly ecologically setting created in virtual reality vr second we wanted to distinguish between initial and sustained component of the anxiety response to a threatening situation twenty four participant were guided through two virtual office for 30 each they received unpredictable electric stimulus unconditioned stimulus u in one office anxiety context cxt but never in the second office safety context cxt successful contextual fear conditioning wa indexed by higher anxiety and enhanced u expectancy rating for cxt versus cxt initial neural activity wa assessed by modeling the onset of both context and sustained neural activity by considering the entire context duration contrast cxt cxt amygdala and hippocampus revealed sustained activity initial and sustained activity were found in the middle temporal gyrus and primary motor cortex m1 additional initial activity wa obvious in orbitofrontal ofc dorsomedial dmpfc and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlpfc these result suggest that entering a threatening context initially induces conditioned fear reaction m1 recall of contingency awareness dlpfc and explicit threat appraisal dmpfc ofc while remaining in the threatening context might involve anxiety like conditioned response amygdala m1 and the generation of a spatial map to predict where and when a threatening event may occur hippocampus we conclude that in human initial versus sustained anxiety response triggered by a threat associated context are associated with distinguishable brain activation pattern involving a fear network and a contingency cognitive network respectively,1.0
behavior therapy of obsessive compulsive disorder ocd aim to reduce avoidance ritual and discomfort in ocd relevant situation the behavioral avoidance test bat measure these behavior related outcome in individually challenging ocd related situation the association of the bat with ocd severity measure and it relevance for treatment outcome is however still unclear the current study investigates 1 if reaction on the bat are related to ocd severity measure in an ocd sample n 28 2 if treatment with two variant of cognitive behavior therapy exposure and response prevention versus metacognitive therapy change the bat score and 3 if these change a well a pretreatment bat avoidance are relevant for ocd treatment outcome a measured by the yale brown obsessive compulsive scale y bocs participant rated avoidance ritual and discomfort in three individually challenging ocd related situation before and after therapy for one of these situation bat dimension were rated by the therapist and an independent rater in addition to the patient rating correlational analysis found significant correlation between bat discomfort and ocd severity measure like the y bocs a repeated measure anova with pre and posttest score showed that all three bat dimension significantly decreased during both treatment hierarchical regression analysis controlling for y bocs pretest score revealed that change in bat discomfort a well a pretreatment bat avoidance score predicted the y bocs posttest score these finding suggest that the bat is a distinct measure of behavior related outcome partly being relevant for ocd treatment outcome,1.0
one of the most robust finding in psychopathology is the fact that specific phobia are more prevalent in woman than in men although there are several theoretical account for biological and social contribution to this gender difference empirical data are surprisingly limited interestingly there is evidence that individual with stereotypical feminine characteristic are more fearful than those with stereotypical masculine characteristic this is beyond biological sex because gender role stereotype are reinforced by parental behavior we aimed to examine the relationship of maternal gender stereotype and child s fear dyad of 38 mother and their daughter between age 6 and 10 were included we assessed maternal implicit and explicit gender stereotype a well a their daughter self reported general fearfulness specific fear of snake and approach behavior toward a living snake first mother fear of snake significantly correlated with their daughter fear of snake second mother gender stereotype significantly correlated with their daughter self reported fear specifically maternal implicit gender stereotype were associated with daughter fear of snake and fear rating in response to the snake moreover in child self reported fear correlated with avoidance of the fear relevant animal together these result provide first evidence for a potential role of parental gender stereotype in the development and maintenance of fear in their offspring,1.0
diagnostic criterion for borderline personality disorder bpd include instability in identity and interpersonal relationship here we probed whether instability is already present in bpd patient thought about themselves and others we tested bpd patient n 27 and healthy control n 25 with a mind wandering task that ass content and variability of stimulus independent self generated thought multi level modeling revealed that while bpd patient and healthy control mind wander to a similar extent bpd patient thought are colored predominantly negatively most importantly although their thought concerned the self and others a much a in control they fluctuated more strongly in the degree to which their thought concerned themselves and others and also gave more extreme rating self and other related thought that were more extreme were also more negative in valence the increased variability support current conceptualization of bpd and may account for the instability in identity and interpersonal relationship,1.0
background asylum seeking child and adolescent ascs who have resettled in western country show elevated rate of psychological distress including posttraumatic stress symptom pt depression and anxiety most longitudinal data suggest a relatively stable course of symptom during the first year in exile however no longitudinal examination of the mental health of ascs who resettled in europe in the wake of the 2015 17 european migrant crisis ha been conducted so far method a prospective cohort study looked at 98 ascs who resettled in southern germany throughout 2015 17 they mainly came from afghanistan syria eritrea and iraq baseline assessment were undertaken 22 month on average after resettlement and follow up assessment 1 year thereafter seventy two ascs could be secured for the follow up the measure included self report questionnaire screening for pt depression anxiety externalizing behavior and post migration factor that were administered in an interview like setting result were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression analysis result participating ascs reported on average eight potentially traumatic experience and high level of psychological distress at baseline that had significantly declined at follow up at follow up rate of clinically significant symptom ranged from 9 7 externalizing behavior to 37 5 pt there wa considerable individual variation in symptom change resulting in multiple mental health trajectory ascs whose asylum application had been rejected presented significantly more symptom than ascs whose asylum application had been accepted between assessment baseline psychopathology and asylum status predicted follow up symptom severity conclusion in contrast to earlier study the symptom severity in this sample of ascs in germany ameliorated between assessment decision on the asylum application of ascs are thought to contribute to the course of symptom since level of psychological distress were still high dissemination and implementation of appropriate treatment for ascs is crucial,1.0
background and objective the reduction of avoidance behavior is a central target in the treatment of anxiety disorder but it ha rarely been studied how approach of fear relevant stimulus may be initiated in two study the impact of hypothetical monetary and symbolic social incentive on approach avoidance behavior wa examined method in study 1 individual high or low on fear of spider n 84 could choose to approach a fear relevant versus a neutral stimulus which were equally rewarded in a subsequent micro intervention approaching the fear relevant stimulus wa differentially rewarded either by monetary or social incentive in study 2 n 76 initial incentive for approach were discontinued to investigate the stability of approach result hypothetical monetary and symbolic social incentive reduced or eliminated initial avoidance even in highly fearful individual approach resulted in a decrease of self reported aversiveness towards the fear relevant stimulus however even after successful approach fearful individual showed significant avoidance behavior when incentive for approach were discontinued limitation future research should investigate the long term effect of prolonged approach incentive on multiple level of fear e g self report behavioral physiological it should also be tested if such an intervention actually improves compliance with exposure based intervention conclusion the present finding highlight that incentive are useful to initiate initial approach towards a feared stimulus although incentive based approach may neither fully eliminate avoidance nor negative feeling towards the feared stimulus such operant intervention may set the stage for more extensive extinction training,1.0
background comorbidities in mental disorder are often understood by assuming a common cause the network theory of mental disorder offer an alternative to this assumption by understanding comorbidities a mutually reinforced problem in this study we used network analysis to examine bridge symptom between anxiety and depression in a large sample method using data from a sample of patient diagnosed with both depression and an anxiety disorder before and after inpatient treatment n 5 614 mean age 42 24 63 59 female average treatment duration 48 12 day network model of depression and anxiety symptom are estimated topology the centrality of node stability and change in network structure are analyzed symptom that drive comorbidity are determined by bridge node analysis a an alternative to network community based on categorical diagnosis we performed a community analysis and propose empirically derived symptom subset result the obtained network model are highly stable sad mood and the inability to control worry are the most central psychomotor agitation or retardation is the strongest bridge node between anxiety and depression followed by concentration problem and restlessness change in appetite and suicidality were unique to depression community analysis revealed four symptom group conclusion the estimated network structure of depression and anxiety symptom prof to be highly accurate result indicate that some symptom are considerably more influential than others and that only a small number of predominantly physical symptom are strong candidate for explaining comorbidity future study should include physiological measure in network model to provide a more accurate understanding,1.0

introduction major depression affect over 300 million people worldwide but case are often detected late or remain undetected this increase the risk of symptom deterioration and chronification consequently there is a high demand for low threshold but clinically sound approach to depression detection recent study show a great willingness among user of mobile health apps to ass daily depression symptom in this pilot study we present a provisional validation of the depression screening app moodpath the app offer a 14 day ambulatory assessment aa of depression symptom based on the icd 10 criterion a well a ecologically momentary mood rating that allow the study of short term mood dynamic material and method n 113 moodpath user were selected through consecutive sampling and filled out the patient health questionnaire phq 9 after completing 14 day of aa with 3 question block morning midday and evening per day the psychometric property sensitivity specificity accuracy of the ambulatory moodpath screening were assessed based on the retrospective phq 9 screening result in addition several indicator of mood dynamic e g average inertia instability were calculated and investigated for their individual and incremental predictive value using regression model result we found a strong linear relationship between the phq 9 score and the aa moodpath depression score r 76 p 001 the app based screening demonstrated a high sensitivity 879 and acceptable specificity 745 different indicator of mood dynamic covered substantial amount of phq 9 variance depending on the number of day with mood data that were included in the analysis discussion aa and phq 9 shared a large proportion of variance but may not measure exactly the same construct this may be due to the difference in the underlying diagnostic system or due to difference in momentary and retrospective assessment further validation through structured clinical interview is indicated the result suggest that ambulatory assessed mood indicator are a promising addition to multimodal depression screening tool improving app based aa screening requires adapted screening algorithm and corresponding method for the analysis of dynamic process over time,1.0
panic disorder pd is characterized by a dysfunctional defensive responding to panic related body symptom that is assumed to contribute to the persistence of panic symptomatology the present study aimed at examining whether this dysfunctional defensive reactivity to panic related body symptom would no longer be present following successful cognitive behavior therapy cbt but would persist when patient show insufficient symptom improvement therefore in the present study effect of cbt on reported symptom and defensive response mobilization during interoceptive challenge were investigated using hyperventilation a a respiratory symptom provocation procedure change in defensive mobilization to body symptom in the course of cbt were investigated in patient with a primary diagnosis of pd with or without agoraphobia by applying a highly standardized hyperventilation task prior to and after a manual based cbt n 38 or a waiting period wait list control n 20 defensive activation wa indexed by the potentiation of the amygdala dependent startle eyeblink response all patient showed a pronounced defensive response mobilization to body symptom at baseline after treatment no startle reflex potentiation wa found in those patient who showed a clinically significant improvement however wait list control and treatment non responder continued to show increased defensive response to actually innocuous body symptom after the treatment waiting period the present result indicate that the elimination of defensive reactivity to actually innocuous body symptom might be a neurobiological correlate and indicator of successful cbt in patient with pd which may help to monitor and optimize cbt outcome,1.0
the error related negativity ern a neural response to error ha been associated with several form of psychopathology and assumed to represent a neural risk marker for obsessive compulsive disorder ocd and anxiety disorder yet it is still unknown which specific symptom or trait best explain ern variation this study investigated performance monitoring in participant n 100 recruited across a spectrum of obsessive compulsive characteristic n 26 patient with ocd n 74 healthy participant including n 24 with low n 24 with medium and n 26 with high oc characteristic several compulsivity and anxiety associated characteristic were assessed and submitted to exploratory principal axis factor analysis association of raw measure and derived factor with ern and correct related negativity crn were examined patient with ocd showed increased ern amplitude compared to healthy participant the ern wa associated with a variety of trait related to anxiety and negative affect factor analysis result revealed a most prominent association of the ern with a composite measure of anxiety and neuroticism whereas the crn wa specifically associated with compulsivity result support differential association for the ern and crn and demonstrate that a dimensional recruitment approach and use of composite measure can improve our understanding of characteristic underlying variation in neural performance monitoring,1.0
gaze direction and emotion expression are salient facial feature that facilitate social interaction previous study addressed how gaze direction influence the evaluation and recognition of emotion expression but few have tested how emotion expression influence attentional processing of direct versus averted gaze face the present study examined whether the prioritization of direct gaze toward the observer relative to averted gaze away from the observer is modulated by the emotional expression of the observed face participant identified target presented on the forehead of one of four face in a 2 x 2 design gaze direction direct averted motion sudden static emotion expression of the face neutral angry fearful happy disgusted differed across participant direct gaze effect emerged response time were shorter for target on direct gaze than on averted gaze face this direct gaze effect wa enhanced in angry face approach oriented and reduced in fearful face avoidance oriented weaker approach and avoidance oriented expression happy and disgusted did not modulate the direct gaze effect these finding suggest that the context of facial emotion expression influence attentional processing psycinfo database record c 2023 apa all right reserved,0.0
face and voice are prominent cue for person identity recognition face recognition behavior and associated brain response can be enhanced by intranasal administration of oxytocin it is unknown whether oxytocin can also augment voice identity recognition mechanism to find it out is particularly relevant for individual who have difficulty recognizing voice identity such a individual diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder asd we conducted a combined behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri study to investigate voice identity recognition following intranasal administration of oxytocin or placebo in a group of adult diagnosed with asd full scale intelligence quotient 85 and pairwise matched typically developing td control a single dose of 24 iu oxytocin wa administered in a randomized double blind placebo controlled and cross over design in the control group but not in the asd group administration of oxytocin compared to placebo increased response to recognition of voice identity in contrast to speech in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus gyrus pst g a region implicated in the perceptual analysis of voice identity information in the asd group the right pst g response were positively correlated with voice identity recognition accuracy in the oxytocin condition but not in the placebo condition oxytocin did not improve voice identity recognition performance at the group level the asd compared to the control group had lower right pst g response to voice identity recognition since asd is known to have atypical pst g the result indicate that the potential of intranasal oxytocin to enhance mechanism for voice identity recognition might be variable and dependent on the functional integrity of this brain region,0.0
the beck depression inventory ii is one of the most frequently used scale to ass depressive burden despite many psychometric evaluation it factor structure is still a topic of debate an increasing number of article using fully symmetrical bifactor model have been published recently however they all produce anomalous result which lead to psychometric and interpretational difficulty to avoid anomalous result the bifactor s 1 approach ha recently been proposed a alternative for fitting bifactor structure the current article compare the applicability of fully symmetrical bifactor model and symptom oriented bifactor s 1 and first order confirmatory factor analysis model in a large clinical sample n 3 279 of adult the result suggest that bifactor s 1 model are preferable when bifactor structure are of interest since they reduce problematic result observed in fully symmetrical bifactor model and give the g factor an unambiguous meaning otherwise symptom oriented first order confirmatory factor analysis model present a reasonable alternative,1.0
individual suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder ocd have been found to show deficit in implicitly learning probabilistic association between event neuroimaging study have associated these implicit learning deficit in ocd individual with aberrant activation of the striatal system recent behavioral study have highlighted that probabilistic classification learning pcl deficit in ocd individual only occur in a disorder specific context while pcl remains intact in a neutral context the neural correlate of implicit learning in an ocd specific context however have not yet been investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a neutral prediction of weather and an ocd specific variant prediction of a virus epidemic of a pcl paradigm we assessed brain activity associated with implicit learning process in 10 participant with ocd and 10 matched healthy control region of interest roi were the striatum and the medial temporal lobe roi analysis revealed a significantly higher activity in the bilateral putamen and the left hippocampus of ocd participant a compared to healthy control during both pcl task the group difference could partly be subsumed under a group x task interaction effect with ocd participant showing a significantly higher activity than healthy control in the left putamen and the left hippocampus in the ocd specific task variant only these result suggest a compensation of aberrant striatal activity by an augmented engagement of the explicit memory system particularly in a disorder relevant context in ocd participant,1.0
appearance teasing is a common phenomenon in social interaction especially in adolescence several study have shown it negative impact on mental health a well a on body image while these finding prove stable in various context le evidence is available for possible gender difference in these relationship in particular the role of two important body image variable appearance based rejection sensitivity ar and dysmorphic concern and their contribution to mental health impairment ha not been assessed in gender specific process model in a cross sectional survey study n 501 407 f 94 m we retrospectively assessed early appearance teasing experience a well a current ar dysmorphic concern depression anxiety and self esteem we analyzed gender difference in these variable and their interrelation we then examined the mediating role of ar and dysmorphic concern in explaining mental health variable in adulthood due to early appearance teasing in gender specific serial mediation model the result show high ratio of early teasing experience but no significant gender difference regarding the frequency of early appearance teasing while teasing experience were significantly related to body image variable in adulthood in both gender r 0 32 p 0 010 we observed significant relation with mental health outcome in woman r 0 30 p 0 001 but not in men r 0 20 p 0 250 serial mediation model show that ar and dysmorphic concern mediate the effect of appearance teasing on mental health in all outcome in woman deltar 2 0 17 but not in men deltar 2 0 03 finding remained stable when controlling for body mass index age and relationship status the finding show similar frequency of appearance teasing and associated negative effect on body image in men and woman specifically in woman the effect of teasing on mental health were stronger and mediated by ar and dysmorphic concern overall the result point to the relevance of ar for etiological model of body image disorder and female mental health however men did not show the same relationship of teasing and mental health differential resilience factor regarding the negative effect of early appearance teasing could be an important target for future research,0.0
metacognitive therapy mct ha been shown to be a promising treatment approach for obsessive compulsive disorder ocd the changeability of metacognitions by metacognitive treatment and it relevance to treatment outcome is however still unclear the current study investigates 1 if treatment with mct or exposure and response prevention erp in a randomized controlled pilot trial n 24 patient with ocd change ocd specific metacognitions of thought fusion belief belief about ritual and stop signal and 2 if these change are relevant for the treatment outcome in term of patient and therapist rated ocd symptom anova with pretest posttest and follow up score could show that all three metacognitions significantly decreased during both treatment regarding thought fusion belief a significant interaction effect indicated a higher decrease after mct than erp treatment in hierarchical regression analysis change in stop signal from pre to post treatment significantly predicted patient rating ocd symptom at post treatment and follow up at 3 month after treatment these change were even predictive of post treatment outcome after controlling for general metacognitions and dysfunctional cognitive belief these finding support the assumption that metacognitions can change during both treatment and that change in stop signal might be relevant for the treatment outcome on the symptom level in ocd,1.0
since the covid 19 outbreak addictive social medium use increased in many country to better understand this development a universal instrument for the assessment of addictive social medium use is required against this background we examined the psychometric property of the bergen social medium addiction scale bsmas in representative population sample in nine country n 9418 age range 18 to 24 year youngest group 55 year and older oldest group china france germany poland russia spain sweden u k u s furthermore we investigated potential factor and mechanism that could be associated with addictive social medium use our cross national finding show that the bsmas is a unidimensional reliable and valid instrument moreover they reveal that the negative association between positive mental health and addictive social medium use is mediated by sense of control in seven of the nine country exception china russia thus it can be hypothesized that activity which increase positive mental health could indirectly contribute to the decrease of addictive social medium use we identified conscious engagement in physical activity and a regular sleep rhythm during the pandemic a such potential activity the fostering of both by governmental program could enhance positive mental health and reduce addictive social medium use,1.0
