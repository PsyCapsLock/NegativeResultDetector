background and objective attention avoidance of feedback related stimulus is proposed to be associated with and maintain social anxiety however previous research ha mainly focused on comparing the attention bias between two type of stimulus while little is known about attention distribution pattern among positive neutral and negative feedback and non feedback stimulus in individual with high trait social anxiety hsa or low trait social anxiety lsa method the current study assessed eye movement pattern of participant with hsa or lsa during a speech task high anxiety condition or while solely watching audience feedback of the speech low anxiety condition a pre recorded audience who displayed approving neutral or disapproving gesture wa presented a feedback stimulus while neutral facial photo were used a non feedback stimulus result only in the high anxiety condition participant with hsa exhibited longer total fixation on non feedback stimulus compared to those with lsa whereas in the low anxiety condition both group paid more attention to emotional feedback stimulus limitation the final sample size wa modest due to a high suspicion rate of the reality of the audience conclusion these finding suggest that only in highly anxious social situation socially anxious individual lack the attentional preference toward positive feedback that individual with low anxious have,1.0
abstract background child with selective mutism sm are consistently unable to speak in certain social situation due to an overlap between sm and social anxiety disorder sad in child similar mechanism could apply to both disorder especially biased attentional processing of threat and fear induced reduced visual exploration referred to a attentive freezing appear promising in sm method a total of n 84 child 8 12 year sm n 28 sad n 28 typical development td n 28 participated in an eye tracking paradigm with video of a social counterpart expressing a question a social evaluation or a neutral statement we investigated gaze behavior towards the social counterpart s eye region and the extent of visual exploration length of scanpath across condition result there were no group difference regarding gaze behavior on the eye region neither gaze behavior with respect to the eye region nor visual exploration were dependent on the video condition compared to child with td child with sm generally showed le visual exploration however child with sad did not conclusion reduced visual exploration might be due to the mechanism of attentive freezing which could be part of an extensive fear response in sm that might also affect speech production intervention that counteract the state of freezing could be promising for the therapy of sm,0.0
working memory wm performance decline with age however several study have shown that wm training may lead to performance increase not only in the trained task but also in untrained cognitive transfer task it ha been suggested that transfer effect occur if training task and transfer task share specific processing component that are supposedly processed in the same brain area in the current study we investigated whether single task wm training and training related alteration in neural activity might support performance in a dual task setting thus assessing transfer effect to higher order control process in the context of dual task coordination a sample of older adult age 60 72 wa assigned to either a training or control group the training group participated in 12 session of an adaptive n back training at pre and post measurement a multimodal dual task wa performed in all participant to ass transfer effect this task consisted of two simultaneous delayed match to sample wm task using two different stimulus modality visual and auditory that were performed either in isolation single task or in conjunction dual task a subgroup also participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri during the performance of the n back task before and after training while no transfer to single task performance wa found dual task cost in both the visual modality p 0 05 and the auditory modality p 0 05 decreased at post measurement in the training but not in the control group in the fmri subgroup of the training participant neural activity change in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dlpfc during one back predicted post training auditory dual task cost while neural activity change in right dlpfc during three back predicted visual dual task cost result might indicate an improvement in central executive processing that could facilitate both wm and dual task coordination,0.0
anxiety is often characterised by an overestimation of the contingency between concern relevant and aversive stimulus and an amplified aversiveness of such aversive stimulus here we tested whether outcome aversiveness causally enhances contingency estimate twenty four participant were exposed to neutral visual cue which were followed by startle sound the loudness and hence the aversiveness of the cue wa determined by the cue colour while the likelihood of the startle sound always remained constant 50 result indicated an illusory correlation specifically for the cue followed by the most aversive startle sound a reflected in enhanced on line and a posteriori covariation estimate this bias wa positively correlated with state and trait anxiety physiological arousal measured by pupil diameter wa enhanced in response to the most aversive startle sound confirming it distinct processing in conclusion these result suggest that aversive outcome may induce illusory correlation most likely in anxious person and explain previous finding of illusory correlation in anxiety disorder,1.0
touch can be highly emotional and depending on the environment it can be perceived a pleasant and comforting or disgusting and dangerous here we studied the impact of context on the processing of tactile stimulus using a functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri paradigm this wa achieved by embedding tactile stimulation in a variable olfactory environment twenty people were scanned with bold fmri while receiving the following stimulus block slow stroking touch civette odor feces like rose odor touch civette and touch rose rating of pleasantness and intensity of tactile stimulus and rating of disgust and intensity of olfactory stimulus were collected the impact of the olfactory context on the processing of touch wa studied using covariance analysis coupling between olfactory processing and somatosensory processing area wa assessed with psychophysiological interaction analysis ppi a subjectively disgusting olfactory environment significantly reduced the perceived pleasantness of touch the touch fmri activation in the secondary somatosensory cortex operculum 1 op1 wa positively correlated with the disgust towards the odor decreased pleasantness of touch wa related to decreased posterior insula activity ppi analysis revealed a significant interaction between the op1 posterior insula and region processing the disgust of odor orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala we conclude that the disgust evaluation of the olfactory environment moderate neural reactivity in somatosensory region by upregulation of the op1 and downregulation of the posterior insula this adaptive regulation of affective touch processing may facilitate adaptive reaction to a potentially harmful stimulus,1.0
oral contraceptive oc and endogenous female sex hormone in naturally cycling woman nc are related to a wide range of psychological variable eg cognition and affect little research on social behavior ha been done one study documented a tendency towards more prosocial behavior in nc than oc woman but the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism remain unknown the sex hormone progesterone and estradiol are potential candidate we analyzed social decision making and social behavior in 83 healthy woman 38 oc and 45 nc via the social value orientation svo and in real social interaction within a paradigm adapted from behavioral economics we also measured empathy and collected saliva sample to quantify the basal level of estradiol and progesterone our analysis revealed higher level of prosocial behavior and emotional empathy in nc than in oc woman a finding supported by higher level of prosocial decision in nc than oc woman in the svo regarding the underlying biological mechanism we detected lower progesterone level in oc than nc woman exploratory analysis revealed a negative correlation between progesterone and trust on the trend level we found no correlation between estradiol and behavior our finding provide evidence that oc modulate social behavior and initial indication of a possible modulation by progesterone further research is needed to replicate our finding and extend them to other social behavior,0.0
background although chronic depression is associated with lower global functioning and poorer treatment response than episodic depression little is known about the difference between these two form of depression in term of psychological factor thus the present study aimed at differentiating chronic and episodic depression regarding cognitive behavioral and emotional avoidance that have been proposed a important risk factor for depression and promising target for the treatment of depression method thirty patient with early onset chronic depression were compared with 30 patient with episodic depression and 30 healthy never depressed control in term of self reported cognitive behavioral social and non social and emotional avoidance result chronically depressed patient reported more avoidance than healthy control in each of the measure moreover they reported more cognitive nonsocial and behavioral nonsocial a well a behavioral social and emotional avoidance in the form of restricted emotional expression to others than patient with episodic depression this kind of emotional avoidance also separated best between chronically and episodically depressed patient furthermore general emotion avoidance and behavioral social avoidance were positively correlated with level of depression in chronically depressed patient limitation the result are based on self report data and should thus be interpreted with caution additionally the cross sectional design limit any causal conclusion conclusion the finding underscore the relevance of cognitive behavioral and emotional avoidance in differentiating chronic from episodic depression and healthy control and advocate a stronger focus on maladaptive avoidance process in the treatment of chronic depression,1.0
judgment of well being is formed on the spot and we know little about it foundation we aimed at examining the role of comparison standard in informing evaluation of well being in a clinical and a nonclinical sample in a semi structured face to face interview individual seeking psychological treatment and healthy control individual rated how they have been feeling in general and relative to specific comparison standard and were each time invited to substantiate their rating independent coder assessed number type direction and specificity of reported comparison when asked to explain why they chose a particular rating of their well being 93 of clinical participant and 61 of nonclinical participant spontaneously reported some type of comparison standard both group reported highest well being rating relative to social and past temporal comparison and lowest relative to prospective temporal comparison furthermore clinical participant engaged in more upward than downward comparison whereas this wa not the case for healthy control participant our finding suggest that evaluation of well being are informed by different comparison type and that individual with clinical complaint use more comparison when evaluating their well being the result encourage further investigation of comparative thinking a an underlying mechanism of judgment of well being and ill being,1.0
the perception of pain to noxious stimulus also known a pain sensitivity varies among individual the comprised brain structure and their white matter pathway are complex and elusive here we aimed to investigate whether variation of microstructure of the medial forebrain bundle mfb a tract connecting the basal forebrain with the brain stem is associated with interindividual pain sensitivity we assessed interindividual pain sensitivity a a rating of pain intensity to heat stimulus 45 47 and 48 9 degree c in 38 healthy men age 27 05 5 7 year we also reconstructed the mfb using multitensor tractography from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging dmri and calculated free water corrected dmri measure of fractional anisotropy fa t radial diffusivity rd t and axial diffusivity ad t lower rating of interindividual pain intensity correlated with higher fa t and lower rd t of the mfb a change in fa t and rd t may reflect abnormality in myelination the result might be interpreted a that a lower pain rating is associated with higher degree of myelination of the mfb and could represent an inhibitory pathway of pain our result suggest that alteration of microstructure in the mfb contributes to the interindividual variation of pain perception,1.0
background major depressive disorder mdd is characterized by a high risk for relapse and chronic development clinical characteristic such a residual symptom have been shown to negatively affect the long term course of mdd however it is unclear so far how trait repetitive negative thinking rnt a well a cognitive and affective momentary state the latter experienced during daily life affect the long term course of mdd method we followed up 57 remitted depressed rmdd individual six t2 and 36 t3 month after baseline clinical outcome were time to relapse time spent with significant symptom a a marker of chronicity and level of depressive symptom at t2 and t3 predictor assessed at baseline included residual symptom and trait rnt furthermore momentary daily life affect and momentary rumination and their variation over the day were assessed at baseline using ambulatory assessment aa result in multiple model residual symptom and instability of daily life affect at baseline independently predicted a faster time to relapse while chronicity wa significantly predicted by trait rnt multilevel model revealed that depressive symptom level during follow up were predicted by baseline residual symptom level and by instability of daily life rumination both instability feature were linked to a higher number of anamnestic mdd episode conclusion our finding indicate that trait rnt but also affective and cognitive process during daily life impact the longer term course of mdd future longitudinal research on the role of respective aa phenotype a potential transdiagnostic course modifier is warranted,1.0
perceptual integration of sensory input from our two nostril ha received little attention in comparison to lateralized input for vision and hearing here we investigated whether a binary odor mixture of eugenol and l carvone smell of clove and caraway would be perceived differently if presented a a mixture in one nostril physical mixture v the same two odorants in separate nostril dichorhinic mixture in parallel we investigated whether the different type of presentation resulted in difference in olfactory event related potential oerp psychophysical rating showed that the dichorhinic mixture were perceived a more intense than the physical mixture a tendency for shift in perceived quality wa also observed in line with these perceptual change the oerp showed a shift in latency and amplitude for early more sensory peak p1 and n1 whereas no significant difference were observed for the later more cognitive peak p2 the result altogether suggest that the peripheral level is a site of interaction between odorants both psychophysical rating and for the first time electrophysiological measurement converge on this conclusion,0.0
social exclusion affect mental and physical health the ability to regulate emotional response to social exclusion is therefore essential for our well being a individual difference in detecting bodily signal interoceptive sensitivity is have been associated with the ability of emotion regulation we aimed at exploring whether is foster coping with social exclusion and flexibility in emotion regulation the first study investigated subjective feeling and behavioral affiliation tendency in response to ostracism using a cyberball paradigm sixty nine participant were assessed who differed with respect to is the second study examined habitual emotion regulation process focusing on suppression and reappraisal a well a is in 116 participant main result were that the effect of ostracism on distress and behavioral affiliation tendency were qualified by is being ostracized had le impact on participant with stronger is furthermore study 2 revealed that is wa associated with habitually stronger emotion regulation strategy we conclude that having access to bodily signal help is reducing aversive state provoked by social exclusion probably due to the fact that is is associated with emotion regulation strategy,1.0
background and objective dual process model posit that addictive behavior are characterized by strong automatic process that can be assessed with implicit measure the present study investigated the potential of a cognitive bias modification paradigm the approach avoidance task aat for retraining automatic behavioral tendency in cigarette smoking method the study wa set up a an online intervention after completing an online survey 257 smoker were randomly allocated either to one of two experimental condition aat or a waitlist control group participant responded to different picture by pushing or pulling the computer mouse depending on the format of the picture picture in portrait format depicted smoking related item and were associated with pushing picture in landscape format depicted neutral item and were associated with pulling one version of the aat provided individual feedback after each trial whereas the standard version did not after four week participant were re assessed in an online survey result analysis revealed that the standard aat in particular led to a significant reduction in cigarette consumption cigarette dependence and compulsive drive no effect wa found in the control group limitation interpretability of the study is constrained by the fact that no active control condition wa applied conclusion notwithstanding the limitation our finding indicate that the aat might be a feasible instrument to reduce tobacco dependence and can be applied a an online intervention future study should investigate whether the effect of behavior therapy can be augmented when combined with retraining intervention,0.0
this is the first study to investigate multiple cognitive bias in adolescence simultaneously to examine whether anxiety and depression are associated with bias in attention and interpretation and whether these bias are able to predict unique variance in self reported level of anxiety and depression a total of 681 adolescent performed a dot probe task dpt an emotional visual search task evst and an interpretation recognition task attention and interpretation bias were significantly correlated with anxiety mixed result were reported with regard to depression evidence wa found for an interpretation bias and for an attention bias a measured with the evst but not with the dpt furthermore interpretation and attention bias predicted unique variance in anxiety and depression score these result indicate that attention and interpretation bias are unique process in anxiety and depression they also suggest that anxiety and depression are partly based on similar underlying cognitive mechanism,0.0

previous research revealed an automatic behavioral bias in high socially anxious individual hsas although their explicit evaluation of smiling face are positive they show automatic avoidance of these face this is reflected by faster pushing than pulling of smiling face in an approach avoidance task aat heuer et al 2007 the current study addressed the causal role of this avoidance bias for social anxiety to this end we used the aat to train hsas either to approach smiling face or to avoid them we examined whether such an aat training could change hsas automatic avoidance tendency and if yes whether aat effect would generalize to a new approach task with new facial stimulus and to mood and anxiety in a social threat situation a video recorded self presentation we found that hsas trained to approach smiling face did indeed approach female face faster after the training than hsas trained to avoid smiling face moreover approach face training reduced emotional vulnerability it led to more positive mood and lower anxiety after the self presentation than avoid face training these result suggest that automatic approach avoidance tendency have a causal role in social anxiety and that they can be modified by a simple computerized training this may open new avenue in the therapy of social phobia,1.0
objective amotivation is a common symptom in various mental disorder including psychotic or depressive disorder effort based decision making ebdm task quantifying amotivation at a behavioral level have been on the rise task performance ha been shown to differentiate patient group from healthy control however finding on indicator of construct validity such a the correlation between different task and between task and self reported observer rated amotivation in clinical and healthy sample have been inconclusive method in a representative community sample n 90 we tested the construct validity of the deck choice task the expenditure for reward task and the balloon task we calculated correlation between the ebdm task and between the ebdm task and self reported amotivation apathy anticipatory pleasure and bi ba result correlation between task were low to moderate 0 198 r 0 358 with the balloon task showing the largest correlation with the other task but no significant correlation between any ebdm task and the self report measure conclusion although different ebdm task are conceptualized to measure the same construct a large part of what each task measure could not be accounted for by the other task moreover the task did not appear to substantially capture what wa measured in established self report instrument for amotivation in our sample which could be interpreted a questioning the construct validity of ebdm task,0.0
rationale although there is evidence that impaired executive functioning play a role in addictive behavior the longitudinal relationship between the two remains relatively unknown objective in a prospective longitudinal community study we tested the hypothesis that lower executive functioning is associated with more addictive behavior at one point in time and over time method three hundred and thirty eight individual 19 27 year 59 female from a random community sample were recruited into three group addictive disorder related to substance n 100 or to behavior n 118 or healthy control n 120 at baseline participant completed nine executive function task from which a latent variable of general executive functioning gef wa derived addictive behavior i e quantity and frequency of use and number of dsm 5 criterion met were assessed using standardized clinical interview at baseline and three annual follow ups the trajectory of addictive behavior were examined using latent growth curve modeling result at baseline we found weak to no evidence of an association between gef and addictive behavior we found evidence for an association between a lower gef at baseline and a higher increase in the quantity of use and a smaller decrease in frequency of use over time but no evidence for an association with an increase in the number of dsm 5 criterion met conclusion lower efs appear to lead to a continuing loss of control over use whereas addictive disorder may develop secondarily after a long period of risky use previous etiological model assuming lower ef a a direct vulnerability factor for addictive disorder need to be refined,0.0
fear response are typically not limited to the actual threatening stimulus but generalize to other stimulus resembling the threatening stimulus although this fear generalization is generally adaptive fear overgeneralization is maladaptive and assumed to contribute to anxiety disorder despite the clinical relevance of fear over generalization how the extent of fear generalization is modulated remains not well understood based on the known effect of stress on learning and memory we tested here the impact of major stress mediator glucocorticoid and noradrenergic arousal on fear generalization in a laboratory based placebo controlled double blind between subject design 125 healthy participant first underwent a fear conditioning procedure about 24 h later participant received orally either a placebo hydrocortisone the alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine leading to increased noradrenergic stimulation or both drug before a test of fear generalization skin conductance response a well a explicit rating data revealed that yohimbine intake led to enhanced fear memory expression i e an enhanced responding to the c but not to stimulus resembling the c moreover neither enhanced safety learning nor a mere enhancement of perceptual discrimination ability could explain this result in contrast to yohimbine hydrocortisone had no significant effect on fear memory these finding suggest that noradrenergic arousal strengthens fear memory expression and have important implication for mental disorder in which the overgeneralization of conditioned fear is prominent,0.0

background and objective cognitive restructuring and imagery modification for ptsd crim ptsd is a new short intervention it consists of the cognitive restructuring of core trauma related dysfunctional belief about the self and the use of imagery to encourage more functional belief a randomized controlled trial showed that crim wa effective for reducing posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd in survivor of childhood sexual abuse csa when it focused on the feeling of being contaminated for this study crim wa adapted to treat ptsd symptom more generally and after various type of trauma by addressing the patient negative self concept method ten patient with ptsd received two assessment session two treatment session and a booster session the clinician administered ptsd scale cap wa administered prior to and four week after treatment self rating e g the posttraumatic diagnostic scale pd and the posttraumatic cognition inventory ptci were administered at baseline immediately posttreatment and four week after treatment result the participant showed significant improvement in both clinician rated d 2 55 p 0 01 and self reported ptsd symptom d 1 47 p 0 01 one month after treatment 9 patient no longer fully met the diagnostic criterion for ptsd limitation the result are limited by the small sample size and the lack of a control group conclusion this pilot study suggests that addressing the negative self concept of ptsd patient using a combination of cognitive technique and imagery modification can effectively reduce ptsd symptom further research is needed to ass the treatment s effect and stability in a randomized controlled trial,1.0
learning is blocked when a stimulus is followed by an outcome that is identical to what wa expected and thus contains no new information this classic blocking effect exemplifies that learning is driven by the predictive value of stimulus which in turn should guide the allocation of attentional resource stress is known to be a powerful modulator of learning and memory however whether stress may affect attentional processing during predictive learning is largely unknown here we combined electroencephalography and eye tracking with an experimental stress manipulation and a fear conditioning paradigm designed to probe the blocking effect to determine if and how stress impact efficient attentional processing during predictive learning participant explicit rating indicated irrespective of stress a blocking effect the control group further showed preferential attentional processing of predictive v unpredictive stimulus reflected in differential fixation duration and a differential n2pc stress abolished this differentiation and led even to sustained attention indicated by higher late positive potential to stimulus with low predictive value moreover stress resulted in an overall increase in the p3b during the blocking phase suggesting increased attentional processing presumably due to impaired access to previously learned association together our result suggest that while control participant paid particular attention to predictive stimulus and reduced attention to unpredictive stimulus in line with the classic blocking effect stress before learning reduced this preferential processing thus the present finding highlight the role of attention allocation for predictive fear learning and suggest that stress may impair efficient information processing against the background of prior experience,1.0
the perception of time is a fundamental part of human experience recent research suggests that the experience of time emerges from emotional and interoceptive bodily state a processed in the insular cortex whether there is an interaction between the conscious awareness of interoceptive state and time distortion induced by emotion ha rarely been investigated so far we aimed to address this question by the use of a retrospective time estimation task comparing two group of participant one group had a focus on interoceptive state and one had a focus on exteroceptive information while watching film clip depicting fear amusement and neutral content main result were that attention to interoceptive process significantly affected subjective time experience fear wa accompanied with subjective time dilation that wa more pronounced in the group with interoceptive focus while amusement led to a quicker passage of time which wa also increased by interoceptive focus we conclude that retrospective temporal distortion are directly influenced by attention to bodily response these effect might crucially interact with arousal level sympathetic nervous system activation affecting memory build up might be the decisive factor influencing retrospective time judgment our data substantially extend former research finding underscoring the relevance of interoception for the effect of emotional state on subjective time experience,1.0

purpose orthorexic eating behaviour restrained eating and veganism vegetarianism are food selection strategy sharing several characteristic since there are no study investigating their interrelationship aim of the present study wa to analyse orthorexic and restrained eating behaviour in 1 a sample of vegan and vegetarian and 2 a sample of individual on a diet to lose weight method division of sample according to pre defined criterion in 1 vegan n 114 vegetarian n 63 individual with rare meat consumption n 83 and individual with frequent meat consumption n 91 and in 2 participant on a diet with dietary change n 104 without dietary change n 37 and a control group of individual not on a diet n 258 orthorexic eating behaviour wa assessed with the dusseldorfer orthorexie skala and restrained eating wa assessed with the restraint eating scale result vegan and vegetarian do not differ in orthorexic eating behaviour but both group score higher in orthorexic eating behaviour than individual consuming red meat there are no difference regarding restrained eating individual on a diet with dietary change score higher in both orthorexic and restrained eating than individual without dietary change and individual not on a diet conclusion individual who restrict their eating behaviour either predominantly due to ethical reason or with the intention to lose weight display more orthorexic eating behaviour than individual not limiting their food consumption further research is needed to investigate whether veganism vegetarianism or frequent dieting behaviour serve a risk factor for orthorexia level of evidence level v cross sectional descriptive study,0.0
between group comparison are permissible and meaningfully interpretable only if diagnostic instrument are proved to measure the same latent dimension across different group addressing this issue the present study wa carried out to provide a rigorous test of measurement invariance confirmatory factor analysis were used to determine which model solution could best explain memory performance a measured by the wechsler memory scale fourth edition wms iv in a clinical depression sample and in healthy control multigroup confirmatory factor analysis wa conducted to evaluate the evidence for measurement invariance a three factor model solution including the dimension of auditory memory visual memory and visual working memory wa identified to best fit the data in both sample and measurement invariance wa partially satisfied the result supported clinical utility of the wms iv that is auditory and visual memory performance of patient with depressive disorder are interpretable on the basis of the wms iv standardization data however possible difference in visual working memory function between healthy and depressed individual could restrict comparison of the wms iv working memory index,0.0
background stress and stress hormone modulate memory formation in various way that are relevant to our understanding of stress related psychopathology such a posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd particular relevance is attributed to efficient memory formation sustained by the hippocampus and parahippocampus this process is thought to reduce the occurrence of intrusion and flashback following trauma but may be negatively affected by acute stress moreover recent evidence suggests that the efficiency of visuo spatial processing and learning based on the hippocampal area is related to ptsd symptom objective the current study investigated the effect of acute stress on spatial configuration learning using a spatial contextual cueing task scct known to heavily rely on structure in the parahippocampus method acute stress wa induced by subjecting participant n 34 to the maastricht acute stress test mast following a counterbalanced within subject approach the effect of stress and the ensuing hormonal i e cortisol activity on subsequent scct performance were compared to scct performance following a no stress control condition result acute stress did not impact scct learning overall but opposing effect emerged for high versus low cortisol responder to the mast learning score following stress were reduced in low cortisol responder while high cortisol responding participant showed improved learning conclusion the effect of stress on spatial configuration learning were moderated by the magnitude of endogenous cortisol secretion these finding suggest a possible mechanism by which cortisol response serve an adaptive function during stress and trauma and this may prove to be a promising route for future research in this area,0.0
negative priming np is assumed to indicate the effect of an inhibitory mechanism in selective attention previous study showed inconsistent reduction of the np effect in patient with obsessive compulsive disorder ocd and schizophrenia the aim of the present study wa to relate np alteration in two different np task with specific symptom pattern of ocd and schizophrenia patient twenty eight patient with a diagnosis of ocd 27 patient with schizophrenia and 27 healthy comparison participant performed a spatial and an identity priming task robust np effect were found in the spatial priming task across group and symptom pattern however ocd patient with a predominance of obsessive thought a well a schizophrenia patient with predominantly positive symptom showed no identity np effect whereas ocd patient who primarily presented with compulsive ritual and schizophrenia patient with predominant negative symptom tended to have increased identity np compared to healthy participant it is concluded that obsession a well a positive psychotic symptom are related to identity np deficit possibly reflecting a shared basic cognitive mechanism leading to deficient thought control,0.0
a milestone of child development is theory of mind tom the ability to attribute mental state especially belief and desire to other person and to understand that their behavior is guided by mental state the learning process about the mental world also take place in social communication and interaction beginning in infancy infancy is assumed to be a sensitive period for the development of social skill through interaction due to limited self regulatory skill infant depend on sensitive behavior of their caregiver to regulate affective state and physiological arousal and in turn mutually regulated affect allow the infant to gradually acquire the capability to self regulate negative affective state effective and adequate affect regulation is an important prerequisite for environmental interaction and thus for the development of socio emotional skill the present study investigated the relation of self regulatory ability in infancy and later tom in pre school aged child of clinically depressed mother and healthy control the sample comprised of n 55 mother child dyad n 22 diagnosed with postpartum or lifetime depression according to dsm iv and n 33 healthy control mother infant interaction wa videotaped during the face to face still face paradigm at 3 and 42 month postpartum mother were interviewed with the structured clinical interview for dsm iv axis i disorder scid i to evaluate maternal psychopathological status according to dsm iv at the age of m 4 0 year child s tom ability were assessed using content false belief and location false belief task the result of this study show that contrary to our hypothesis maternal depression did not impair the development of child s tom ability per se rather an interaction effect highlight the role of infant s self comforting behavior during mother infant interaction in infancy 3 month postpartum for tom development at pre school age assessed with the maxi task this association wa distinct for female in comparison to male child the result of this longitudinal study shed light on the discussion how maternal depression influence child development and point in the direction that self comforting behavior in infancy can also be seen a a resource,0.0

cognitive theory of anxiety suggest that anxious child interpret negatively only those material specifically related to the content of their anxiety so far there are only a few study available that report on this postulated content specificity of interpretation process across different anxiety disorder in child and most of them focused on social anxiety therefore we examined interpretation bias and it content specificity in a group of clinically anxious child between the age of 6 12 year with various anxiety disorder using an ambiguous scenario task child were asked to finish scenario that were related to either social threat general threat or separation threat in total 105 clinically anxious child 21 control child and their mother were assessed with the adis c p and the spence child s anxiety scale a expected clinically anxious child provided significantly more negative ending to the scenario than control child within the clinically anxious group specific interpretation bias were found interpretation of scenario related to social threat general threat and separation threat were only predicted by the child s self reported level of social anxiety generalized anxiety and separation anxiety respectively these finding support the content specificity hypothesis that clinically anxious child display interpretation bias that are specific to fear relevant stimulus,1.0
our ability to infer other individual emotion is central for successful social interaction based on the theory of embodied simulation our mirror neuron system mn provides the essential link between the observed facial configuration of another individual and our inference of the emotion by mean of common neuronal activation however so far it is unknown whether the mn differentiates the valence of facial configuration to increase the precision of our fmri measurement we used an adaptation design which allows insight into whether the same neuronal population is active for subsequent stimulus of facial configuration 76 participant were shown congruent or incongruent consecutive pair of facial configuration expressing fear or happiness significant activation for change in emotional valence from adaptor to target wa revealed in fusiform gyrus superior temporal sulcus amygdala insula inferior parietal lobe and brodmann area 44 in addition activation change wa higher in superior temporal sulcus insula and inferior frontal gyrus for a switch from happiness to fear than for fear to happiness our result suggest an involvement of the mn in valence discrimination and a higher sensitivity of the mn to negative than positive valence these finding point to a role of the mn that go beyond the mere coding of a motor state,1.0
cognitive behavioral model of body dysmorphic disorder bdd suggest the disorder is characterized by several interpretive attentional and perceptual bias that contribute to it maintenance or even development in addition the role of aesthetic sensitivity ha been discussed in bdd however previous research examining the ability to identify subtle change in facial feature and geometrical object ha produced mixed result the purpose of the current study wa to further evaluate facial and object discrimination among individual with bdd n 35 individual with a dermatological condition n 35 and mentally healthy control participant n 35 using a facial and object discrimination paradigm assessing the sensitivity for change in symmetry color and size overall the group did not differ with respect to their performance in detecting actual change in facial or object image however there wa a significant group difference when they were presented with a series of unchanged facial but not object image the bdd group rated identical facial image significantly more often a being changed relative to individual without bdd the current result are discussed in light of the existing literature on facial and object discrimination in bdd,0.0

introduction association among sexual excitation sexual inhibition atypical sexual arousal pattern and risky sexual behavior have been reported in study involving men and woman to date longitudinal study have not evaluated the predictive value of these propensity for future sexual behavior in woman aim to investigate association among sexual excitation sexual inhibition atypical sexual arousal pattern and potentially risky sexual behavior in woman method overall 2 214 woman mean age 30 65 year standard deviation 9 91 year participated in a baseline web based survey the 1 and 2 year follow up survey included 396 and 382 participant respectively correlational analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were conducted to analyze the relation between predictor and outcome variable main outcome measure number of partner number of one time sexual encounter and number of partner with whom no condom were used during the 12 month period before each of the three data assessment point result all five lower order factor of sexual excitation showed positive correlation and all three lower order factor of sexual inhibition showed negative correlation with outcome at baseline and follow up atypical sexual arousal pattern the tendency to become aroused in unusual sexual situation and the importance of relationship factor such a trust for sexual arousal were the strongest predictor for sexual behavior at baseline these variable also predicted the number of sexual partner and the number of one night stand at follow up conclusion the finding suggest that increased sexual arousal when experiencing negative mood might be a risk factor for potentially health threatening sexual decision and support the assumption of the dual control model that sexual excitation is positively and sexual inhibition is negatively predictive of risky sexual behavior in woman,1.0
while the factor structure of post traumatic stress disorder ptsd symptom ha been investigated among various traumatized population in western and high income country knowledge regarding the validity of factor structure of ptsd among culturally diverse population in low and middle income country is limited the current study examined the factor structure and cultural invariance of ptsd in 521 iraqi and 993 syrian war affected displaced people who were living in the kurdistan region of iraq result from confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that alternative factor model for ptsd including a new model derived from this population anhedonia and affect model resulted in a better fit than the current dsm v model taken together the result showed that a good fit a well a the measurement invariance of ptsd factor could be obtained by applying the anhedonia and hybrid model this study provides further support for the anhedonia and hybrid model of ptsd and fill an important gap in knowledge about the validity of ptsd symptom cluster among arab and kurdish population,1.0
the autocorrelation or inertia of negative affect reflects how much negative emotion carry over from moment to moment and ha been associated with increased depressive symptom in this study we posed three challenge to this association by examining 1 whether emotional inertia is relevant for depressive symptom when assessed on a longer timescale than usual 2 whether inertia is uniquely related to depressive symptom after controlling for perseverative thought and 3 whether inertia is related to depressive symptom over and above the within person association between affect and perseverative thought participant n 101 provided rating of affect and perseverative thought for 100 day depressive symptom were reported before and after the study and again after 2 5 year day to day emotional inertia wa related to depressive symptom over and above trait and state perseverative thought moreover inertia predicted depressive symptom when adjusting for it association with perseverative thought these finding establish the relevance of emotional inertia in depressive symptom independent of perseverative thought,1.0
the evaluation of treatment integrity therapist adherence and competence is a necessary condition to ensure the internal and external validity of psychotherapy research however the evaluation process is associated with high cost because therapy session must be rated by experienced clinician it is debatable whether rating session segment is an adequate alternative to rating entire session four judge evaluated treatment integrity i e therapist adherence and competence in 84 randomly selected videotape of cognitive behavioral therapy for major depressive disorder social anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis from three different treatment outcome study in each case two judge provided rating based on entire therapy session and two on session segment only i e the middle third of the entire session interrater reliability of adherence and competence evaluation proved satisfactory for rating based on segment and the level of reliability did not differ from rating based on entire session rating of treatment integrity that were based on entire session and session segment were strongly correlated r 62 for adherence and r 73 for competence the relationship between treatment integrity and outcome wa comparable for rating based on session segment and those based on entire session however significant relationship between therapist competence and therapy outcome were only found in the treatment of social anxiety disorder rating based on segment proved to be adequate for the evaluation of treatment integrity the finding demonstrate that session segment are an adequate and cost effective alternative to entire session for the evaluation of therapist adherence and competence,0.0
unconscious stimulus can influence participant motor behavior but also more complex mental process recent research ha gradually extended the limit of effect of unconscious stimulus one field of research where such limit have been proposed is spatial cueing where exogenous automatic shift of attention have been distinguished from endogenous controlled process which govern voluntary shift of attention previous evidence suggests unconscious effect on mechanism of exogenous shift of attention here we applied a cue priming paradigm to a spatial cueing task with arbitrary cue by centrally presenting a masked symmetrical prime before every cue stimulus we found priming effect on response time in target discrimination task with the typical dynamic of cue priming effect experiment 1 and 2 indicating that central symmetrical stimulus which have been associated with endogenous orienting can modulate shift of spatial attention even when they are masked prime cue congruency effect of perceptual dissimilar prime and cue stimulus experiment 3 suggest that these effect cannot be entirely reduced to perceptual repetition priming of cue processing in addition priming effect did not differ between participant with good and poor prime recognition performance consistent with the view that unconscious stimulus feature have access to process of endogenous shift of attention,1.0

background emotional eating is associated with overeating and the development of obesity yet empirical evidence for individual trait difference in emotional eating and cognitive mechanism that contribute to eating during sad mood remain equivocal aim the aim of this study wa to test if attention bias for food moderate the effect of self reported emotional eating during sad mood v neutral mood on actual food intake it wa expected that emotional eating is predictive of elevated attention for food and higher food intake after an experimentally induced sad mood and that attentional maintenance on food predicts food intake during a sad versus a neutral mood method participant n 85 were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental mood induction condition sad neutral attentional bias for high caloric food were measured by eye tracking during a visual probe task with pictorial food and neutral stimulus self reported emotional eating wa assessed with the dutch eating behavior questionnaire debq and ad libitum food intake wa tested by a disguised food offer result hierarchical multivariate regression modeling showed that self reported emotional eating did not account for change in attention allocation for food or food intake in either condition yet attention maintenance on food cue wa significantly related to increased intake specifically in the neutral condition but not in the sad mood condition discussion the current finding show that self reported emotional eating based on the debq might not validly predict who overeats when sad at least not in a laboratory setting with healthy woman result further suggest that attention maintenance on food relates to eating motivation when in a neutral affective state and might therefore be a cognitive mechanism contributing to increased food intake in general but maybe not during sad mood,0.0
previous research on autonomic characteristic of social anxiety in child and adolescent ha produced highly inconsistent result which may partially be due to task difference and a limited breadth of autonomic measurement here we investigated a sample of high hsa and low socially anxious lsa child aged 10 12 year before during and after a standardized evaluated speech task while acquiring a broad set of autonomic and experiential measure during baseline we found evidence for tonically higher sympathetic autonomic activity in hsa child indicated by higher low frequency heart rate variability lf and a trend for higher lf to high frequency heart rate variability ratio lf hf in response to the speech task hsa child showed blunted cardiac responding evidenced by slower increase and delayed recovery of heart rate and a similar significant trend on lf hf value self reported anxiety by contrast showed enhanced reactivity from baseline to anticipation in the hsa compared to the lsa group the result suggest a restricted cardiac flexibility in hsa child and illustrate that broad autonomic assessment during a well structured naturalistic task may improve our understanding of the autonomic physiology of socially anxious child the result have implication for current theory of social anxiety,1.0

excessive anxiety and avoidance during provocation of body symptom are core feature of anxiety related disorder and might contribute to the development and maintenance of these disorder previous study examined psychological anxiety sensitivity fear of suffocation and trait anxiety and biobehavioral breath holding time predictor of reported anxiety during symptom provocation however the role of these predictor on avoidance of feared body symptom remains unclear therefore the present work aimed at investigating the main and interactive effect of psychological and biobehavioral variable in predicting avoidance during provocation of dyspnea that successively increased in severity 28 of 69 participant prematurely terminated the provocation sequence thus preventing further progression of symptom provocation logistic regression revealed that higher anxiety sensitivity and lower breath holding time were significantly associated with avoidance during exposure suffocation fear and trait anxiety were not related to avoidance moreover there wa a significant interaction between breath holding time and anxiety sensitivity in predicting avoidance participant with a lower breath holding time showed more avoidance behavior when reporting high a compared to low anxiety sensitivity the data suggest that anxiety sensitivity and breath holding time increase the risk to show avoidance and thus might contribute to the development and maintenance of anxiety related disorder,0.0
disgust extinction is an important mechanism relevant for the treatment of psychiatric disorder however only a few study have investigated disgust extinction moreover because disgust sensitivity d is considered a a relevant factor for learning process this study also investigated the potential relationship between d and disgust extinction learning the aim of this study wa to explore the neuronal correlate of disgust extinction a well a change in skin conductance response scrs and evaluative conditioning twenty subject were exposed to a differential extinction paradigm in which a previous conditioned and now unreinforced stimulus conditioned stimulus c wa compared to a second stimulus c which wa previously not associated with the unconditioned stimulus ucs extinction learning wa measured on three different response level bold response scrs and evaluative conditioning regarding evaluative conditioning the c wa rated a more unpleasant than the c interestingly significantly increased amygdala response and scrs toward to the c were observed finally a negative trend wa found between d score and bold response of the prefrontal cortex the present finding showed a dissociation of different response level the increased c response could be explained by the assumption that the increased amygdala activity may reflect a safety learning signal during the first extinction trial and the subjective focus may therefore shift from the c to the c the correlation finding support previous study postulating that d hamper extinction process the present result point toward dissociation between the response level in context of extinction process,1.0

introduction the aim of the present study wa to investigate the effect of mindfulness based cognitive therapy mbct on suicidal ideation in an open label randomised controlled trial of patient with residual depressive symptom furthermore this study aimed at examining whether an effect of mbct on suicidal ideation wa dependent on a reduction in depression severity worry and rumination or an increase in mindfulness method one hundred and thirty participant were randomised to a treatment arm treatment a usual plus mbct or a wait list arm change in depression change in worry change in rumination and change in mindfulness were entered a covariates in a repeated measure anova in order to ass to what degree mbct induced change in suicidal ideation were independent from change in these parameter result there wa a significant groupxtime pre v post interaction on suicidal ideation indicating a significant reduction of suicidal ideation in the mbct group but not in the control group the interaction remained significant after addition of the above covariates change in worry wa the only covariate associated with change in suicidal ideation causing a moderate reduction in the interaction effect size conclusion the result suggest that mbct may affect suicidal ideation in patient with residual depressive symptom and that this effect may be mediated in part by participant enhanced capacity to distance themselves from worrying thought,1.0
the extent of the attentional blink effect on detection rate in rapid serial visual presentation is modulated by the emotionality of the stimulus emotionally salient stimulus are detected more often even if presented in the attentional blink period and elicit an enlarged p3 response which ha been interpreted a enhanced consolidation this effect correlate with individual difference in trait affectivity such a anxiety or dysphoria here we ask if it is also related to the capacity to detect emotion in others i e to interpersonal social trait we therefore presented emotional and neutral image depicting social scene a target in an attentional blink design and measured detection rate and event related potential in addition we recorded self report of empathy a measured by the interpersonal reactivity index the result show enhanced performance for emotional stimulus and increased p3 amplitude which correlated with individual difference in empathy the data suggest that self reported empathy go along with enhanced processing of emotion in social stimulus even under stimulus condition that are suboptimal for conscious target detection,1.0
the aim of the present study wa to examine the association between self esteem motive satisfaction and body weight in acute acan and recovered recan inpatient with anorexia nervosa an and in healthy control both acan and recan showed lower level of self esteem a compared with healthy control but did not differ from each other in acan decreased body weight wa associated with increased self esteem satisfaction of an achievement motive but not satisfaction of a superiority motive mediated this association no such correlation could be observed in the other group this is the first study to show an often assumed association between decreased body weight and increased self esteem in an patient these preliminary result strengthen the assumption that low body weight may foster self esteem in patient with acan mainly through the satisfaction of an achievement motive key practitioner message self esteem should be focused very early in the treatment of an since weight gain may deprive the patient of an important source of self esteem treatment intervention should be attuned to underlying motif of threatened self esteem in an patient the enhancement of self esteem via weight loss seems to be rather fuelled by the satisfaction of an achievement motive than by the satisfaction of a superiority motive specific training to improve self esteem in an patient seem to be promising a an add on to regular treatment,0.0
emotion can modulate the encoding and recollection of personal event in the present study we investigated the effect of different emotional state pleasant neutral or anxious on episodic memory formation in a virtual reality vr setting emotional state were induced by pleasant neutral or anxiety inducing movie clip prior to the presentation of specific event in a vr scenario episodic memory performance of healthy participant in whom an anxious emotional state had been induced wa inferior to those of the neutral and pleasant condition in the anxious condition participant were particularly impaired regarding their memory for the location of event a correlational analysis indicated that high level of negative arousal were associated with poor memory for the temporal and spatial context of event in contrast high level of happiness were associated with better memory for the spatial context of event our data provide evidence that emotional arousal can modulate memory for what happened where and when,1.0

abstract social anxiety disorder sad and more generally social fear are common in young people although avoidance behavior are known to be an important maintaining factor of social anxiety little is known about the severity and occurrence of avoidance behavior in young people from the general population hampering approach for early identification and intervention symptom syndrome and diagnosis of dsm 5 mental disorder including sad were assessed in a random population based sample of 14 21 year old n 1 180 from dresden germany in 2015 2016 using a standardized diagnostic interview dia x 5 d cidi an adapted version of the liebowitz social anxiety scale wa used to ascertain the extent of social fear and avoidance diagnostic criterion for lifetime sad were met by n 82 participant resulting in a weighted lifetime prevalence of 6 6 social anxiety wa predominantly reported for test situation and when speaking or performing in front of others avoidance wa most prevalent in the latter situation on average anxiety and avoidance first occurred at age 11 and 12 respectively with avoidance occurring in most case either at about the same age a anxiety or slightly later in the total sample lifetime prevalence for most dsm 5 disorder increased with the severity of social anxiety and avoidance result underline the need for preventive or early intervention effort especially regarding test anxiety and fear and avoidance of speaking in front of others these situation are particularly relevant in youth avoidance behavior may also be discussed a diagnostic marker for early case identification,1.0
background childhood adversity especially emotional abuse emotional neglect and peer victimization are considered to be crucial risk factor for social anxiety disorder sad we investigated whether particular form of retrospectively recalled childhood adversity are specifically associated with sad in adulthood or whether we find similar link in other anxiety or depressive disorder method prevalence of adversity assessed with the childhood trauma questionnaire ctq and a questionnaire of stressful social experience fbs were determined in n 1091 outpatient adversity severity among patient with sad only n 25 specific phobia only n 18 and generalized anxiety disorder only n 19 were compared difference between patient with anxiety disorder only n 62 and depressive disorder only n 239 a well a between sad with comorbid depressive disorder n 143 and sad only were tested result none of the adversity type were found to be specifically associated with sad and severity did not differ among anxiety disorder but patient with depressive disorder reported more severe emotional abuse physical abuse and sexual abuse than patient with anxiety disorder sad patient with a comorbid depressive disorder also reported more severe adversity across all type compared to sad only conclusion finding indicate that particular form of recalled childhood adversity are not specifically associated with sad in adulthood previously established link with sad may be better explained by comorbid depressive symptom,0.0
the co occurrence of depression and envy is both plausible and empirically established however little is known about the mechanism underlying this correlation an account is proposed according to which low self esteem in depressed individual lead to upward social comparison and thus make envy more likely this effect should frequently occur in online social network like facebook because they allow for easy impression management and hence provide high comparison standard in a quasi experimental online study depressed and nondepressed participant indicated their self esteem and were then presented with specifically set up facebook profile that were either attractive or unattractive participant were asked to compare themselves to the profile owner and to report their resulting feeling of inferiority and envy depressed participant were more envious especially after seeing the attractive profile envy wa associated with higher self reported inferiority and also correlated negatively with self esteem the connection between depression and envy is demonstrated with an experimental elicitation of envy for the first time the result strongly suggest that low self esteem and consequent feeling of inferiority play a crucial role in depressed individual elevated level of envy practical implication and limitation are discussed,1.0
this study investigates enhanced visuomotor processing of phobic compared to fear relevant and neutral stimulus we used a response priming design to measure rapid automatic motor activation by natural image spider snake mushroom and flower in spider fearful snake fearful and control participant we found strong priming effect in all task and condition however result showed marked difference between group most importantly in the group of spider fearful individual spider picture had a strong and specific influence on even the fastest motor response phobic prime entailed the largest priming effect and phobic target accelerated response both effect indicating speeded response activation by phobic image in snake fearful participant this processing enhancement for phobic material wa le pronounced and extended to both snake and spider image we conclude that spider phobia lead to enhanced processing capacity for phobic image we argue that this is enabled by long term perceptual learning process,1.0
background exposure and response prevention is effective and recommended a the first choice for treating obsessive compulsive disorder ocd it mechanism of action are rarely studied but two major theory make distinct assumption while the emotional processing theory assumes that treatment effect are associated with habituation within and between exposure session the inhibitory learning approach highlight the acquisition of additional association implying alternative mechanism like expectancy violation the present study aimed to investigate whether process variable derived from both theory predict short term outcome method in a university outpatient unit 110 patient 63 female with ocd received manual based cognitive behavioral therapy with high standardization of the first two exposure session specifically therapist repeated the first exposure session identically and assessed subjective unit of distress a well a expectancy rating in the course of exposure session based on these data individual score for habituation and distress related expectancy violation were calculated and used for prediction of both percentage change on the yale brown obsessive compulsive scale y bocs and remission status after 20 therapy session result in a multiple regression model for percentage change within session habituation during the first exposure wa a significant predictor while in a logistic regression predicting remission status distress related expectancy violation during the first exposure revealed significance a path model further supported these finding conclusion the result represent first evidence for distress related expectancy violation and confirm preliminary finding for habituation suggesting that both process contribute to treatment benefit of exposure in ocd and both mechanism appear to be independent,1.0
overeating episode despite of intention to control weight are a common problem among woman recurring episode of overeating and dietary failure have been reported to result in higher body mass index and to induce severe distress even in non clinical group based on finding from physiological research on eating behavior and craving a well a previous biofeedback study we derived a cue exposure based eeg neurofeedback protocol to target overeating episode the treatment wa evaluated in a randomized controlled trial comparing a neurofeedback group nfg n 14 with a waiting list control group wlg n 13 in a sub clinical sample of female restrained eater at post treatment the number of weekly overeating episode and subsequent distress were significantly reduced in the nfg compared to the wlg p 01 r 50 in a 3 month follow up effect in the nfg remained stable a secondary outcome perceived dieting success wa enhanced after the treatment at follow up additional beneficial effect on trait food craving were observed altogether we found preliminary evidence for the cue exposure neurofeedback against overeating episode in female restrained eater although specific effect and underlying mechanism still have to be explored in future research,1.0
this study investigates the proposition that micro level experience in the realm of stress e g daily stress exposure are among the building block of maladjustment in particular depression data were collected with experience sampling method and in the lab a sample of 202 student who had just entered university participated in a three wave longitudinal study october 2012 october 2013 each wave consisted of the assessment of depressive symptom and the examination of stressful experience in daily life by mean of experience sampling 70 occasion per wave cross lagged panel model revealed that the perceived intensity of daily stressor stressed and depressed feeling in daily life a well a depressed reaction to daily stressor predict an increase in future depressive symptom in young female but not male other cross lagged effect particularly from depressive symptom to stressful experience in daily life were not significant finding are in line with the stress exposure model,0.0
background the perceived stress scale cohen j health soc behav 24 385 96 1983 is a widely and well established self report scale measuring perceived stress however the german version of the ps 10 ha not yet been validated thus the purpose of this representative study were to psychometrically evaluate the ps 10 and to provide norm value for the german population method the ps 10 and standardized scale of depression anxiety fatigue procrastination and life satisfaction were administered to a representative randomly selected german community sample consisting of 1315 female and 1148 male participant in the age range from 14 to 90 year result the result demonstrated a good internal consistency and construct validity perceived stress wa consistently associated with depression anxiety fatigue procrastination and reduced life satisfaction confirmatory factor analysis revealed a bi dimensional structure with two related latent factor regarding demographic variable woman reported a higher level of stress than men perceived stress decreased with higher education income and employment status older and married participant felt le stressed than younger and unmarried participant conclusion the ps 10 is a reliable valid and economic instrument for assessing perceived stress a psychological stress is associated with an increased risk of disease identifying subpopulation with higher level of stress is essential due to the dependency of the perceived stress level on demographic variable particularly age and sex differentiated norm value are needed which are provided in this paper,1.0
avoidance is a transdiagnostic symptom of clinical anxiety and it reduction a major focus of cognitive behavioral treatment this study examined the instrumental extinction of goal directed avoidance by mean of incentive verbal instruction and social observation and their influence on fear extinction participant acquired conditioned fear and instrumental avoidance response n 160 in four randomized group the reduction of avoidance by incentive for non avoidance instruction to refrain from avoidance and social observation of non avoidance wa compared to no intervention before removing the aversive outcome conditioned fear when avoidance became unavailable subsequently wa tested incentive instruction and observation all reduced avoidance better than no intervention however with different degree and influence on conditioned fear incentive and instruction strongly reduced avoidance despite high level of fear i e fear opposite action this initiated fear extinction thereby reducing conditioned fear when avoidance became unavailable social observation directly reduced conditioned fear presumably because it conveyed additional information about the absence of the aversive outcome however observation only moderately reduced avoidance and resulted in higher fear when avoidance became unavailable the effect of social observation may depend on the nuance of the demonstrator s behavior the clear effect of incentive and instruction provide support for clinical intervention to reduce avoidance during exposure therapy and can serve a experimental model for their controlled investigation,1.0
child maltreatment is known to engender negative emotional and behavioral consequence although neglect is the most frequent form of maltreatment it ha thus far only received little attention especially when looking at low resource country the current study investigated possible association between neglect and internalizing and externalizing problem a neglect and abuse often co occur the latter wa controlled for in total 409 tanzanian primary school student 52 boy m 10 5 year range 6 15 participated in the cross sectional study structured clinical interview were conducted assessing maltreatment internalizing problem and externalizing problem overall 31 n 128 of the child reported at least one type of physical neglect and 31 n 127 of emotional neglect using structural equation modeling we found a significant association between neglect and internalizing beta 0 59 p lt 01 and externalizing problem beta 0 35 p lt 05 however these association could only be detected in younger child age 6 9 whereas in older child age 10 15 mental health problem were significantly related to violence and abuse our finding suggest that the current age may influence the association between maltreatment type and the development of internalizing and or externalizing problem,0.0
aim patient reported outcome such a health related quality of life hrqol are main treatment goal for heart failure hf and therefore endpoint in multinational therapy trial however little is known about country specific difference in hrqol and in treatment associated hrqol improvement the present work sought to examine those question method and result we analysed data from the cardiac insufficiency bisoprolol study in elderly cibis eld trial in which patient from central and south eastern europe completed the hrqol questionnaire sf 36 at baseline and the end of a 12 week beta blocker up titration follow up 416 patient from serbia mean age 72 21 year 69 nyha class i ii 27 4 woman and 114 from germany mean age 73 64 year 78 9 nyha class i ii 47 4 woman were included controlling for clinical variable the change in mental hrqol from baseline to follow up wa modulated by country serbian patient m baseline 37 85 v m follow up 40 99 t 526 5 34 p 001 reported a stronger increase than german m baseline 37 66 v m follow up 38 23 t 526 0 68 n for physical hrqol we observed a main effect of country m serbia 39 28 v m germany 35 29 t 526 4 24 p 001 conclusion we observed significant difference in hf patient from germany and serbia and country specific difference between serbian and german patient in mean physical hrqol change in mental hrqol were modulated by country those result may reflect psychological sociocultural aetiological difference or regional difference in phenotype prevalence more importantly they suggest that future multinational trial should consider such aspect when designing a trial in order to avoid uncertainty aligned to data interpretation and to improve subsequent treatment optimisation,1.0
both cognitive stressor such a mental arithmetic task and physical stressor such a the cold pressor test cp are among the most widely employed tool in acute stress research and there is growing evidence for a high degree of stimulus response specificity rather than uniformity in the human stress response however little is known about potential synergistic or interfering effect during concurrent administration while cognitive task have been hypothesized to attenuate pain perception during cp they are also thought to enhance physiological reactivity conversely physical stress might interfere with effective stress induction by cognitive challenge to address these question 56 participant underwent either the cp 3 min ice water immersion of foot or a warm water control condition in half of the sample the paced auditory serial addition task pasat wa performed simultaneously fully crossed intervention salivary cortisol cardiovascular parameter and subjective rating a well a voice pitch f0 were assessed result show that cortisol response self reported pain and subjective arousal were mainly driven by cold exposure which also led to increased f0 the pasat incrementally enhanced cardiovascular reaction but did not affect pain rating nor cortisol response to the cp however intra individual concordance between elevated blood pressure and other reactivity measure wa enhanced by pasat administration during the cp importantly performance decrement in the mental arithmetic task were not associated with diminished stress response in conclusion our result speak against any strong interference when administering cognitive and painful physical stressor simultaneously pointing rather to specific additive effect particularly regarding cardiovascular reactivity,0.0
background functional gastrointestinal disorder fgid are defined by a combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptom prevalence rate of fgid are high symptom are associated with distress and sufferer show high stress level however the current diagnostic criterion do not consider subjective distress elicited by the symptom thus potentially leading to overestimated prevalence rate the aim of this study wa to explore the reduction in prevalence rate when distress is considered in the diagnostic criterion method in this web based study fgid were diagnosed using the rome ii criterion prevalence rate with and without subjective distress elicited by the symptom were computed additionally stress level and stress reactivity were assessed result prevalence rate of fgid in our sample were similar to those in other study however when considering the distress criterion on average a decrease of 38 51 wa found in the prevalence rate of fgid sufferer who were subjectively distressed by their symptom reported significantly higher stress level than non distressed subject all p 0 001 conclusion the consideration of a criterion of subjective distress in the diagnosis of fgid ha consequence for actual prevalence rate of fgid distressed subject differ markedly from non distressed subject in term of their stress level the inclusion of a distress criterion in the ongoing development of diagnostic criterion for fgid is therefore warranted,1.0

objective the hedonic value of odor is reflected in chemosensory evoked potential with more salient unpleasant odor being processed differently from pleasant odor however it is not known if this effect is stable over time it wa examined if chemosensory evoked potential towards pleasant and unpleasant odor change with repeated presentation method 42 participant received two pleasant peach and pea and one unpleasant h2s intensity matched odor in a block design intensity and pleasantness were rated after each presentation subjective rating a well a n1 and p2 of the first stimulus of each block were compared with the two following stimulus of each block result early and late component of the chemosensory evoked potential had shorter latency in response to the unpleasant h2s compared to pea and peach pleasantness rating for h2s increased with repeated presentation but were far below neutral even for the third stimulus in a row in line with this for h2s only the p2 amplitude diminished with repeated presentation conclusion we assume that unpleasant stimulus catch more attention first hand however repeated presentation lead to reduced emotional salience of unpleasant stimulus only which is mirrored in a decrease of neuronal activation,1.0
background altered ventral striatal vst activation to reward expectancy is a well established intermediate phenotype for psychiatric disorder specifically schizophrenia sz preclinical research suggests that striatal alteration are related to a reduced inhibition by the hippocampal formation but it role in human transdiagnostic reward network dysfunction is not well understood method we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging during reward processing in 728 individual including healthy control subject n 396 patient sz n 46 bipolar disorder n 45 major depressive disorder n 60 and unaffected first degree relative sz n 46 bipolar disorder n 50 major depressive disorder n 85 we assessed disorder specific difference in functional vst hippocampus coupling and transdiagnostic association with dimensional measure of positive negative and cognitive symptom we also probed the genetic underpinning using polygenic risk score for sz in a subset of healthy participant n 295 result functional vst hippocampus coupling wa 1 reduced in patient with sz and bipolar disorder p fwe 05 small volume corrected svc 2 associated transdiagnostically to dimensional measure of positive p fwe 01 svc and cognitive p fwe 02 svc but not negative p fwe 05 svc symptom and 3 reduced in first degree relative of patient with sz p fwe 017 svc and linked to the genetic risk for sz in healthy participant p 035 conclusion we provide evidence that reduced vst hippocampus coupling during reward processing is an endophenotype for sz linked to positive and cognitive symptom supporting current preclinical model of the emergence of psychosis moreover our data indicate that vst hippocampus coupling is familial and linked to polygenic score for sz supporting the use of this measure a an intermediate phenotype for psychotic disorder,0.0
nightmare are a well known phenomenon the content of aversive dream seems to be ubiquitous in dream nevertheless a dream containing aversive content doe not necessarily have to be a nightmare we hypothesize that nightmare are rather caused by a more negative appraisal of the content of aversive dream than by the dream content itself to investigate this question n 99 participant kept dream diary over 28 consecutive day an experimental group included person with frequent nightmare and a control group of person without nightmare violent dream content and emotion during the dream were analyzed by the dreamer themselves and a well a by four external raters regarding violent dream content in non nightmare dream report the external raters usually agreed with the dreamer rating however there wa significant disagreement regarding the nightmare report furthermore external raters significantly rated the dream a le positive than the dreamer did and external raters rated the nightmare report a more negative than the dreamer themselves did taken together the result support the hypothesis that the classification of a dream a a nightmare doe not only depend on it content but also on other factor this suggests that the dreamer rating of a dream a a nightmare are based on more factor than dream content gender difference in dream content have been studied quite extensively the present study focused on two dream characteristic the ratio of male and female dream character and the occurrence of weapon and clothes in dream a sample of 1612 diary dream reported by 425 participant wa analyzed using external rating by a blind judge whereas the gender difference regarding the ratio of male and female dream character wa not significant men reported more weapon dream but dream with reference to clothing le often which is in line with previous research the explorative analysis indicated that some of the big five personality dimension might be associated with these dream characteristic e g extraverted men s dream included more female character compared to the dream of introverted men research thus far and this study indicate that waking life preoccupation with clothes medium showing weapon waking life social contact etc strongly affect these dream characteristic but study explicitly measuring and correlating waking life experience and dream content are still missing according to the threat simulation theory tst dreaming ha developed and wa maintained during evolution because it function of rehearsing threat is essential for survival the present study analyzed 1612 diary dream reported by 425 participant mainly psychology student the study result indicate that threat play an important role in dream and thus support the idea that dreaming might have a function of rehearsing problematic or threatening situation comparing the present result to previous finding show a considerably large variability regarding the number of threat per dream the proportion of minor threat and the reality of threat a neuroticism and openness to experience were related to the number of threat per dream future research should investigate inter individual difference in waking life which might help explain the variability regarding the dream threat characteristic,0.0
several study have linked the covid 19 pandemic to unfavorable mental health outcome however we know little about long term change in mental health due to the pandemic so far here we used longitudinal data from a general population sample of 1388 adult from germany who were initially assessed between april and may 2020 i e at the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic in germany and prospectively followed up after 6 n 1082 and 12 month n 945 depressive and anxiety symptom a well a loneliness did not change from baseline to 6 month follow up while anxiety symptom did not change in the long run depressive symptom and loneliness increased and life satisfaction decreased from baseline to 12 month follow up moreover vulnerable group such a younger individual or those with a history of mental disorder exhibited an overall higher level of psychopathological symptom across all assessment wave our finding suggest a deterioration in mental health during the course of the covid 19 pandemic which emphasizes the importance to implement targeted health promotion to prevent a further symptom escalation especially in vulnerable group,0.0

emergency medical service em personnel frequently encounter emotionally stressful or even traumatic incident in their line of duty in this study a checklist of emotionally stressful event for the german em wa introduced a mixed method approach wa used to identify mission event that were critical for the development of mental and physical stress symptom data were collected in a cross sectional sample of 102 em employee a quantitative content analysis of the participant worst experience on duty indicated traumatic mission to be a concatenation of two to five emotionally stressful event rescue mission were experienced a traumatic if i em personnel became victim of attack or threat ii certain circumstance caused them to give up their professional detachment from patient iii em personnel perceived the overall mission a exceptionally tragic in subsequent correlation analysis the corresponding checklist item showed consistent positive association with the post traumatic depressive and physical stress symptom among the study cohort within the exploratory regression the sum score of critical on duty exposure contributed incrementally to the prediction of mental and physical stress symptom when non work related trauma exposure and perceived social support were also considered finding point toward the importance of considering the cumulative burden of critical incident for the long term health of em personnel future research is needed to investigate how on duty trauma affect the social support em personnel received from their work and personal relationship,1.0
background across psychopathology trauma exposed individual suffer from difficulty in inhibiting emotion and regulating attention in trauma exposed individual without psychopathology only subtle alteration of neural activity involved in regulating emotion have been reported it remains unclear how these neural system react to demanding environment when acute non traumatic but ordinary stress serf to perturbate the system moreover association with subthreshold clinical symptom are poorly understood method the present fmri study investigated response inhibition of emotional face before and after psychosocial stress situation specifically it compared 25 woman mean age 31 5 9 7 year who had suffered severe early life trauma but who did not have a history of or current psychiatric disorder with 25 age and education matched trauma naive woman result under stress response inhibition related to fearful face wa reduced in both group compared to control trauma exposed woman showed decreased left inferior frontal gyrus ifg activation under stress when inhibiting response to fearful face while activation of the right anterior insula wa slightly increased also group differed in brain behaviour correlation whereas stress induced false alarm rate on fearful stimulus negatively correlated with stress induced ifg signal in control in trauma exposed participant they positively correlated with stress induced insula activation conclusion neural facilitation of emotion inhibition during stress appears to be altered in trauma exposed woman even without a history of or current psychopathology decreased activation of the ifg in concert with heightened bottom up salience of fear related cue may increase vulnerability to stress related disease,1.0
the peak end memory bias ha been well documented for the retrospective evaluation of pain it describes that the retrospective evaluation of pain is largely based on the discomfort experienced at the most intense point peak and at the end of the episode this is notable because it mean that longer episode with a better ending can be remembered a le aversive than shorter one this is even if the former had the same peak in painfulness and an overall longer duration of pain until now this bias ha not been studied in the domain of anxiety despite the high relevance of variable level of anxiety in the treatment of anxiety disorder therefore we set out to replicate the original study but with an induction of variable level of anxiety of 64 woman half watched a clip from a horror movie which ended at the most frightening moment the other half watched an extended version of this clip with a moderately frightening ending afterward all participant were asked to rate the global anxiety which wa elicited by the video when the film ended at the most frightening moment participant retrospectively reported more anxiety than participant who watched the extended version this is the first study to document that the peak end bias can be found in the domain of anxiety these finding require replication and extension to a treatment context to evaluate it implication for exposure therapy,1.0
physiological stress response vary a a function of adverse childhood experience however previous study concentrate on familial source of childhood adversity potential long term effect of peer victimization on physiology and affective response are le known this study examined cardiac facial muscular and experiential response to social evaluative stimulus in ninety four healthy subject with various degree of experienced peer victimization in a social conditioning task peer victimization wa associated with similarly attenuated cardiac and facial muscular response to negative and neutral stimulus while differentiated physiological response to negative and neutral stimulus were found in subject without peer victimization overall increased rating of arousal valence and disapproval for negative compared to neutral stimulus were found contrary to the physiological response peer victimization wa associated with more negative rating of negative stimulus one month after acquisition the result suggest that the physiological and experiential reactivity towards both negative and neutral social stimulus is affected by the experience of peer victimization peer victimization cause generalized autonomic dysregulation and memory recall bias during social learning impeding adequate response preparation to social stressor,1.0
objective physical activity and healthy eating seem to be protective against experiencing stress and negative affect a well a increase positive affect at the same time previous study showed that people reduce salutogenic behaviour such a physical activity and healthy eating in the face of stress and negative affect while increasing such behaviour in the context of positive affect due to daily fluctuation of these behaviour the present study examined these relationship in daily life using ecological momentary assessment ema design and method fifty one university student responded to six daily prompt during 7 day via smartphone based ema item examined stress emotional experience physical activity duration and healthy eating result higher stress and negative affect a well a lower positive affect were related to a reduction in subsequent physical activity higher physical activity level in turn were associated with le subsequent stress and negative affect a well a more positive affect no such effect for stress and affect on healthy eating or vice versa were found conclusion engaging in physical activity is related to better mood and le stress negative affect over the next several hour in daily life prevention effort therefore may benefit by focusing on promoting physical activity particularly when stress negative affect is high to break the cycle of inactivity stress and negative affect potential effect of healthy eating might be more subtle and characterized by interindividual difference or state effect statement of contribution what is already known on this subject physical activity can reduce stress a well a negative emotion and can enhance positive emotion people tend to eat le healthy food during stressful time and healthy eating can increase general health physical activity and healthy eating have been mostly assessed separately and through retrospective method what doe this study add this is an ema study investigating bidirectional effect of stress emotion and salutogenic behaviour after physical activity people felt le stressed negative and more positive feeling better and le stressed resulted in more physical activity healthy eating wa not associated with stress or emotion level and vice versa,0.0
background selective mutism sm ha been conceptualized a an extreme variant of social anxiety disorder sad in which the failure to speak function a an avoidance mechanism leading to a reduction of intense fear arousal however psychophysiological study in child with sm are scarce and physiological mechanism underlying the failure to speak are largely unknown in contrast child with sad are characterized by a combination of a chronically elevated physiological arousal and a blunted physiological fear response to social stress due to the large overlap between sm and sad similar mechanism might apply to both disorder while difference might explain why child with sm fail to speak the aim of our study is to investigate psychophysiological mechanism of the failure to speak in child with sm method we assessed in a total of n 96 child 8 12 year sm n 31 sad n 32 typical development td n 33 resting baseline arousal in absence of social threat and the course of physiological fear response in two social stress paradigm differing in term of whether the child are expected to speak verbal task or not nonverbal task result child with sm were characterized by increased tonic arousal compared to the other two group and by a more inflexible stress response in the nonverbal but not in the verbal task compared to td child further analysis revealed that child with sm who did not speak during the verbal task already demonstrated reduced arousal in anticipation of the verbal task conclusion the increased tonic arousal generalized to non social situation in sm could indicate a long term alteration of the autonomic nervous system furthermore the differential physiological stress response may indicate that silence act a a maladaptive compensatory mechanism reducing stress in verbal social situation which doe not function in nonverbal situation our finding support the idea that the failure to speak might function a an avoidance mechanism which is already active in anticipation of a verbal situation treatment of sm should take into account that child with sm may suffer from chronically elevated stress level and that different mechanism might operate in verbal and nonverbal social situation,0.0
background and objective disturbed body perception is a common characteristic of patient with posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd after childhood sexual abuse csa we examined the extent to which biased information processing of body related stimulus wa related to csa method patient with ptsd after csa ptsd group n 61 were compared to healthy control hc group n 30 the ptsd group wa subdivided into patient with comorbid borderline personality disorder bpd ptsd group and patient without bpd ptsd group we used an emotional stroop task est with body related word to ass biased information processing result only patient in the ptsd group but not in the ptsd group showed a significantly stronger attentional bias to body related word compared to the hc group p 009 limitation recruitment in in patient setting might have led to a non representative sample of ptsd patient the ptsd patient were not characterized regarding anything other than the mentioned mental disorder potentially the body related word may have been associated with offender body area but not with the patient conclusion we found that patient with ptsd and comorbid bpd had a stronger attentional bias towards body related stimulus in comparison to other group this suggests that the observed attentional bias is a product of csa combined with the emotion regulation difficulty characteristic of bpd future study should test whether directly targeting body related abnormality in information processing can improve existing treatment for patient with csa and bpd,0.0

context although exposure to supraphysiological level of glucocorticoid is known to contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome mets the importance of physiological variation in basal cortisol secretion is le clear this issue can be addressed by using hair cortisol analysis which for the first time allows the assessment of long term integrated hormone level objective and design we used the analysis of cortisol in hair hairf to examine association of long term cortisol level with prevalence of mets and individual cardiometabolic parameter in a large occupational cohort in additional exploratory analysis we also studied cardiometabolic association with hair cortisone level participant participant included 1258 employee of a large aerospace company aged 16 64 year 84 8 male who partook in a voluntary health assessment main outcome measure the first 3 cm of scalp near hair were analyzed for glucocorticoid concentration using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry relevant cardiometabolic risk factor were assessed and mets wa diagnosed according to 2009 international task force criterion result a higher prevalence of mets wa seen in individual falling into the third odds ratio 1 71 95 confidence interval 1 08 2 69 or fourth hairf quartile odds ratio 2 42 95 confidence interval 1 55 3 75 compared with the first quartile in fully adjusted analysis hairf also showed positive association with weight related anthropometric measure body mass index waist to hip ratio waist circumference and glycated hemoglobin the exploratory analysis of hair cortisone also indicated relevant association with cardiometabolic parameter conclusion normal physiological difference in long term cortisol secretion a assessed in hair show relevant relationship with mets and individual cardiometabolic parameter,1.0
objective overactive performance monitoring a measured by the error related negativity in the event related brain potential represents one of the most robust psychophysiological alteration in obsessive compulsive disorder ocd it ha been proposed a an endophenotype for ocd because it is heritable and more prevalent in family of ocd patient consistent with this notion it is also independent of symptom profile and symptom severity in cross sectional study longitudinally it ha been shown to be state independent in pediatric patient with ocd the purpose of the present study wa to investigate the state dependency of error monitoring by examining adult ocd patient before and after symptom reduction through cognitive behavioral therapy cbt method error related and correct related negativity a electrophysiological indicator of performance monitoring were recorded from 45 ocd patient and 39 healthy comparison subject while performing a flanker task patient were assessed before starting and after completing a standard 30 session cbt including exposure and response prevention and healthy comparison subject were tested after a comparable time interval result pretreatment patient with ocd were characterized by enhanced error related and correct related negativity compared with healthy comparison subject this difference persisted after treatment when symptom were substantially reduced there wa no significant correlation between symptom improvement and change in performance monitoring and no difference in performance monitoring between treatment responder and nonresponders conclusion this is the first longitudinal study in adult ocd patient showing stability of enhanced error monitoring following successful symptom reduction through cbt it support the hypothesis that overactive performance monitoring is an endophenotype that indicates vulnerability for ocd,0.0
numerous study have identified attentional bias and processing enhancement for fear relevant stimulus in individual with specific phobia however this ha not been conclusively shown in blood injury injection bii phobia which ha rarely been investigated even though it ha feature distinct from all other specific phobia the present study aim to fill that gap and compare the time course of visuomotor processing of phobic stimulus i e picture of small injury in bii fearful n 19 and non anxious control participant n 23 by using a response priming paradigm in bii fearful participant phobic stimulus produced larger priming effect and lower response time compared to neutral stimulus whereas non anxious control participant showed no such difference because these effect are fully present in the fastest response they indicate an enhancement in early visuomotor processing of injury picture in bii fearful participant these result are comparable to the enhanced processing of phobic stimulus in other specific phobia i e spider phobia,1.0
according to the incentive motivation model sexual desire doe not occur spontaneously but can be triggered by sexual stimulus and stem from one s experience of sexual arousal until now research into responsive sexual desire ha been challenged by the lack of measure capturing desire that emerges following sexual arousal the aim of this study wa to validate the 18 item report of behavior and feeling desire rbf d scale in a sample of 291 woman m age 22 41 sd 5 82 with varying degree of sexual desire item on the rbf d were selected to reflect 5 aspect of responsive sexual desire sexual activity with a primary partner sexual desire for a primary partner sexual activity with other person sexual desire for other person and autoerotic activity a 5 factor solution wa confirmed via exploratory structural equation modeling internal consistency of 4 out of 5 factor wa good convergent validity wa established via small to medium association of the rbf d factor with other measure of sexual desire low and nonsignificant correlation with depression and sexual inhibition supported the discriminant validity the rbf d is a valid and reliable measure that can be useful in clinical and research setting where assessment of responsive sexual desire and behavior is needed,1.0
research suggests that trauma is associated with the development of psychotic experience such a paranoia via affective process however the empirical evidence on the exact mechanism is limited and it is unclear which aspect of trauma are relevant here we tested whether self reported frequency of trauma recurring trauma age and type of trauma are predictive of later threat belief in daily life and which role affective process self reported negative affect and autonomic arousal play in this association we tested two often postulated mechanism mediation with affective process in everyday life explaining the association between trauma and threat belief and moderation with trauma strengthening the association between affective process and threat belief in everyday life trauma wa assessed at baseline with the trauma history questionnaire in 67 individual with attenuated symptom of psychosis we then applied the experience sampling method during 24 h to ass negative affect heart rate and threat belief multilevel analysis showed that negative affect p 0 001 and heart rate p 0 05 were predictive of subsequent threat belief there wa no significant mediation effect from any trauma characteristic to threat belief via negative affect and heart rate trauma frequency p 0 001 age at first trauma p 0 001 a well a the presence of physical trauma p 0 001 moderated the path from negative affect to subsequent threat belief our finding indicate that more frequent trauma trauma at young age and physical trauma strengthen the association from negative affect to threat belief and could be relevant to determining the extent of vulnerability to psychosis,0.0
negative outcome expectation of psychological treatment predict unfavorable treatment outcome therefore therapist should approach negative outcome expectation and ideally transform them into more positive outcome expectation in this study we investigated the therapist s interpersonal behavior to optimize the modification of negative outcome expectation after inducing negative expectation in an online experiment we presented different video of therapist patient interaction to violate the induced negative outcome expectation we kept the expectation violating information constant and manipulated the therapist s warmth and competence result confirmed a significant influence of the therapist s warmth and competence on expectation violation which led to the most positive outcome expectation when the therapist wa both warm and competent in contrast to former correlational analysis our experimental study confirms the causal role of the therapist s interpersonal behavior and it impact on changing patient negative outcome expectation on the basis of these finding more powerful approach to optimize critical outcome expectation can be developed,1.0
study suggest that frontal alpha asymmetry is closely linked to psychological adjustment following stressful experience such that more left sided frontal activation during symptom provocation might predict lower level of posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd here we tested whether frontal asymmetry at rest and during exposure to neutral positive negative and trauma related image would be associated with ptsd and particularly with characteristic reexperiencing symptom symptom were assessed in trauma victim with n 24 and without ptsd n 15 using both retrospective measure and 1 week ambulatory assessment with a diary and a smartphone while resting frontal asymmetry wa unrelated to all retrospective measure left sided activation in response to the negative picture correlated with lower level of psychopathology left sided activation in the trauma related picture condition wa more specifically associated with le emotionally intense intrusion and response to viewing the picture even when corrected for other symptom of psychopathology these effect tended to increase when participant with possible overreporting tendency were removed from the analysis moreover trauma victim without ptsd i e relatively more resilient individual displayed higher left sided frontal activation in response to the negative picture also when compared with a third group of healthy trauma free individual n 15 our finding suggest that state dependent change in frontal asymmetry could serve a a biological marker of ptsd symptom and could eventually be used for diagnostic purpose or a a target for neuromodulation intervention future study should establish whether this marker can serve a an early predictor of psychopathology in recently traumatized individual,1.0

subjective chronic tinnitus is a condition that is common in most population whereas many individual tend to habituate to tinnitus over time for some their attention seems pathologically drawn towards the sensation for this subgroup of individual with severe tinnitus dysfunctional executive attention ha been suggested to be implicated in the failure to habituate however since most previous study have used attention test with low validity and specificity in this assessment there is a need for further corroborating study in the present study the attention network test wa used to compare mainly the efficiency of executive attention between a group of individual with chronic tinnitus tg n 33 and a healthy control group cg n 37 the result showed that individual with chronic tinnitus compared to the cg did not present with a specific impairment in executive control of attention nor in any of the other two attention domain these finding are discussed in relation to the sampling characteristic in this study which might have led to the sample being more homogenous and high functioning than sample in tinnitus study generally overall this study suggests that tinnitus and executive control of attention impairment might not be directly related and that the latter might not necessarily be associated with the maintenance of the condition,0.0
background pathological avoidance is a transdiagnostic characteristic of anxiety disorder avoidance conditioning re emerged a a translational model to examine mechanism and treatment of avoidance however it validity for anxiety disorder remains unclear method this study tested for altered avoidance in patient with anxiety disorder compared to matched control n 40 group using instrumental conditioning assessing low cost avoidance avoiding a single aversive outcome and costly avoidance avoidance conflicted with gaining reward autonomic arousal and threat expectancy were assessed a indicator of conditioned fear association with dimensional symptom severity were examined result patient and control showed frequent low cost avoidance without group difference control subsequently inhibited avoidance to gain reward which wa amplified when aversive outcome discontinued in contrast patient failed to reduce avoidance when aversive and positive outcome competed elevated costly avoidance and showed limited reduction when aversive outcome discontinued persistent costly avoidance interestingly elevated costly avoidance wa not linked to higher conditioned fear in patient moreover individual data revealed a bimodal distribution of costly avoidance some patient showed persistent avoidance others showed little to no avoidance persistent versus low avoiders did not differ in other task related variable response to gain and loss in absence of threat sociodemographic data or clinical characteristic conclusion finding suggest that anxious psychopathology is associated with a deficit to inhibit avoidance in presence of competing positive outcome this offer novel perspective for research on mechanism and treatment of anxiety disorder,0.0

sensory processing and attention allocation are shaped by threat but the role of trait anxiety in sensory processing a a function of threat predictability remains incompletely understood therefore we measured steady state visual evoked potential ssveps a an index of sensory processing of predictable and unpredictable threat cue in 29 low la and 29 high ha trait anxious participant during a modified npu paradigm followed by an extinction phase three different contextual cue indicated safety n predictable p or unpredictable threat u while foreground cue signalled shock in the p condition only all participant allocated increased attentional resource to the central p threat cue replicating previous finding importantly la individual exhibited larger ssvep amplitude to contextual threat u and p than to contextual safety cue while ha individual did not differentiate among contextual cue in general further ha exhibited higher aversive rating of all context compared to la these result suggest that high trait anxious individual might be worse at discriminating contextual threat stimulus and accordingly overestimate the probability and aversiveness of unpredictable threat these finding support the notion of aberrant sensory processing of unpredictable threat in anxiety disorder a this processing pattern is already evident in individual at risk of these disorder,0.0
background patient with borderline personality disorder bpd feel ostracized even when they are included this might be due to a biased processing of social participation in bpd we examined whether patient with bpd also process social overinclusion in a biased manner i e whether they feel ostracized even when the degree of social participation is increased method an eeg compatible version of cyberball wa used to investigate the effect of inclusion and overinclusion 33 v 45 ball receipt on perceived ostracism need threat and p3 amplitude an eeg indicator for expectancy violation twenty nine patient with bpd 28 patient with social anxiety disorder sad and 28 healthy control hc participated result the p3 amplitude wa enhanced for patient with bpd and sad compared to hcs independent of condition both patient group reported more perceived ostracism relative to hcs in the inclusion but not in the overinclusion condition only patient with bpd reported stronger need threat in both condition conclusion the eeg result imply that being socially included violates the expectation of patient with bpd irrespective of the actual degree of social participation however when overincluded patient with bpd no longer feel ostracized except for need threat patient with sad might show a comparable bias in the processing of social participation a patient with bpd,1.0
adequate defensive responding is crucial for mental health but scientifically not well understood specifically it seems difficult to dissociate defense and approach state based on autonomic response pattern we thus explored the robustness and threat specificity of recently described oculomotor dynamic upon threat in anticipation of either threatening or rewarding stimulus in human while visually exploring naturalistic image participant 50 per experiment expected an inevitable no or avoidable shock experiment 1 or a guaranteed no or achievable reward experiment 2 that could be averted or gained by a quick behavioural response we observed reduced heart rate bradycardia increased skin conductance pupil dilation and globally centralized gaze when shock were inevitable but more pronouncedly when they were avoidable reward trial were not associated with globally narrowed visual exploration but autonomic response resembled characteristic of the threat condition while bradycardia and concomitant sympathetic activation reflect not only threat related but also action preparatory state independent of valence global centralization of gaze seems a robust phenomenon during the anticipation of avoidable threat thus instead of relying on single readout translational research in animal and human should consider the multi dimensionality of state in aversive and rewarding context especially when investigating ambivalent conflicting situation,0.0

background recent evidence ha shown that chronic back pain cbp can lead to functional alteration in the circuitry underlying the cognitive control of pain thought suppression t is a common type of cognitive control of pain previous research ha shown that t ha paradoxical effect that may increase the awareness of pain pain related t may also increase individual attention to pain which may also increase pain sensation but thus far the relationship between pain related t and structural brain alteration is unknown method in this study we investigated a group of 30 patient 6 month after lumbar disc surgery by applying voxel based morphometry vbm to identify brain region correlated with t score result since pain related t ha been positively correlated with depression all calculation were controlled for depression and age vbm revealed a negative correlation between the t score and regional grey matter volume gmv in the left superior temporal gyrus lstg and the left middle temporal gyrus l mtg which is part of the left temporoparietal junction l tpj in addition a mediation analysis revealed a significant mediation effect of the pain related t on the association between gmv of the left tpj and reported pain intensity in the last 7 day conclusion these finding are consistent with previous research on the dysfunctional cognitive control of pain and may therefore provide potential insight into the neural substrate of obstructive cognitive control in chronic low back pain with a special emphasis on pain related t significance the link between pain related thought suppression and brain morphology may provide a new perspective on the understanding of cognitive control of pain in chronic low back pain which may help improve cognitive behavioural therapy,1.0
emotion effect in event related potential erps during reading have been observed at very short latency of around 100 to 200 m after word onset the nature of these effect remains a matter of debate first it is possible that they reflect semantic access which might thus occur much faster than proposed by most reading model second it is possible that associative learning of a word s shape might contribute to the emergence of emotion effect during visual processing the present study addressed this question by employing an associative learning paradigm on pronounceable letter string pseudowords in a learning session letter string were associated with positive neutral or negative valence by mean of monetary gain loss or zero outcome crucially half of the stimulus were learned in the visual modality while the other half wa presented acoustically allowing for experimental separation of associated valence and physical percept in a test session one or two day later acquired letter string were presented in an old new decision task while we recorded erps behavioural data showed an advantage for gain associated stimulus both during learning and in the delayed old new task early emotion effect in erps were limited to visually acquired letter string but absent for acoustically acquired letter string these result imply that associative learning of a word s visual feature might play an important role in the emergence of emotion effect at the stage of perceptual processing,0.0

cognitive bias research draw upon the notion that altered information processing is key for understanding psychological functioning and well being however little attention ha been paid to the question of whether the frequently used experimental paradigm hold adequate psychometric property the present study examined the psychometric property of three widely used cognitive bias task the approach avoidance task aat the visual dot probe task and the implicit association test iat approach attentional and association bias towards valenced stimulus were repeatedly measured at five different time point in a sample of 79 healthy young adult two different device were used for assessment a personal computer pc and a touchscreen based tablet reliability estimate included internal consistency and temporal stability validity wa inferred from convergence across different behavioral task and correlation between bias score and self reported psychological trait reliability ranged widely amongst task assessment device and measurement time point while the dot probe task appeared to be completely unreliable bias score obtained from the pc based version of the aat and both pc and touchscreen version of the iat showed moderate reliability almost no association were found across information processing task or between implicit and explicit measure cognitive bias research should adopt a standard practice to routinely estimate and report psychometric property of experimental paradigm investigate feasible way to develop more reliable tool and use task that are suitable to answer the precise research question asked,0.0
basic research ha shown that the motoric system i e motor action or stable posture can strongly affect emotional process the present study sought to investigate the effect of sitting posture on the tendency of depressed individual to recall a higher proportion of negative self referent material thirty currently depressed inpatient either sat in a slumped depressed or in an upright non depressed posture while imagining a visual scene of themselves in connection with positive or depression related word presented to them on a computer screen an incidental recall test of these word wa conducted after a distraction task result of a mixed anova showed a significant posture x word type interaction with upright sitting patient showing unbiased recall of positive and negative word but slumped patient showing recall biased towards more negative word the finding indicate that relatively minor change in the motoric system can affect one of the best documented cognitive bias in depression practical implication of the finding are discussed,1.0
a reciprocal relationship between repetitive negative thinking rnt and negative affect na ha been found in various type of psychopathology recent study have suggested that the magnitude of this association can vary across time and individual which may inform future psychopathology here we explored how these dynamic and interplay are manifested in student and general population using a statistical clustering algorithm across three experience sampling data set our clustering analysis consistently identified two group of individual one group had a higher bidirectional association between rnt and na and also higher inertia than the other group furthermore a prospective analysis revealed that the group with the higher bidirectional association is at risk of developing depressive symptom during the 3 month follow up period if they had experienced high level of na over the experience sampling phase these finding suggest that the dysfunctional affective and cognitive dynamic would be a promising target of preventive intervention,1.0
objective thus far most application in precision mental health have not been evaluated prospectively this article present the result of a prospective randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of a digital decision support and feedback system which includes two component of patient specific recommendation a a clinical strategy recommendation and b adaptive recommendation for patient at risk for treatment failure method therapist patient dyad n 538 in a cognitive behavioral therapy outpatient clinic were randomized to either having access to a decision support system intervention group n 335 or not treatment a usual n 203 first treatment strategy recommendation problem solving motivation oriented or a mix of both strategy for the first 10 session were evaluated second the effect of psychometric feedback enhanced with clinical problem solving tool on treatment outcome wa investigated result the prospective evaluation showed a differential effect size of about 0 3 when therapist followed the recommended treatment strategy in the first 10 session moreover the linear mixed model revealed therapist symptom awareness and therapist attitude and confidence a significant predictor of an outcome a well a therapist rated usefulness of feedback a a significant moderator of the feedback outcome and the not on track outcome association however no main effect were found for feedback conclusion the result demonstrate the importance of prospective study and the high quality implementation of digital decision support tool in clinical practice therapist seem to be able to learn from such system and incorporate them into their clinical practice to enhance patient outcome but only when implementation is successful psycinfo database record c 2022 apa all right reserved,1.0
background current model suggest that a variation in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene 5 httlpr is associated with altered amygdala reactivity not only towards negative but also towards positive stimulus which ha been neglected in the past this association may possibly convey an elevated vulnerability for psychopathology like abuse craving and relapse since appetitive conditioning is a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of these psychiatric disorder the identification of specific factor contributing to interindividual variation is important method in the present study n 86 an appetitive conditioning paradigm wa conducted in which a neutral stimulus c wa associated with appetitive stimulus while a second stimulus c predicted their absence subject were genotyped according to the 5 httlpr genotype result a the main result we report a significant association between the 5 httlpr genotype and hemodynamic response individual with the s allele displayed elevated conditioned bilateral amygdala activity in contrast to l l allele carrier further increased hemodynamic response in s allele carrier were also found in the extended emotional network including the orbitofrontal cortex the thalamus and the ventral striatum conclusion the present finding indicate an association of the 5 httlpr and altered conditioned response in appetitive conditioning further the finding contribute to the ongoing debate on 5 httlpr dependent hemodynamic response pattern by emphasizing that s allele carrier are not exclusively biased towards fearful but also towards positive stimulus in conclusion our result imply that s allele carrier might be better described a hyper reactive towards salient stimulus which may convey vulnerability for the development of psychiatric disorder,1.0
negative expectation have been highlighted a a key mechanism in the maintenance and recurrence of depression nonetheless no study ha investigated currently depressed individual expectation about their future mood so far this is surprising given that experience of sustained negative mood and lack of positive mood are the hallmark symptom of depression the present study thus assessed depressed individual expectation about their future mood and examined whether these expectation are accurate or negatively biased the study used experience sampling methodology esm to contrast participant expectation with their actually experienced sad and happy mood within a 4 day period at the end of this period participant recalled their past mood all variable were assessed in 30 clinically depressed individual and 37 matched healthy control a well a in 56 undergraduate student with a wide range in depressive symptom result revealed that clinically depressed individual held negatively biased expectation about their future mood they expected more sad and le happy mood than they actually experienced in contrast healthy individual showed realistic expectation about their future mood depressed individual also demonstrated a negative mood recall bias finally individual expectation and memory were more closely linked to depression status than their actually experienced mood although negative mood is the hallmark symptom of depression the expectation and memory of negative mood may be even more central for the understanding of depression psycinfo database record c 2019 apa all right reserved,1.0
abstract background people with depression maintain negative expectation despite disconfirming positive experience by reappraising or discarding novel positive information referred to a cognitive immunisation a second body of literature suggests that negative mood can negatively affect information processing bridging these two line of research the present study examined the interplay of cognitive immunisation and negative mood in the context of expectation modification method in a student sample n 152 we used a well established experimental paradigm to examine the adjustment of performance expectation in response to positive performance feedback and it relation to depressive symptom in a 2 2 design participant received either a negative mood induction a cognitive immunisation manipulation both or no further manipulation result participant from all experimental group revised their previous expectation significantly in line with positive performance feedback however depressive symptom were a negative predictor of expectation adjustment and a moderation analysis indicated that this effect wa particularly pronounced if participant underwent the negative mood induction conclusion consistent with previous work depressive symptom were associated with a reduced ability to integrate positive information furthermore our result suggest that the activation of negative mood in people with elevated level of depression may hamper learning from new positive experience,1.0

background cognitive immunisation against disconfirmatory evidence i e devaluing expectation disconfirming information through cognitive mechanism ha recently been discussed a an obstacle to the revision of dysfunctional belief in mental disorder such a depression yet it is unclear whether cognitive immunisation is also involved in belief updating in non clinical sample method using a three group modulation protocol promotion v inhibition of cognitive immunisation v control group we examined how cognitive immunisation influence belief updating in response to performance feedback in three non clinical sample in experiment 1 n 99 and 2 n 93 participant received unexpectedly negative feedback whereas participant from experiment 3 n 118 received unexpectedly positive feedback depressive symptom and dispositional optimism were examined a additional predictor of belief updating result in all experiment participant adjusted their expectation in line with the feedback received but this effect wa not influenced by the cognitive immunisation manipulation in experiment 3 expectation change remained stable over 2 week depressive symptom were associated with a reduced integration of positive feedback but not with an increased sensitivity to negative feedback conclusion whereas previous research ha shown that cognitive immunisation contributes to persistent belief in clinical population the present finding suggest that it doe not affect belief updating in non clinical sample supplementary information the online version contains supplementary material available at 10 1007 s10608 021 10256 y,0.0
previous study have shown an attentional bias towards social feature during free viewing of naturalistic scene this social attention seems to be reflexive and able to defy top down demand in form of explicit search task however the question remains whether social feature continue to be prioritized when peripheral information is limited thereby reducing the influence of bottom up image information on gaze orienting therefore we established a gaze contingent viewing paradigm in which the visual field wa constrained and updated in response to the viewer s eye movement participant viewed social and non social image that were randomly allocated to a free and a gaze contingent viewing condition while their eye movement were tracked our result revealed a strong attentional bias towards social feature in both condition however gaze contingent viewing altered temporal and spatial dynamic of viewing behavior additionally recurrent fixation were more frequent and closer together in time for social compared to non social stimulus in both viewing condition taken together this study implies a predominant selection of social feature when bottom up influence are diminished and a general influence of social content on visual exploratory behavior thus highlighting mechanism of social attention,1.0
the covid 19 pandemic ha called worldwide for strong governmental measure to contain it spread associated with considerable psychological distress this study aimed at screening a convenience sample in germany during lockdown for perceived vulnerability to disease knowledge about covid 19 symptom of depression and anxiety and behavioral response in an online survey 1358 participant completed the perceived vulnerability to disease scale pvd the patient health questionnaire phq 4 and questionnaire on knowledge about covid 19 and self perceived change in behavior in response to covid 19 lower and upper quartile of the pvd were used to classify individual into low and high pvd a confirmatory factor analysis supported three factor representing risk preventive and adaptive behavior a behavioral response to covid 19 lockdown a structural equation model showed that the score of the knowledge scale significantly predicted the self reported increase in adaptive and preventive behavior the score in the pvd subscale perceived infectability predicted a self reported increase in preventive behavior whereas the germ aversion score predicted a self reported increase in preventive and a decrease in risk behavior the score in phq 4 predicted a higher score in the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales and a self reported decrease in adaptive behavior low medium and high pvd group reported distinct pattern of behavior knowledge and mental health symptom this study show that perceived vulnerability to disease is closely linked to preventive behavior and may enhance adaptation to covid 19 pandemic,1.0
threat can derive from our physical or social surroundings and bias the way we perceive and interpret a given situation they can be signaled by peer through facial expression a expressed anger or fear can represent the source of perceived threat the current study seek to investigate enhanced attentional state and defensive reflex associated with contextual threat induced through aversive sound presented in an emotion recognition paradigm in a sample of 120 healthy participant response and gaze behavior revealed difference in perceiving emotional facial expression between threat and safety condition response were slower under threat and le accurate happy and neutral facial expression were classified correctly more often in a safety context and misclassified more often a fearful under threat this unidirectional misclassification suggests that threat applies a negative filter to the perception of neutral and positive information eye movement were initiated later under threat but fixation change were more frequent and dwell time shorter compared to a safety context these finding demonstrate that such experimental paradigm are capable of providing insight into how context alters emotion processing at cognitive physiological and behavioral level such alteration may derive from evolutionary adaptation necessary for biasing cognitive processing to survive disadvantageous situation this perspective set up new testable hypothesis regarding how such level of explanation may be dysfunctional in patient population,1.0

with limited resource exploring new opportunity is crucial for survival exploring novel option however come at the cost of uncertainty therefore there is a trade off between exploiting option with a known beneficial outcome and exploring novel option with a potentially higher gain computational model have suggested that novelty may promote exploratory behavior by inducing a so called novelty bonus through reward related process so far few study have provided behavioral evidence for such a novelty bonus in this study we aimed to investigate whether spatial novelty can stimulate exploratory behavior experiment 1 and whether age novelty seeking and reduced action radius or social interaction due to covid 19 restriction influenced the exploration exploitation trade off experiment 2 in both experiment we employed a novel paradigm in which participant made binary decision between food item while on rare trial a surprise option wa presented result from experiment 1 are in line with a novelty bonus with spatial novelty promoting exploratory behavior in experiment 2 we found that exploratory behavior declined with age high novelty seeker made more exploratory choice than low novelty seeker and participant with a smaller action radius made fewer exploratory choice these finding are consistent with previous finding in animal and prediction from computational model,1.0
distorted cognitive processing ha been found among survivor of child maltreatment however different type of abuse and neglect may bring about difference in emotion and attention processing the present study aimed to detect differential association between various type of childhood maltreatment and attentional bias in facial emotion processing a non clinical sample wa recruited on university campus and consisted of 67 individual with varying degree of maltreatment in an evaluative conditioning task image of face with neutral emotional expression were either associated with short video of intense negative statement or associated with neutral video subsequently these face were used a stimulus in a face in the crowd recognition task in which the familiar face had to be recognized within a crowd of unfamiliar neutral face in multiple linear regression analysis controlling for the intercorrelatedness of type of maltreatment differential relationship between type of maltreatment and attentional bias were found while emotional abuse wa associated with faster detection of negatively associated face emotional neglect wa associated with an impaired recognition of familiar stimulus regardless of the emotional content result indicated that interindividual difference in cognitive bias may be due to the activation of diverse cognitive schema based on differential experience of maltreatment,1.0
because threatening situation often occur in a similar manner the generalization of fear to similar situation is adaptive and can avoid harm to the organism however the overgeneralization of fear to harmless stimulus is maladaptive and assumed to contribute to anxiety disorder thus elucidating factor that may modulate fear over generalization is important based on the known effect of acute stress on learning which are at least partly due to noradrenergic arousal we investigated whether stress may promote fear overgeneralization and whether we could counteract this effect by reducing noradrenergic arousal in a placebo controlled double blind between subject design 120 healthy participant underwent a fear conditioning procedure on day 1 approximately 24 hour later participant received orally either a placebo or the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol and were exposed to a stress or control manipulation before they completed a test of fear generalization skin conductance response a well a explicit rating data showed a successful acquisition of conditioned fear on day 1 and a pronounced fear generalization 24 hour later although physiological data confirmed the successful stress manipulation and reduction of noradrenergic arousal the extent of fear generalization remained unaffected by stress and propranolol the absence of a stress effect on fear generalization wa confirmed by a second study and a bayesian analysis across both data set our finding suggest that acute stress leaf fear generalization process intact at least in a sample of healthy young individual,0.0

child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd are characterized by symptom of inattention impulsivity and hyperactivity neurophysiological correlate of adhd include change in the p3 component of event related brain potential erps motivated by recent advance towards a more dimensional understanding of adhd we investigate whether adhd related erp marker relate to continuous variation in attention and executive functioning also in typically developing child erps were measured while 31 school child 9 11 year completed an adapted version of the continuous performance task that additionally to inhibitory process also isolates effect of physical stimulus salience child with higher level of parent reported adhd symptom did not differ in task performance but exhibited smaller p3 amplitude related to stimulus salience furthermore adhd symptom were associated with the variability of neural response over time child with higher level of adhd symptom demonstrated lower variability in inhibition and salience related p3 amplitude no effect were observed for erp latency and the salience related n2 by demonstrating that adhd associated neurophysiological mechanism of inhibition and salience processing covary with attention and executive functioning in a child community sample our study provides neurophysiological support for dimensional model of adhd also temporal variability in event related potential is highlighted a additional indicator of adhd requiring further investigation,0.0
uncontrollable compared with controllable painful stimulation can lead to increased pain perception and activation in pain processing brain region but it is currently unknown which brain area mediate this effect when pain is controllable the lateral prefrontal cortex pfc seems to inhibit pain processing although it is unclear how this is achieved using fmri in healthy volunteer we examined brain activation during controllable and uncontrollable stimulation to answer these question in the controllable task participant self adjusted temperature applied to their hand of pain or warm intensity to provoke a constant sensation in the uncontrollable task the temperature time course of the controllable task were replayed yoked control and participant rated their sensation continuously during controllable pain trial participant significantly downregulated the temperature to keep their sensation constant despite receiving the identical nociceptive input intensity rating increased during the uncontrollable pain trial this additional sensitization wa mirrored in increased activation of pain processing region such a insula anterior cingulate cortex and thalamus further increased connectivity between the anterior insula and medial pfc mpfc in the uncontrollable and increased negative connectivity between dorsolateral pfc dlpfc and insula in the controllable task were observed this suggests a pain facilitating role of the mpfc during uncontrollable pain and a pain inhibiting role of the dlpfc during controllable pain both exerting their respective effect via the anterior insula these result elucidate neural mechanism of context dependent pain modulation and their relation to subjective perception significance statement pain control is of uttermost importance and stimulus controllability is an important way to achieve endogenous pain modulation here we show differential effect of controllability and uncontrollability on pain perception and cerebral pain processing when pain wa controllable the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex downregulated pain evoked activation in important pain processing region in contrast sensitization during uncontrollable pain wa mediated by increased connectivity of the medial prefrontal cortex with the anterior insula and other pain processing region these novel insight into cerebral pain modulation by stimulus controllability have the potential to improve treatment approach in pain patient,1.0
objective deficit in explicit learning and memory have consistently been reported in adult adhd but it is le clear whether these deficit reflect deficient attentional process or specific dysfunction in memory process study on implicit learning and memory which are le dependent on the allocation of attention have rarely been conducted on adult adhd method we implemented a modified serial reaction time task that involves distracting stimulus to investigate implicit sequence learning in 32 adult participant with adhd and in 32 matched healthy control participant result the participant with adhd revealed unimpaired implicit learning performance but they made significantly more error than the control participant there wa no evidence for impaired error monitoring in the participant with adhd reflected by a comparable degree of double error and post error slowing in the two group conclusion reduced efficiency of the inhibition of incorrect response in implicit sequence learning support previous finding of impaired behavioral inhibition in adult adhd,0.0

previous research ha shown that food deprivation enhances the acoustic startle reflex when it is elicited during presentation of visual food cue frustrative nonreward may explain this effect since visual food cue are also rated to be more appetitive and arousing during food deprivation however the impact of menstrual cycle and sex on this effect remains unclear and it is also not known whether this effect is influenced by hunger and motivation to eat according to a within study design 20 healthy woman in different menstrual cycle phase and 14 healthy men participated twice in normal and food deprived condition after 18 h of food deprivation acoustic startle wa attenuated by appetitive nonfood foreground picture but enhanced by presentation of food picture no difference between menstrual cycle phase and sex appeared the effect correlated with hunger change suggesting that motivational factor play a role,0.0
in phobic individual behavioral response to phobia related cue are facilitated and brain response are augmented it ha rarely been investigated whether this preferential processing is accompanied by an altered conscious perception of phobia related cue we used binocular rivalry to investigate conscious perception of phobia related cue in phobic individual 21 spider phobic patient and 20 non anxious control participant viewed picture of spider or flower each paired with a neutral pattern under condition of binocular rivalry spider phobic patient more often reported that they saw spider picture a the first percept and the total duration of seeing spider percept wa significantly longer in patient than in non anxious participant a second experiment wa conducted to rule out that these difference were caused by different response criterion result support the validity of self report in experiment 1 in sum predominance of phobia related cue in binocular rivalry provides evidence that phobia related cue gain preferential access to visual awareness in phobic individual,1.0
background and objective mental disorder have been related to aberration in using novel positive information to revise established negative belief previous research used to make a binary distinction between belief confirming v disconfirming information but recently it ha been examined how varying level of positive information is used to update belief the present study aimed to replicate a recent finding suggesting that positive information that deviate to a large extent from people s prior expectation raise doubt about the credibility of new information and therefore hardly lead to change in expectation method in a heterogenous sample n 144 participant were provided with slightly positive moderately positive or extremely positive information in relation to their prior expectation about other people s behaviour result replicating previous research the present study found that expectation change wa greatest for moderately positive information it also provided evidence for a possible mechanism underlying the inverse u shaped relationship between the positivity of new information and change in expectation extremely positive information wa devalued through defensive cognitive strategy referred to a cognitive immunisation limitation unlike previous research the belief update task used in this study did not show any association with depressive symptom so it is questionable how suitable it is to study biased belief updating in depression conclusion unlike traditional learning model the present result suggest a tipping point above which the discrepancy between expectation and outcome is suspiciously large so that the degree of expectation change decrease,1.0
reward for approaching a feared stimulus may compete with fear reduction inherent to avoidance and thereby alter fear and avoidance learning however the impact of such competing reward on fear and avoidance acquisition ha rarely been investigated during acquisition participant chose between one option c option associated with a neutral stimulus followed by an aversive unconditioned stimulus u and another option c option associated with another neutral stimulus followed by no u n 223 randomized into three group in a subsequent test no more us occurred in one group competing reward were established by linking the c option to high reward and the c option to low reward during acquisition and test reward group in a second group reward were present during acquisition but discontinued during test initial reward group in a third group reward were completely absent no reward group without competing reward significant avoidance wa acquired and persisted in the absence of the u competing reward attenuated avoidance acquisition already after the first experience of the aversive u avoidance remained attenuated even when reward were discontinued during test reward did however not change the level of fear response to the c u expectancy skin conductance finally reward did not change the level of fear reduction during test which wa however experienced earlier summarized reward for approaching aversive event do not buffer fear acquisition but can prevent avoidance this damping of avoidance may initiate fear extinction,0.0

extinction learning is considered an important underlying process of successful treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd however sleep disturbance may impede this learning process current account postulate that sleep facilitates encoding by promoting neural plasticity during slow wave sleep sw based on this hypothesis we tested whether early night sleep with high amount of sw facilitates subsequent extinction learning and recall sixty three participant took part in a trauma adapted fear conditioning experiment one group received a three hour sleep opportunity in the early night half whereas the other group stayed awake thereafter both group underwent extinction training and a return of fear test retention wa assessed after another sleep opportunity in both group linear mixed effect model and bayesian inference did not support the hypothesis of strengthened fear extinction by prior early night sleep subsequent exploratory analysis in contrast point to a role of rapid eye movement sleep in promoting successful fear extinction learning further confirmatory research should re investigate these effect and their implication for the treatment of ptsd,0.0
bullying victimization by peer is highly prevalent in childhood and adolescence there is convincing evidence that victimization is associated with adverse mental health consequence in contrast it ha been found that perpetrator suffer no adverse mental health consequence these finding originate from western country such a germany but have rarely been investigated in collectivistic society such a china furthermore it ha been rarely studied whether positive intrapersonal characteristic e g personal resilience and self efficacy and interpersonal positive resource e g social support may mediate the impact of bullying on mental health the current study used a path analytic model to examine firstly whether previous bullying experience both victimization and perpetration are associated with current positive and negative mental health in university student and secondly whether these influence are mediated by social support resilience and self efficacy the model wa tested in 5 912 chinese and 1 935 german university student it wa found that in both country higher victimization frequency wa associated with lower level of social support personal resilience and self efficacy which in turn predicted poorer mental health moreover and only in china perpetration wa negatively associated with social support and personal resilience but not self efficacy in contrast in the german sample perpetration experience wa found to enhance one s self efficacy and the later wa associated with better mental health the result support a mediation model in which social support personal resilience and self efficacy partially mediate the influence of victimization on mental health in both country for the relationship between perpetration and mental health self efficacy wa the only full mediator in germany whereas in china both social support and personal resilience were partial mediator in conclusion peer victimization ha adverse effect on mental health in both germany and china only in china however is perpetration also associated with adverse mental health outcome in contrast getting ahead by bullying in an individualistic society such a germany is associated with increased self efficacy and mental health the difference found between an individualistic country and a collectivistic country have important implication for understanding and planning intervention to reduce bullying,1.0
it ha been debated whether working memory wm performance is modulated by the valence of the stimulus that are being processed a recent meta analysis revealed that at the behavioral level and in individual without mental health problem mean level performance difference in wm task with neutral versus affective condition are small to negligible we took this finding an important step further by employing a psychometric approach this is an important refinement of previous work because even in the absence of mean level difference differential processing of affective versus nonaffective information may still be occurring we examined whether at the construct level 2 latent wm factor could be distinguished in capturing the processing of neutral and affective stimulus respectively applying confirmatory factor analysis n 183 university student to a battery of 18 task 3 n back paradigm crossed with 3 stimulus type and neutral v affective valence the 2 factor correlated perfectly this result wa replicated when neutral stimulus were analyzed together with either positive or negative stimulus based on individual difference the processing of affective versus nonaffective stimulus in wm therefore cannot be distinguished at least not in a student sample of younger adult psycinfo database record c 2022 apa all right reserved,0.0
background and objective comorbidity between major depressive disorder mdd and alcohol use disorder aud is highly prevalent but reason for this association are unclear rumination may activate metacognitive belief that contribute to the development and maintenance of rumination and depression negative metacognitions can further lead to other dysfunctional coping strategy i e consumption of alcohol we examined whether alcohol reduces state metacognitions rumination and other disorder specific process in a group of individual suffering from mdd method in an experiment with three randomized condition we investigated whether the consumption of alcohol placebo or no alcohol orange juice affect meta cognition depressive symptom and or psychophysiological variable while participant ruminate result voluntary rumination increased self reported sadness tension and rumination tensed facial muscle and increased heart rate but did not affect state metacognitions and heart rate variability the consumption of alcohol did not influence rumination metacognitions depressive or psychophysiological measure limitation we recruited a depressed population but excluded pathological alcohol use due to ethical consideration conclusion we found no evidence that alcohol consumption affect rumination metacognitions and other disorder specific process in mdd however rumination had a negative effect on various depression specific process although it did not activate negative state metacognitions,0.0
background and objective negative evaluation process play a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of depressive symptom however it remains to be understood whether evaluation process in depression are impaired by maladaptive goal setting method in a non clinical sample n 50 of individual with high bdi ii score 13 29 and low bdi ii score 0 3 level of depressive symptom goal setting prior to working on a cognitive task wa measured goal feasibility wa experimentally manipulated using an easy and a difficult version of the task result when goal feasibility wa low a high level of depressive symptom wa associated with setting unattainable goal whereas individual with low level of depressive symptom adjusted their goal to a lower more realistic level when task difficulty increased individual with high level of depressive symptom initially adhered to significantly higher goal so that their performance failed to meet their self set standard after depressed individual revised their goal downwards their subsequent performance on the task also worsened limitation the use of a non clinical sample with self reported depressive symptom limit the generalizability of our finding to a clinical population future research would benefit from the use of a larger sample with patient suffering from clinical depression conclusion the finding support the notion that negative evaluation process in depressed individual might be linked with their tendency to generate intractable conflict between self set inappropriate high goal and their own capacity to perform however the finding need to be confirmed in clinical sample to draw conclusion about the role of goal setting in negative evaluation process in depression,1.0
objective psychopathy is characterized by severe deficit in emotion processing and empathy these emotional deficit might not only affect the feeling of own emotion but also the understanding of others emotional and mental state the present study aim on identifying the neurobiological correlate of social cognitive related alteration in psychopathy method we applied a social cognitive paradigm for the investigation of face processing emotion recognition and affective theory of mind tom to 11 imprisoned psychopath and 18 healthy control functional magnetic resonance imaging wa used to measure task related brain activation result while showing no overall behavioural deficit psychopathy wa associated with altered brain activation psychopath had reduced fusiform activation related to face processing related to affective tom psychopath had hypoactivation in amygdala inferior prefrontal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus area associated with embodied simulation of emotion and intention furthermore psychopath lacked connectivity between superior temporal sulcus and amygdala during affective tom conclusion these result replicate finding of alteration in basal face processing in psychopathy in addition they provide evidence for reduced embodied simulation in psychopathy in concert with a lack of communication between motor area and amygdala which might provide the neural substrate of reduced feeling with others during social cognition,0.0
objective in the past decade variation in outcome between therapist i e therapist effect have become increasingly recognized a an important factor in psychotherapy le is known however about what account for difference between therapist the present study investigates the possibility that therapist basic therapy related interpersonal skill may impact outcome method to examine this psychotherapy postgraduate trainee completed both an observer and an expert rated behavioral assessment the therapy related interpersonal behavior trib trib score were used to predict trainee outcome over the course of the subsequent five year result result indicate that trainee with more positively rated interpersonal behavior assessed in the observer rated group format but not in a single expert rated format showed superior outcome over the five year period this effect remained controlling for therapist characteristic therapist gender theoretical orientation cognitive behavioral or psychodynamic amount of supervision patient s order within therapist s caseload and patient characteristic patient age gender number of comorbid diagnosis global severity and personality disorder diagnosis conclusion these finding underscore the importance of therapist interpersonal skill a a predictor of outcome and source of therapist effect the potential utility of assessing therapist and therapist in training interpersonal skill are discussed,0.0
introduction acquired patella baja is often characterized by painful limitation of knee joint range of motion and anterior knee pain akp only few study have evaluated the effectiveness of surgical treatment in term of patient reported outcome measure prom s and sport activity thus the goal of this study wa to ass prom s and sport activity after proximalization tibial tubercle osteotomy p tto in patient with symptomatic patella baja method between 2016 and 2018 a case series of 11 patient male female 4 7 age 48 12 year were treated by p tto and were retrospectively evaluated after a mean of 33 7 month range 24 51 month the tegner activity score and the kujala anterior knee pain scale were used in addition to a visual analogue scale va 0 10 regarding self reported knee joint function and intensity of akp radiographic assessment included the measure of patellar height using the caton deschamps cd and blackburne peel bp index result postoperatively both the cd and the bp index increased to normality p 0 0001 p 0 0012 knee joint flexion improved from 100 32 degree preoperatively to 123 14 degree postoperatively p 0 0235 akp decreased from 6 5 2 1 point preoperatively to 3 7 2 1 point postoperatively p 0 0061 this wa accompanied by a significant increase in self reported knee joint function from 1 8 1 2 point preoperatively to 6 8 2 3 point postoperatively p 0 0001 and an increase of the tegner activity score from 1 8 1 6 point preoperatively to 3 9 1 5 point postoperatively p 0 0074 although the kujala score improved significantly by an average of 31 55 point p 0 001 overall score result remained reduced at 65 6 17 9 point at final follow up conclusion p tto yielded significant improvement in term of akp subjective knee joint function and sport activity however the overall kujala score result remained reduced indicating that surgical correction of patellar height is not sufficient to relieve all patient complaint in addition the incidence of postoperative complication wa high,1.0
objective the vigilance avoidance theory postulate a specific threat related pattern of attention deployment characterized by initial orientation towards fear evoking stimulus and subsequent directing of attention away from them the current eye tracking study wa the first to examine the applicability of the theory for patient with eating disorder who perceive their own body a a highly aversive threat evoking stimulus method n 56 female adolescent with anorexia nervosa an and n 43 healthy control hc aged 13 18 viewed own body picture while their eye movement were recorded relative fixation time on self defined unattractive body area were compared between the group by sequencing the overall presentation time of 6 000 m into six interval a 1 000 m result participant with an showed a significantly stronger attentional bias for unattractive body area than hc within the time interval 1 2 and 3 however for interval 4 5 and 6 no significant group difference occurred within the an group the bias for unattractive body area wa significantly stronger in interval 1 compared to interval 4 5 and 6 whereas within the hc group a stable pattern of attention deployment emerged in an early attention deployment wa positively correlated with the negative affect reported after photo presentation discussion the early vigilance in an and the subsequent decrease in attention to unattractive body part is in line with our assumption however no indication of attentional avoidance wa found the current finding partially support the vigilance avoidance theory for the exposure to one s own body in adolescent with an,1.0
research from the u s described a decrease of subjective well being and an increase of online medium use in young adult today the present study investigated whether similar trend occur in germany data of overall 1985 university freshman four cohort 2016 n 658 2017 n 333 2018 n 562 2019 n 432 were collected by online survey in the year 2016 to 2019 the comparison of the four cohort revealed a significant increase of depression anxiety and stress symptom a well a of the use of social platform from 2016 to 2019 in contrast positive mental health pmh significantly decreased over the year no significant change of the gaming behavior were found a slight significant positive relationship occurred between the negative variable of well being and online medium use the association between pmh and online medium use wa significantly negative thus cohort trend found in the u s can at least rudimentarily be replicated in germany young adult in 2019 seem to have lower level of well being and to engage in more use of social platform than older cohort,0.0
background defeat and entrapment have been shown to be of central relevance to the development of different disorder however it remains unclear whether they represent two distinct construct or one overall latent variable one reason for the unclarity is that traditional factor analytic technique have trouble estimating the right number of cluster in highly correlated data in this study we applied a novel approach based on network analysis that can deal with correlated data to establish whether defeat and entrapment are best thought of a one or multiple construct method explanatory graph analysis wa used to estimate the number of dimension within the 32 item that make up the defeat and entrapment scale in two sample an online community sample of 480 participant and a clinical sample of 147 inpatient admitted to a psychiatric hospital after a suicidal attempt or severe suicidal crisis confirmatory factor analysis cfa wa used to test whether the proposed structure fit the data result in both sample bootstrapped exploratory graph analysis suggested that the defeat and entrapment item belonged to different dimension within the entrapment item two separate dimension were detected labelled internal and external entrapment defeat appeared to be multifaceted only in the online sample when comparing the cfa outcome of the one two three and four factor model the one factor model wa preferred conclusion defeat and entrapment can be viewed a distinct yet highly associated construct thus although replication is needed result are in line with theory differentiating between these two construct,1.0
purpose subjective social status ss reflects individual perceived position in a social hierarchy low ss is associated with several mental health impairment the aim of this cross sectional study wa to examine if unemployed individual report lower ss in germany national ss and lower ss in their social community local ss than employed individual moreover the relationship between unemployment ss and mental health wa examined patient and method 113 unemployed and 1117 employed individual from a representative german panel provided information on their national and local ss their monthly income and their mental health ss wa assessed with the german version of the macarthur scale mental health wa measured using the mental component scale mc of the sf 12 result unemployed individual reported significantly lower national ss local ss and mental health compared to employed participant mediational analysis suggest that the negative effect of employment status on mental health wa explained via a reduction of national ss local ss did not mediate the association of employment status and mental health conclusion unemployment is associated with lower ss and reduced mental health the perceived position relative to others in the country ie national ss mediates the association between employment status and mental health,0.0
