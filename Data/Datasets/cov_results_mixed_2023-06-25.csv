The Mereology of Depression-Networks of Depressive Symptoms during the Course of Psychotherapy,"Holler, I.; Schreiber, D.; Bos, F.; Forkmann, T.; Teismann, T.; Margraf, J.",1 background research ha shown that it is important to examine depressive symptom in the light of the mereology the ratio between one symptom and the whole disorder the goal of this study wa to examine change in the symptom interrelation of patient undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy treatment cbt via network analysis 2 method outpatient with depressive symptom n 401 were assessed with the beck depression inventory three time pretreatment after 12 session and post treatment during cbt gaussian graphical model were used to estimate the relationship among symptom 3 result the severity of depressive symptom significantly decreased over the course of therapy but connectivity in the network significantly increased community of symptom changed during treatment the most central and predictable symptom wa worthlessness at baseline and after 12 session and loss of energy and self dislike at post treatment 4 conclusion the result indicate that the severity of depressive symptom decreased during cognitive behavior therapy while network connectivity increased furthermore the association among symptom and their centrality changed during the course of therapy future study may investigate individual difference and their impact on the planning of psychotherapeutic treatment,2022,Jun 10,Int J Environ Res Public Health,19,12,7131,35742380.0,10.3390/ijerph19127131,,#1,Holler 2022,Louis Schiekiera (2023-06-17 00:09:17)(Screen): pos; ,,en,1.0,,0
